v5jasYkmwZI,"Hi

I found the provided video to be highly informative and appreciate your effort Thank you

However I am encountering an issue while importing an Excel file into R specifically with converting dates in the format ddmmyyyy Despite utilizing the lubridate library and the parsedatetime function some dates are not being converted correctly

Upon further investigation with AI tools I discovered that Excel stores dates internally as numbers and the date column may contain mixed data types numbers and text This inconsistency leads to issues during date conversion in R as some values are imported as numbers Excel serial dates while others are imported as text

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue",1

_YG8b1g-QJA,Makes sense for sure even if its a tough break earlier on Also wonder how much this is a function of domain knowledge or lack thereof in the beginning I know some industries are more parochial when it comes to domain knowledge than others in terms of picking it up and allowing some leeway for the learning curve Finance seems to be one of those tougher domains in that regard in fact You pretty much have to learn domain at the same time as youre learning data analytics and thats beyond daunting unless you started out in business or finance and youre adding data instead of both at the same time,1

73S2SJSTgQU,"Hi Alex

I hope youre doing well Ive been following your content on YouTube for quite a while now  youre actually one of the key reasons I broke into the data analytics field without a university degree in CSE or Data so first off thank you for the inspiration and practical guidance

Ive been working as a data analyst here in Berlin for the past five years but to be honest Ive been struggling lately with a growing fear that our role as data analysts might become obsolete due to AI and automation With the pace things are moving it sometimes feels like its just a matter of one or two years before our entire skill set is automated away  and that uncertainty is weighing on me heavily

Since youre someone I look up to in this space I wanted to ask for your honest perspective where do you see the future of data analysis going with AI evolving so quickly Do you think theres still a sustainable path ahead in this field or should I seriously consider switching careers

Id truly appreciate any thoughts or advice youre willing to share  even or especially the brutally honest ones

Thanks again for all the value youve created for the community

Best Regards from Germany

dStNNjOKML4,"Hi Alex I just wanted to say that I just got hired as a Data Analyst Im starting on June I thank you for the majority of it I watched a lot of your guides and tutorials I started practicing around 2023 though I have a degree of programming as an IT graduate it is still different from data analysis I took the Google Data Analytics course from Coursera and started applying

In my country they dont honor the certificate but my advise for those aspiring Data Analyst is practice what youve learned and keep making portfolios After 2 years of rejection from my applications I was lucky enough that they hired me and was astonished with the things I learned Do not ever lose hope if you really wanted to become one always strive to learn and improve

So thank you Alex Thank you very much",1

z39SB95JbDo,Hello Alex I dont agree with you that shark attacks arent related to ice cream sales When a shark attack happens people stop swimming feel stressed and start buying more ice cream,1
z39SB95JbDo,You are so good that Chatgpt recommended you I just want to learn data analysis on YouTube before going for training that would certify me,1
z39SB95JbDo,While someone might try to rationalize it by saying Well higher temperatures mean more people buy ice cream AND those same higher temperatures mean more people go to the beach where sharks are so naturally both go up together  that elaborate explanation still doesnt mean ice cream causes shark attacks or vice versa It just shows how easy it is to build a story around a correlation that has a completely different underlying cause in this case the temperatureseason Always gotta watch out for those tempting but ultimately misleading rationalizations,1
z39SB95JbDo,The increase in temperature have a positive correlation with shark attack also  increase in temperature will also have a direct correlation with the ice cream sales,1

Also given the same condition as earlier explained would you say its better to separate them into two graphs one for percentages and the other for the baseline numbers",1

Data is only useful if theres something actionable from it and in the samples case increasing sales doesnt really tell you much and it actually lies by showing you that everythings doing great because its trending upwards If you look at  increase year by year at 2016 they increased sales by 4 but it actually started going down up to 16 in 2024 which may indicate that they need to be more aggressive in selling",1

k8nBWL6K884,I fell into healthcare analytics by accident I took a job collecting medical records onsite at various doctor offices hospitals and clearing houses I wound up learning roughly 35 different EHREMR systemsEpic Cerner etc and once COVID hit I was able to continue working remotely I was retrieving  15 charts per hour and a supervisor saw my potential I wound up in a pilot capacity program where eight of us would assist in forecasting how much volume we had vs how many remote processors we would need along with building a credential database within Exceland then weekly upkeeping to ensure the processors credentials didnt lapse to prevent retrieval This eventually led to an operational analyst role where I was responsible for 3 million medical records within 17 states for a healthcare client using SQL to download data and then updating databases in Excel I was laid off back in late summer 2023 but then found another remote healthcare analyst role at a company whose clients are pharmaceutical companies,0

k8nBWL6K884,"Hi alex can you please provide a solution or make a video on the following issue
The core problem stems from inconsistent and nonstandard naming conventions between the columns in the source document and the database  This is compounded by the fact that the columns are not in the same order  Essentially theres no reliable direct way to match a column in the source document to its corresponding column in the database just by looking at the names  This makes automated validation difficult  The large number of columns and rows exacerbates the problem making manual comparison only way but it is impractical",0

ItZlTixh6Bs,KPIs are good at saying Everything is fine or Something is wrong Often ratios or percentages They are massaged filtered indirect knowledge of the actual situation MBAs learn about them because they are not industry specific InventoryAnnual Sales They avoid getting your hands dirty knowing the actual specifics Lets say a purchasing agent used cheaper plastic 2 years ago and now many customers are switching to the competition due to poor longevity Which metric will specifically tell you the problem Something is wrong The senior guy can yell at the junior guy to fix the Sales metric And on down the line More marketing money fixes sales problems But no one will ever go back to the good plastic,0

hCmEfxy-BXg,"As someone who thought of wanting to be into big techs a few years ago just months ago makes me asking myself do I understand what I want Especially from a perspective where ive no degree in particular no knowledge whatsoever and also any knowledge former or latter about tech industry and its workplaces

This video makes me deepen my question im not saying he influenced me im just saying he is among those who made longer videos and thus expanded my thought process 

And I believe while upskilling myself I should just pursue whatever opportunity informed research that allows me to practice those knowledge Perhaps after 1 year ill find my purpose And if bigtech is still in my head ill go for it 

But as someone who also wanna matter I do want to consider smaller companies With less management and therefore less fruitful politics 

Thanks Alex I wish I can afford your course cause I earn only Malaysian RM hahahahaa

Sorry I replied to early hahaha RUTABAGA

Thanks again for making this video feel so real funny thing on the screen size and also happy travelling",0
hCmEfxy-BXg,"I listened to the end I havent found yet clarification why big tech is overrated in 2025 as of because they just had a big laying off  The info that youve shared it is mostly about why you dont like to work for a company cooperates and why you prefer to work as a consultant If you can share Why do a lot of people still rate those big techs in a top high ranking  It shouldnt be only the good benefit that been offered from them It should have more sides to talk about as well 

I think you mean that people dont need to aim to work with big techs only Small companies can be rating as same as big techs My opinion and experience Work environment and management politics in work places are same all over the world not only in big firms same in small firms Work with big firms you would get more chance to get bigger in career path while to work in small firms you will be stuck in short time and no benefit increased As well as you have to encounter the same matters and politics in both That is why big techs still be in a higher ranking that people value and want to work with",0

hCmEfxy-BXg,"if youre wondering how i watched it so fast x2 first of all rudabada or whatever and secondly good luck on the 12 hour drive 

now to the topic it depends on the stage you are in your career the reason why i liked your channel was because there was sort of a hand holding back then when people wanted to join analytics and it felt like hey weve got a friend to learn with 

There are still people at that stage they dont know if they want to make impact or add value they just need a wait for it a job Like let me just work ill worry about a lay off later Everything you said is miserable but a lot of people going into analysis role want to work and grow After applying to thousands of jobs I decided to freelance on Upwork and I remember a video you said people can try that and I was like erm its not that easy I wouldnt advice anyone to join Upwork or any freelancing site but people just want to move the needle in their careers 

Not everyone is even going to end up at big tech infact less than 1 statistically will but imagine being paid to do ETL i would do that even if I get laid off Even if it brings no value lol and if one day Im financially free enough to say is big tech worth it then I will hold another persons hand with a kleenex in between  and say do it first the decide 

all the best with your new monitor and have a nice holiday",1

oHte3qFa-oY,"Hi Alex

I followed your YouTube tutorial on Amazon QuickSight because I simply wanted to explore the service for learning purposes Unfortunately the video did not mention that once the Free Tier limit is exceeded AWS immediately bills the full monthly amount for QuickSight I enabled the service exactly as shown and have now been charged more than USD 600 in just a few days

As a student with a very limited budget and no commercial projects this unexpected expense is horrible I had assumed I would remain within a freetier or lowcost environment while experimenting",0

I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hi Alex Your calculations in the sumX section are WRONG  pls check

Your total profit is coming to 4347k which is basically the multiplication of total sales by total net profit instead of the total of individual profits of each product Hence the individual breakdown of profits is also wrong 

The correct profit is 432k 

Do a quick calculation in excel to see the problem",0

The total profit from all sales of all products actually turn out to be 4321243 I think using RELATED keyword and creating a measure Profit in Apocolypse  Sales table will solve this problem

Profit  SUMXApocolypse Sales RELATEDApocolypse StorePrice  RELATEDApocolypse StoreProduction Cost  Apocolypse SalesUnits Sold

I0vQ_VLZTWg,"hello and thanks for the video But im trying hard to understand your teaching method for someone who has very little knowledge of power bi and data analysis i dont understand some parts of your video Take for example  3201 you had 3 data sets inside that model customer information was the third and now you went over to the table view and i cant see customer information anymore where did it go to  what did u do with it help us 
understand what youre doing I feel like if youre moving on to another data set you should let us know because it is confusing thank you very much",0
I0vQ_VLZTWg,I am very thankful for this video in two days I am able to use Power Bi tool as well I was not new in Data Analytics but in Power BI I consider it is very important to be able to use different tools in BI relating to the needs,1
I0vQ_VLZTWg,you are awesomea pro found your video super useful for preparing for interview,1

j8FSP8XuFyk,Hi Alex learned a lot of small details Just starting out  after learning Looker Studio Are these dashboards are responsive  from larger screens to tablemobile phone,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,This helped massively cheers Alex Looking for a job as a fresher this really made visualization easier,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Your comment on Pie Charts is interesting  Pie Charts generally dont get the point across when you have more than 5 to 6 slices Any chart should tell a story clearly regardless if its a bar a pie line or scatter chart,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,Where does the demographic dataset come from tho,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you Alex this is great stuff I was sceptical about Tableau but your tutorials really helped break it down,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,Great video  a little slow paced but GREAT content,1

j8FSP8XuFyk,Not sure what happened at 3340  It didnt have a transition,-1
j8FSP8XuFyk,I am having problem with the maps in the final project  The first time Im dragging zipcode in Sheet 2 and choosing the maps visualization option the color isnt showing Its just a grey world map overall Tried zooming in but its not showing any color Please help How can i fix this,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Ive gotten PowerBI down pretty well but Tableau is a data visualization program that ive continually struggled with in regards to making professional looking dashboards Going to be watching this video and taking a lot of notes,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Helpful video,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,is it okay to put the final project of this video also the powebi project and excel final project in our portfolio,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,New to Tableau but not data analytics and visuals and I think you did a great job with this video It was easy to follow and you explained things well One minor note though I would keep the zero bedroom listings in your  analysis at the end because it likely represents studio units That is just a minor quibble though  Thank you what you video,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Hi
I have a KPI dashboard on Tableau Cloud that has a filter for hundreds of employees
Is there any way to export this report for each employee as PDF files Thanks",1
j8FSP8XuFyk,great video man helped a lot,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,tableau no longer give free versions you only get a 14 day trial,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Nice tutorial Just one point I think should be better explained the joins

Its always recommended to use relationships because they allow to have more flexibility and you get the data correctly almost in all cases 
Joins are deterministic for the full project and dont allow personalization within visualizations Data with Baraa has a video explaining this perfectly Tableau Joins vs Relationships

In your example in the last visualization where you count the number of Bedrooms available you get a wrong count due to the Inner joined you used previously Just because a bedroom listing doesnt have dates available in the calendar table doesnt mean its not listed this always depends on what you interpret of course
It just hit me because I used a left join because I interpreted that listings dont need to have calendar entries in order to exist and so I got higher numbers in the bedroom count",1
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thanks Alex I learned a lot,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,What a legend,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,658,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you for giving a basic overview of various functionalities of Tableau in an easy and effective manner However my maps are not showing color or labels for example prize per zipcode,1

j8FSP8XuFyk,I tried working this out from canada the map dint work out for me any way to change the Geo,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,5643,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,While this is very helpful learning Tableau you really need to use Google Maps to look at the street view of zip code 98134 Its a downtown Seattle industrial area Ive been there While its very interesting to drive around Its not a good place to live unless you like watching shipping and railroad activity,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,what df btw the video vs the analystbuilder course if do not need a certificate,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Im just starting out on the data analyst world Question will this videos tableau help me prepare for the tableau certification,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,in the starbucks dataset why is it only showing postcodes for the US only Im from india and it shows me postcodes for India alone Why so,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,thank you much appreciated,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you so much for the video,1
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Nice video but you should review relationships and joins as the explanation was not correct 

Relationships are not almost the same as joins just not as customizable They are the way of telling Tableau how tables should be joined in case the visualization requires the join to happen The benefit is that the join is not done before the Viz so that the source data can be maintained without possibly filtering out records due to a join

Also Tableau recommends not doing joins unless absolutely necessary",0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you for putting all your Tableau tutorials together Would it be possible to see you walk through a new mini project with the updated data or on a different topic It would be greatly appreciated,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Great video,1

j8FSP8XuFyk,Hello Alex can you tag me on your video on testing hypothesis using crosstabs Thank you,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,Do you have paid online training,0
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Nice video Really appreciate the style and approach youve taken here Just one note at 3500 its worth mentioning that relationships in Tableau are often significantly more performant and flexible than traditional joins Relationships allow you to answer questions that would be difficult if not impossible to address with joins alone For example with a join you might struggle to identify which job titles arent represented in your demographics or pinpoint demographics without corresponding job titles Joins interface is very much goign to be the legacy approach vs the modern approach especially to get things working with semantic models and tableau pulse and other published data sources 

Using relationships can also reduce the number of connections needed streamlining your data model Kirk Munroe has an excellent indepth video  on the benefits of relationships and its a common misconception that Tableau lacks this capability especially in comparisons to Power BI",1

t1fQBD4B7xk,the function tutorial at 12028  please note that number in this case is defining any type of variable not just integers for example if you want to add to the list in the example you could say  number colour and further define colour  red  in this case red in reality isnt a number but defined in this case as the called variable ie number  Id say the better example here is to use variable instead of number to explain cuz it is really a name to be defined not a type of data Could also be called name  facts or whatever,1

I ran into issues with totallaidoff fundsraisedmillions and percentagelaidoff being treated as TEXT instead of numeric types
I converted totallaidoff and fundsraisedmillions to the proper data type INTEGER That was probably my mistake during data import
However in the tutorial Alex uses percentagelaidoff as TEXT in aggregate functions It worked by coincidence because values like 1 09 075 05 etc maintain the same order both alphabetically and numerically
Still I believe best practice is to store all numeric values as numeric types  especially when using SQL where INTEGER or FLOAT for decimals should be used instead of TEXT",1

rxyLC247h6E,if it doesnt let you create Quicksight Youll have to go to IAM Identity Center and add the application,0
rxyLC247h6E,Hello great video  Have a question In QuickSight I have set up the standard calendar and have the ability to choose a date and send it as a parameter to the backend query In the calendar itself is there a way to mask dates  today It should be something straightforward PowerBi has this facility  Something like an option Click to mask the dates greater than todays date and then when the Calendar pops up I have only until today  Is there  a simple way to do programatically,1
rxyLC247h6E,"Hi Alex

I followed your YouTube tutorial on Amazon QuickSight because I simply wanted to explore the service for learning purposes Unfortunately the video did not mention that once the Free Tier limit is exceeded AWS immediately bills the full monthly amount for QuickSight I enabled the service exactly as shown and have now been charged more than USD 600 in just a few days

As a student with a very limited budget and no commercial projects this unexpected expense is horrible I had assumed I would remain within a freetier or lowcost environment while experimenting",0
rxyLC247h6E,Btw Save as Analysis saves a copy of your current report analysis In QS the reportanalysis saved automatically once you started it it just there Forever Also the only way you can delete it if you go to list of reports if you search for it  you wont be able to delete it It so so basic but is getting better,1

UTMuL_86gSQ,Is the land a job course included in any of the bundles,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,Sir  that entire stuff  enough to get a job,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,Is learning from your YouTube channelBootcamp enough for becoming a data analyst  Because I dont have that much money to buy your course,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,I have started today see you next 6 months,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,I would have gone for the course but my country doesnt have international payment system so i guess I will have to wait till it gets available for free in youtube,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Is the course on ur website free 
Coz i am looking for handson practice for all topics",1
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hi will there be a new discount code for the course i really want to buy the lifetime access bundle,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Is this an industry recognized Certification Or just certificates of completion

Ive seen you and many other data analysts saying Google DA Certifiate is not good enough even for entry level positions because recruiters and hiring managers want professional certification versus certificates od completion 

That said the Coursera and Google stuff is a good starting point to learn but wont get you an interview Is your Analyst Builder Roadmap more like the Coursera stuff or more like the actual certifications from Microsoft or Tableau",1
UTMuL_86gSQ,Will I have access to the data analyst roadmap if I subscribe to the monthly plan,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hellow Alex if you can make an interview or can bring a hiring manager what they expect from a fresher and how to answer the questions correctly that will be helpful to many people I assume,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,I am a great fan of your bootcamp I am watching your video 2021 I am a continous learner Love to see if I miss anything valuable,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,Has anyone gotten a job by doing datacamp Just curious,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hi Alex Thanks for sharing your roadmap its super helpful I have a quick question If I want to take your MySQL Advanced course should I do it right after the first MySQL course or wait until after completing Excel for Data Analytics and the other ones Also are you planning to create an Advanced Python Programming course in the future Thanks in advance,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,Im trying to learn a skill beside my main work I want to know is DA is relevant in 2025 with a lot of ai developments Sorry it might not be a great question,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I hope Im not being rude by asking this but how would this compare to the Google or IBM data analyst courses on Coursera How is it better Why should we choose this over them

They also offer certificates that can be put on our LinkedIn and I assume theyll be better recognized than the ones from Analyst Builder

In terms of pricing your Road map is 150 I assume to get access for forever 

Coursera plus is 400 per year But Im getting it for 240 right now till 2nd Dec And for those in Asia Africa or East Europe They can get it for 140 for one year if they get it before 20 Jan 2025
With Coursera plus for a year you could do multiple courses and not just the one on data analysis

Now in older videos of 2021 it has been mentioned the Google and IBM had monthly charges But Ive not seen that anywhere in November of 2024 

So if Im missing something in terms of money required or better learning experience please dont hesitate to correct me",1
UTMuL_86gSQ,I would like to know what you would choose between your courses and Google DA  I would like to attend both but I dont know which one first Im someone with no background experience,1

UTMuL_86gSQ,Is becoming a data analyst still worth it  for 2025 I want a career change and i been seeing vidoes about data analytics and its interesting but people say since its so saturated that its hard to find a job especially if you dont have experience idk what to do lol,1
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hello Alex how would this course compare to that of the google certificate course Would employers view it equally or should I try to finish both courses Thanks,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,Will we get lifetime access in this course if we buy,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,I know its a tough job market but will this roadmap likely to get someone hired on its own or does one need a related degree as well to get hired,0
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Started listening to the Data Career Podcast and came across your channel I started the IBM DA course on Coursera and was a good ways into Python but I felt I was just consuming content Labs were okay but not as in depth as I needed 

I have been content dumping on your channel man You make it easy to learn and get motivated to learn more Cant wait to start the roadmap",1

wJiJXD7MVoY,1100 When the analysis defines full time vs pt time as binary 35hr or 35hr that gets tricky because during a tough economy some employers may not necessarily lay off their employees but rather cut their hourly employees hours that they work For example when the pandemic hit healthcare got a massive surge in money and hospitalspharmacies were able to pay their nurses and techs for 40 hours of work every week But now with less demand for healthcare services healthcare is going through budget cuts so rather than laying off half their staff they are instead changing their hours worked from 40 hours a week to 32 hours a week,0

5q2u8__sVhs,For big files with a lot of tricky formulas I sometimes keep a kind of change tracker on a separate sheet I make a list of all the formulas in the workbook use FORMULATEXT to show them as a string and copy paste as values in a helper column next to it Conditional formatting to show if the FORMULATEXT differs from the pastedasvalues version and I can tell at a glance where I made edits or someone else broke something,1
5q2u8__sVhs,Hi Alex your videos have been helping me a lot so I wanted to reach out and extend my thanks and appreciation You should do a coding booting similar to the data analyst bootcamp where we get a certificate at the end Id definitely sign up for it Keep up the good work,1

5q2u8__sVhs,"Hey Alex Theres actually a little inconsistency in the first method PMT

If you take the first monthly payment for ex 47178 over the period 5 x 12 months  youll get 283068
But 25000 capitalized annually at an interest rate of 5 per year will return a Future Value of 3190704

The reason for this is because the compound interest used preferably in the economy In order to achieve the same value you should convert the annual interest rate in monthly interest rate too

F5v2dRYU5IA,For the slide at 5600 how common or uncommon is it to get hard questions on an entry level role I have a final technical interview in a few days and am so worried because I definitely feel confident to do the first level and mostly ok with second level still somewhat struggle with subqueries but definitely struggle with things beyond that Im so nervous and anxious about it I didnt really learn SQL anywhere formally just on the job as Ive needed so I know theres a lot that I dont know,0

F5v2dRYU5IA,What did I miss  Why cant I see the tables when going over the SQL interviews,0
F5v2dRYU5IA,"I recently had a frustrating interview experience On a job description that I felt like I matched perfectly technical and experience wise

I was upbeat smiling and confident eager to learn what I might not know during the interview and clearly displayed knowledge of the tech in Questions but I was pre tested before both technically and personality wise  by this consulting recruiter company

Im fairly in the middle when it comes to extrovert introvert But may score slightly one way or the other depending on the test

I had a 3 person interview and was just grilled me left and right from all three interviewers to the point where they were all interrupting me and each other and they didnt even ask me to tell me about myself

Im hind site I wish I would have slowed them down and been like wait a minute can we go one step at time I could have answered some of their vaguer questions more in depth

Felt like a power shit show  has anyone ever had this 10 years of job experience and Ive never had one quite this unprofessional and all over the place

F5v2dRYU5IA,Can u release power bi course  on your website,0
F5v2dRYU5IA,"My 2 cents 
in the information era its very important to show the most you can too 

Im no developer or what but Ive been wanted for a position where I had to use Python to retrieve data and you know what I was beeing chosen even if I genuinely told the cofounder of the company that I just used Python to run some exercise using pandas and numpy but since I had never had a true reason to use it Ive never got myself involved in deeper learning 

In that case he was happy cause could see a person that had other experiences but was also open to learn more and more 

Then also to surprise them 

For the same company I had to attend 4 interviews and in one I was asked too whether I could use an aumation tool that could cant remember which one and I tested it in the 2 previous days So I had no relevance of such info on my CV but when I had the interview I saidIve never worked with such tool but I tested a couple of times and could create a dashboard and send it to emails given some rules 

So maybe you cant now today but this doesnt mean you cant learn it",1

QYd-RtK58VQ,I really learnt a lot its been great listening and learning right from the beginning to this point Kudos to me Thanks Alex,1
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I think there might be an error in the exploratory data analysis section
I ran into issues with totallaidoff fundsraisedmillions and percentagelaidoff being treated as TEXT instead of numeric types
I converted totallaidoff and fundsraisedmillions to the proper data type INTEGER That was probably my mistake during data import
However in the tutorial Alex uses percentagelaidoff as TEXT in aggregate functions It worked by coincidence because values like 1 09 075 05 etc maintain the same order both alphabetically and numerically
Still I believe best practice is to store all numeric values as numeric types  especially when using SQL where INTEGER or FLOAT for decimals should be used instead of TEXT",1

QYd-RtK58VQ,I definitely dont have the same results that he has most of the things are the same but I dont have quibi in my dataset I guess because my Null values were actually text and I deleted those from the percentage laid off column based off the logic of I dont have the company size or total number of employees I cant move forward so I removed them,0

QYd-RtK58VQ,"I would kindly like to give some feedback In this video there was not much emphasis given to the precentagelaidoff However I find this to be statistically important data This is a proportion and gives a probability For example if you were to query SELECT stage ROUNDAVGpercentagelaidoff2
FROM layoffsstaging2
GROUP BY stage
ORDER BY 2 DESC you would find the proportion of layoffs per company as opposed to just finding the companies that got rid of the most people The argument here is that a large company with a layoff proportion of 005 could still show more people being laid off then a smaller company with a layoff proportion of 07 even though this gives valuable insight that the past 3 years have hit small companies very hard Thought I would mention this and open it up to any discussion",1

BV5ckMNNvi4,Hi Alex I really appreciate all the content and knowledge you share I am 38 and just started selfstudying data analytics Can you really be honest and tell me if I have a chance of being a data analyst Why I have doubts is because there are so many freshers out there who will be preferred over me and also so many experienced professionals got laid off who will again be preferred over me with no CS degree Though I would like to add is that if I am into something I really excel in it I am working for 20 years now and in every single job I have exceled and been promoted I believe in myself,1

Congratulations on Analyst Builder I always recommend to everyone who wants to go into the field",0
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Great to see your insights on being promoted Ive been in the Data Field for almost 3 years now and this has been my progression

1 First Data Analyst Job I got this a year after college With covid happening in 2020 I wanted to try to sell SEO marketing and I failed horribly Had a degree in Electrical Engineering which helped me land the first job but also feels like it was a giant waste of time
2 After my first big project at the new job I got a 100 a month raise
3 Started working a ton with the executive team and the company moved me from Marketing to Engineering for reporting Recieved a 10k raise
4 There was no room to grow Told no use cases for python or Data Science in the company  no raises looked for a new job Landed a Job at a fintech first 6 figure job where I could grow into a Data Science role  use python
5 My Department got obliterated boss left every other data person went to different departments or left the company Stayed in my role and learned as much as I could about Mode DBT Streamlit Langchain so that I could build internal BI tools to optimize the teams procedures  reporting which was almost nonexistant or incorrect
6 Title change to Data Scientist Still only data person in a full RiskUnderwriting Dept and 3 raise not happy about the raise part especially taking on multiple peoples old work

I didnt study new Data concepts at my first job I thought I would be able to learn at the job which was a huge mistake in growth When I started looking for my next job I made a YouTube channel to force myself to study I should also note I was able to land my 2 jobs through networking as well My Fintech job I got through a connection on my sports card YouTube channel Really curious how connections will help on the data side of things Its almost a year with this channel and have made over 100 vids almost at 6k subs

Anyways watched your vids when I was trying to land my first job it was super helpful",0

7b8ViCqD9JM,Thanks a lot for your videos How would you know which ones are legit though,1
7b8ViCqD9JM,I need to do this more Ive heard some jobs arent actually advertised and if anything youll have less competition applying directly,1
7b8ViCqD9JM,"Recruiters are great  but they really dont accomplish a ton until you get into more senior roles The biggest advice for a job seeker  APPLY ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE 

I landed so many more interviews by applying directly with employer than I ever did applying through LinkedIn or any other job board My hit rate with corporate job boards was easily 50x higher than any third party job board 

When you start applying for manager or executive roles then you really need to have a recruiter working for you Often the recruiters for management and higher roles have a connection to the hiring managerELTBoard and that will make all the difference 

My last job change took me from a senior analyst role to a directorsenior manager role because I had a good recruiter working with me",1

UC7uvOqcUTs,Hey Alex  some table does not exist  Can you tell me how to fix it,0
UC7uvOqcUTs,can i select and add first name and last name in this CTE query if yes then please tell me how do I write this query,1
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Common Table Expressions CTEs  excellent for improving readability maintainability and reusability

CTEs are temporary result sets defined within the execution scope of a single SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE or MERGE statement This temporary result set is then available within the main SQL query CTEs offer several advantages that make them an attractive option

1 Readability CTEs allow you to break down complex queries into more straightforward more readable parts Giving each part of the query a meaningful name can make the overall query structure more intuitive and easier to understand
2 Maintainability When using CTEs changes to the query logic need only be made in one place reducing the potential for errors This is particularly useful when dealing with large complex queries using the same logic in multiple places
3 Reusability A single CTE can be referenced multiple times within the same query This eliminates the need to repeat the same subquery or temporary table making your code more concise and efficient
4 Recursion CTEs support recursive queries which help deal with hierarchical data structures such as employee hierarchies or bills of materials Recursive CTEs allow you to traverse these structures efficiently and elegantly

Temporary Tables  offer better performance with large datasets 

Temporary tables are actual tables created within the database session that persist through that session They offer some advantages over CTEs

1 Indexing Temporary tables can be indexed significantly improving query performance especially when dealing with large datasets
2 Persistence Temporary tables persist throughout the database session allowing you to reuse them across multiple queries without redefining them

However temporary tables also have some drawbacks

1 Overhead Creating and dropping temporary tables adds overhead to your SQL script You need to explicitly manage their lifecycle which can make your code more complex
2 Maintenance If your script creates many temporary tables keeping track of them and ensuring they are properly cleaned up can become challenging

Subqueries  helpful for simple cases but can become less readable and performant as complexity grows

Subqueries are queries nested within another SQL query They can achieve similar outcomes to CTEs but have some limitations

1 Readability When a query becomes complex or the same subquery is used multiple times the code can become less readable and more challenging to maintain
2 Performance In some cases subqueries may not be as performant as CTEs or temporary tables especially when dealing with large datasets

Performance Considerations

When choosing between CTEs temporary tables and subqueries its essential to consider the performance implications CTEs are not stored as objects and do not have statistics like temporary tables so they may only sometimes be the best choice for performancecritical operations especially with large datasets In these cases using temporary tables with indexes might be more efficient

However the performance differences between these techniques can vary depending on the specific database management system and the nature of the query Its always a good idea to test and benchmark your queries to determine which approach works best for your particular use case",1

UC7uvOqcUTs,"Now this is actually a start of advance level  I have to go through sub queries window funtions and CTES again and again to clear the concepts along with real data problems remeber we have to think through a raw data to create a logic to solve data problems using all these tools like group by  window funtion sub queries ctes etc Think and analyse which tools are best for certain conditions

Select teslamodel carprice carssold productioncost carpriceproductioncostcarssold as Profits
From TeslaSalesTeslaModelSales
Order By Profits Desc

Edit I viewed the solution and the postgreSql is the closest one to my answer so right now ill do it in postgreSql and learn whats the difference between postgeSql and ssms

also Im still getting it wrong 
this is my solution

Select teslamodel carprice carssold productioncost carpriceproductioncostcarssold as Profit
From teslamodels
Order By Profit Desc
LIMIT 1

and this is the write answer

SELECT teslamodel carprice carssold productioncost
  carprice  productioncost  carssold AS profit
FROM teslamodels
ORDER BY profit DESC

Whats the difference I cant see the difference in here but its flagging my solution as wrong I only added the Limit 1

First whats missing




Ron is missing from the pool of Men Important if youre trying to do data analysis on gender pay disparity as is the case here Its not uncommon to see issues like this in production where you have to clean and synthesize data from multiple tables Of course in the real world wed be getting Rons data added back to the demographics field perhaps with a null for birthday

The city manager wants to make sure that Ron Swanson is included in the buildup use a CASE statement to assign Ron to the Male field This ones surprisingly tricky because of how the partition statement sits in the order of SQL operations",1

Vj6RqA_X-IE,ALEX Awesome guide This video is very easy to understand for beginners which i appreciate Just a quick question on the aggregate function AVG in the subquiery Why doesnt it require a GROUP BY statement,1
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"At 2 35 when you get the results of the subqueryIm not Im getting the results of the full query bc Ive been hitting the bolt w the I on it instead of the bolt by itselfwhich is what youre doing in the video but not mentioning which bolt youre hitting and why

Also I dont understand WHY you would do what you did from 800 on

Vj6RqA_X-IE,Thanks alex for the easy explanation just a question when you wanted to compare the salaries to avg salary we also can use Partition by instead of s subquery right,1

RYIiOG4LsvQ,Hi Alex been following the bootcamp for a longtime Im just wondering about the data with the employee with the deptid 6 since he should have a 10 increase but also get affected by the other case statement of 7 increase is there any way that the 7 increase will not affect this guy with in the finance department instead getting the 10 increase data,0
RYIiOG4LsvQ,WHEN age  50 good night,1
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Your tutorials and way of explaining is really really good this stuff is really interesting and I am really enjoying studying because of you thank you soo much,1

RYIiOG4LsvQ,31  50 is old,0
RYIiOG4LsvQ,excuse me im still not understand with salary  105 and salary  10 why use 1 and in 10 for bonus is why use 10 and not 110,0
RYIiOG4LsvQ,unfair increase rate especially for tom and jerry plus the imbalance increase rate resulting larger salary gap boohoo,-1

_nf56aMPdZE,20 dollars for this Thats way overprized Most people will just use chatgpt and CTRLC and CTRLV In Excel its really really bad as well Maybe i was expecting too much,0
_nf56aMPdZE,"This was too basic for me but it gives a bit about where to find and maybe leverage copilot

I might have to finish this later",0
_nf56aMPdZE,"I agree Copilot for excel its not great for data analyst data Science types I just took a copilot  for a test run today and couldnt get it to do anything more than some superficial stuff  I tried to get it to run a simple linear regression on a small dataset of advertising expenditure vs sales data which I can get to work using a program like Chat GPT 4 copilot failed miserably basically said you couldnt do regressions in excel which I guess is technically true without data analysis add in enabled

That said I agree it might be useful for people who have no idea how to use excel The problem with that conclusion is that I feel like copilot is an expensive add on and it doesnt really seemed to be marketed to that demographic of user Like all the promotional stuff the last year seemed targeted to more power users It requires you have a business 365 license which I mean most people running that at least have a decent working knowledge of MS Office

So  Ill play around with more another week before
Rendering a final verdict but off the cuff first impression Im not that impressed with it seems more like Mr Clippy from yesteryear",0

_nf56aMPdZE,Just like with Gemini there is a built in bias in responses such as the response I received to the name of a Brother that taught me in Catholic High School It preceded the response to the Brothers details with a paragraph of another Brother who 30 years later was found to have kid porn on his computer Totally irrelevant to the question asked but obviously part of the anti Catholic algorithm,0
_nf56aMPdZE,Thanks Alex for the video great overview I run office on 2021 not 360 so Im guessing users like me also have to factor in this second subscription Id say from what you shared for a nonbeginner like me probably not worth it Im sure this service will get much better although maybe pricier too in the months and years ahead though,1

_nf56aMPdZE,"i am farmer and its really hard for me to keep the record of data mostly money like crop costs or lend money from others i thought i could use AI on my mobile inside copilot chat app like just writing add 500 in fertilizer column or add 2000 earning in 2023 wheat or paddy 2023  its a hassle to start my desktop and write one particular thing i could do it on the time sometimes i forget i got money from that guy or gave him this amount of money i am pretty much sure Microsoft can do this and they will improve this in future but they are just scared from people for there privacy breached like people would criticise them for it i would love to get that type of thing with AI and i dont know i can pay 20 dollars but i think AI should be free in future at least it should like google search engine was copilot chat is already free tho so thats good thing

I am not going to pay for copilot until they do this type of improvement",1

_nf56aMPdZE,Been waiting for this it is expensive given that it comes on top of the Office 365 subscription and has mediocre functionality This iteration is def not worth the  better to learn Excel,0
_nf56aMPdZE,Seems to me it will only help people who have very limited skills in excel Changing a data format is much easier to do manually could do it in the time it took to type the requirement A product like this surely comes in to its own when you have a ton of data so it not being able to handle or help with the more complicated areas such as splitting out text in one column is weakness Again can be done by formula find or using the other built in separation tools 710 for basic users for more advanced it looks more like a 310  Good video though as totally informative and balanced,1

KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Lesson11 Conclusion

So we have covered multiple string functions
1LENGTH  This will calculates the total no of characters present in the desired output
2UPPER  To convert all the characters to uppercase form
3LOWER  To convert all the characters to lowercase form
4TRIM  Removes unwanted blank spaces from left and right
    LTRIM  Removes unwanted blank spaces from left side only
    RTRIM Removes unwanted blank spaces from lright side only
5LEFT  To select specific character starting from the left side
6RIGHT To select specific character starting from the right side
7SUBSRING  To select specific characters by mentioning start and end points
8REPLACE  To replace specific character with the desired character
9LOCATE  This will locate specific characters with 0 if not found 1 if found
10CONCATE  This will combine the characters of 2 different coloumns

iTQW_nDp938,"UNION is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set  key points about using UNION

Distinct rows only By default UNION removes duplicate rows
Same number of columns Each SELECT query must have the same number of columns
Column data types must match The corresponding columns should have compatible data types

You can use UNION ALL if you want to keep duplicate rows in the final result",0

iTQW_nDp938,"If someone is over 50 years old were gonna try to push them out
Sir thats ILLEGAL",-1
iTQW_nDp938,"quick note

if you have UNEQUAL ROWS 
set the columns which are present on the econd database table but not the fist database table as NULL
set the columns which are present on the first database table but not the second database table as NULL

since union actually merges so it will create additional rows to merge those columns NOW IF WE PUT NUILL IT WILL MATCH THE UMBER OF ROWS",0
iTQW_nDp938,NOTE  Just copied this comment from the STRING FUNCTIONS lesson where I had entered it by mistake     Well that was fun  Ending my day with Alex the Analyst while my lovely Bride is preparing dinner Im one lucky WannaBeDataNerd  Somehow UNION just makes more sense than JOINS for me  I just need more exposure and practice  like this Intermediate MySQL Series for example  Thanks again Alex,1

fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Some of the easy questions start turning into medium questions when you consider the nested functions like with the COSTCO ROTISERIE CHICKEN scenario                                                                   SELECT ROUNDCASTSUMlostrevenuemillions AS DECIMAL 0 AS TotalLoss  FROM sales

fT-8mRf_-Hk,This is really a great platform,1
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Honestly these questions are easy level,1
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Thanks for sharing always,1
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"As these interview questions get more difficult it also gets more important to validate the data In the second example the data set is small enough to visually confirm that the error is uniform

If that dataset was 10000 rows long it will not be practical nor would it be possible to validate the data visually Id be asking what types of assumptions do I have with the text and how do I write queries that would check against those assumptions Eg do the names have any trailing or leading space Is the naming convention for the error always a concatenation of the ID at the beginning or can the error show as First Name and then ID

Depending on how big your testing dataset is and who you are speaking to the thought process can be scaled up or down accordingly",0
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Hi Alex 

There is an issue in Senior Citizen Discount moderate SQL question The task says If a customer is 55 or above they qualify  this should be meaning  condition But it is not accepted as correct by the system I get your solution is correct only if I change to  which contradicts the task",0
fT-8mRf_-Hk,This is great Im taking the free Harvard SQL course online and seeing that these queries are mediumdifficulty is encouraging to me everything made sense and is very straightforward I really look forward to learning more SQL and getting into this industry,1
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Thanks for the website Alex One thing I would say is after doing medium SQL questions on websites such as stratascratch the ones on analyst builder are much easier Ive only been doing SQL a couple months and can get a majority of the medium questions correct on your website but fail to get most of them on other websites If Im applying to entry level DA and DS roles should I be ok if I can answer the medium questions on analyst builder,0
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Ive shared your channel with so many Alex so good I am an old lady now lol but thinking of documenting my journey of learning SQL and seeing where it takes me   Maybe inspire some Gen Xers,1

fT-8mRf_-Hk,Best thing i learn to write down what we need to do in query,1
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Great content Your presentation setup and communication skills are superb One minor suggestion is to be mindful of formatting best practices eg each column name on the next line preceeded by its separator comma   
I just unraveled a spaghetti noodle factory of selftaught SQL and the poor formatting added a lot of time   Reading code that is consistently formatted speeds up an analysts work and following formatting best practices is a sign of your professionalism in an interview",1

ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Great video One thing I would add is that not all interviewees will get a chance to live code as part of their interview process some will only send this question to you as a takehome The expectation then is to send back the query unless the questions explicitly ask you to elaborate more on your thought process In this basic query though the comments should suffice in succinctly conveying the thought process

K0-8G3DgjA4,"I changed my career started in 6 months Though I think I was lucky 

I went through an intense one month bootcamp SQL powerBI Python This gave me starting skills and knowledge what should I still need to learn Then found another course online which I still am trying to finish 
Job hunting was long enough I had some consultations with specialist in that which lead me to create a better resume and gave me more knowledge about LinkedIn 

Whilst I found my job online not on LinkedIN therefore I advise to find other job hunting resources not only using LinkedIN 

Now I am using python mostly Therefore I understand that I should try to learn more about SQL and excel I was thinking that you are born with skills in excel but experience shows different  

My advice in this journey is be ready allocate your financial resources Think about your timing check the job market try to find tendencies when the recruites post more jobs that you want 
Never stop learning",1

I wanted to ask you if we want to start preparing for a data analyst role from scratch can we still do your data analyst bootcamp in the order of your videos

That is what you teach in your YouTube data analyst bootcamp can we also learn it within Analyst Builder in a certain order

Your bootcamp with the 2023 content looks very comprehensive to get started Does this bootcamp have exercises to practice like Analyst Builder Or can we complement the data analyst bootcamp with Analyst Builder

Im asking so I dont get sidetracked

Thank you very much Alex

you have done a tremendous job

qxj3dx0c7RM,Hello Alex from Ethiopia Africa,0
qxj3dx0c7RM,"Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the CareerFoundry webinar on mistakes to avoid when searching for a data analytics job

Introduction

 William from CareerFoundry welcomes attendees to a webinar on career mistakes and planning a QA session
 The topic is avoiding mistakes in a data analytics job search covered in a video by Alex the Analyst 
 Alex is a CEO and consultant with extensive global work experience 

Mistake 1  Not Networking Enough

 Networking uncovers unadvertised opportunities and longterm connections
 Can validate skills gain advice and showcase abilities to industry professionals  
 Critical for mentorship prospects career growth especially early on

Mistake 2  Using a Generic Resume

 Tailor resumes to each application  match skills to role needs 
 Avoid spraying resume everywhere regardless of fit
 Customizing gets higher applicationtointerview conversion  

Mistake 3  No Portfolio Projects  

 Portfolios verify and demonstrate resume skills  
 Provide interview talking points on process and insights
 SQL scripts alone are good but full projects are better 

Mistake 4  Limited Company Research
 Learn about the companys data and business model
 Helps conversationally and tailoring responses during interviews
 Ask questions at the end to show initiative 

Mistake 5  Not Checking Company Culture  
 Research culture and employee satisfaction beyond the interview 
 One company portrayed positive culture but had terrible reviews  

Mistake 6  Accepting the Wrong Job
 Ensure alignment with position responsibilities 
 Consider worklife balance commute etc in decision making

Mistake 7  Isolating Yourself 

 Leverage networking platforms like LinkedIn to connect
 Be selective with recruiters due to risk of fake companies
 Recruiters simplify the job search process 

Additional Tips

 Blend hard and soft skills  both critical to get hired
 Show transferable skills from other industries  
 Persistently apply leveraging all resources as a new grad
 AI enables vs replaces data analytics jobs  learn alongside 
 Continue developing core data skills that remain indemand
 Prepare thoroughly for an active hiring period in 2024",0

zgYqUP_PhQo,"0000   Group By in MySQL groups rows with the same values in specified columns and allows running aggregate functions on them
 0213  Aggregate functions like AVG MAX MIN and COUNT can be used with Group By to calculate statistics for grouped rows
 0551  Order By sorts the result set in ascending or descending order based on specified columns
 0740  Multiple columns can be used for sorting with Order By allowing hierarchical sorting based on specified column order

MARn_mssG4A,Hi Alex I have a question about 517 in the query you have written  AND gender  male Before running this query I have tried to guess the result and thought that it will be no output because gender values starts with capital letter and when we write gender  male it must not find such a suitable value My question is that does mysql behave caseinsensitive in these cases,1
MARn_mssG4A,If anyone wants to know why theres a row containing the null value well its not an actual row in the database Its a placeholder row added by MySQL Workbench for manual data entry you will notice  you can click on it and type values if you are in result grid view,0

TGAUZQJaQbQ,Garbage tool used by people who know no better Data limitations prone to frequent crashes clunky  and alltogether a pox on our society,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Just came here to find out if I hate excel for the right reasons,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel is just bullahiy horseshit shititsel hope it so,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Cant handle thousands of rows   Yeah thats  called a database  not Excel Excel  is for  modelling and sensitivity analysis   If you are trying to stuff 10000 rows in a spreadsheet   Well then    Try Access it comes with the suite Excel comes with VBA and you can automate EVERYTHING  like most users they just scratch the surface  Excel is a great tool if you learn how to use it but it is not a database  Never advertised as one Excel has a rich graphing capability but not on a par with Power BI  nor is it as fast,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel is absolutely trash for simple data analysis  I spent almost 30 minutes troubleshooting and searching the internet trying to display a simple linear regression equation  y  mx  b from a 2  variable chart with about 20 data points  I never figured it out This is one of the most BASIC simplest things you could look for in statistics  Huge fail,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,For Junior data Analyst which would be better to use Excel or Google Sheets,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Wait is excel cannot shared data real time Because I did use it before,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I work at a major Bank where I am the sole DA for a non technical team Our monthly transaction details contains almost 1 million lines of data Doing any filtering pivot or lookups will crash the damn thing Now imagine doing it for a 1224 month ask,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,In comparison I will be more prefer Google Sheet first of all it is cloudbased i do not need to worry about forget to save problem and the formula i feel that could more functionable than excel for example UNIQUE,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Weirdly when dealing with data sets exceeding 300000 rows  its easier to take the data into the VB Editor using variant arrays and write back rows where a column contains a value rather than apply filters  Unless youre transforming your data within the VB editor or via powerquery Excel doesnt handle large data well It seems to me that Microsoft intend you to handle large datasets with more advanced tools

I agree that version control is less than ideal

Now Excel online and OneDrive are being used to work on the same spreadsheets simultaneously  I believe Excel can actually do what Google Sheets can doworks for me anyway

I dont think excel is designed for advanced data visualisation however  now theyre integrating some Python so who knows what theyre planning Perhaps some kind of AI  Excel integration to help automate data visualisation 

Whilst general programming languages offer perhaps a great variety of things to automate VB and VBA can automate quite a lot both within excel in windows  and other Microsoft products 

The question is why you would learn enough VBA or VB to develop a broader ability to automate You would do so only if your job required it I think most people learning to program are going to be aiming at the future jobs markets AI machine learning Data analysis  website design and virtual realityfilmvideo gaming applications 

However  whats noticable is that even very large corporations still heavily utilise excel Often these companies lockdown their machines so most users can use VBA but not Python I think thats the main reason VBA programmers havent abandoned VBA altogether in favour of Python",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,If you know how to use classes arrays find function dictionaries you are really fast in VBAExcel However you can run SQL in VBAExcel if you like BTW using a powerful interface in VBA you can create dynamic SQL queries Just selecting items from dynamically created lists based on tables you can create SQL queries as flexible as you wish without typing the SQL query However youll need to generate the SQL string query in VBA based on your rules,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I can extract 25k records out of 1 million records in 25 seconds using VBA Just wonder if is slow Also extract hundreds of files names build an array from tens of thousands based on multiple key words searches in fractions of a second Is this slow,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Excel is certainly the model of a lovehate relationship 
Its super useful for very basic reporting or making PivotTable but the minute you start using Power Query or importing data the loadingrefresh times can get out of hand and then people who want that report do not understand how to use it Seems like there should be a merger between PBI and Excel that brings the best of both together for those reports that require drill down and some visualizations when specifying certain metrics or criteria need to be specified I deal with operations and logistics so maybe my use cases are unique but those are my gripes LOL",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Alex can you help give us tutorials on Azure Data Studio,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Lots of talk based on 10 years ago Excel,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Im just learning Excel and Ive been getting into all the different things it can do  Now I am interested in becoming a data analysts and from what other data analysts have said from other videos I have seen say Excel is a good place to start for a foundation and then move on from there like learning Sql and other data base languages  Saw one of your videos on Sql  Very interesting,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel with sharepoint seems to work for version control and realtime usage,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I just feel like things go so much quicker with SQL or Python With Excel I feel like I have so many small steps that I have to get in order to get things done However on the flip side I LOVE the visual aspect of Excel,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel is still the best tool to quick check something  or to write a complex query download the data and send a Pivot as a quick and dirty solution to adhoc request No matter how big the company is or tools it uses there will always be 1 board member or colleague that will ask you can i get it in xlxl format please  So yes it does have a limitation however this tool wont be going anywhere and what i would even suggest is learn excel to be at least  intermediate user your life as a Data Analyst or we Data position you will have will be easier,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Any comments on PowerBI software Does Data Analysts love them,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"3D stacked pie chart 

Edit wait tell me those dont exist please",0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I still consider Power Query in excel  one of the best ETL tools for data transformation,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Haha ok ive probably been using excel longer than youve been doing addition  excel is fantastic for appropriate use cases    but its not good for everything  btw the visuals in excel back in the day were about the best you could generally find,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,When Indid not know about the existenxe of other tools I did an analysis on Excel with a fine temporal resolution data 15 mins and the data is for 5 years Excel crashed severally It boggles my mind that Microsoft is interoperating with Python yet this limitation of Excel has not been improved upon Is it a policy thing or what Anyway are putting this on LinkedIn  I would love to see David Langets reaction to this video In any event enpirically Excel is still valued in the Data Industry I am even going to use it now including its data visualization  Thanks for sharing your thoughts,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,UmmmI guess you never heard of Excel Online Power Automate Power Query Power Bi and Macroshuh,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,However most companies are still looking for Excel skills for data analytics,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,i hate excel with a passion,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,What if you open this excel file with pandas in Jupiter notebook,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Alex kindly make a video on how sql is benefited for HRs it will be big help,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I find myself making a sheet called raw data with all of the cleaning and wrangling being done with a copy of the data in a different sheet,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hey alex let me know how sql  benefits HR Mng,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hello sir make a video on realtime change in data automatically change in dashboard,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,That pun was intended,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I used Excel when is already filtered in Sql and used tableau or power bi for visualization,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I am forced to use Excel daily because clients dont know how to use other data tools nor can I use OneDrive due to sensitive information,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Found it already  thank youuu,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hi Alex please I just came across your videos not long ago and I love it thank you so much for doing this Im new to this career just about starting Please do you have an introduction to Excel Cos I just saw Conditional formatting Charts Cleaning data and full project in Excel in your channel,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I dislike it so much I cant get myself to really learn it,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Theyre trying to solve some of this with the python for excel functionality Add in power query and you might have something cool to work with If your arm is twisted of course,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Python is coming to Excel I think Excel is cool again,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Power query bro,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Ever heard of excel addins like power pivot and power query  Use those if you need to work with big data also if you need more visualizations you now have python in excel,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,While I agree with your comments on large data handling and visualizations as someone who has used excel for over 15 years and attribute my strength in it as the primary contributing factor to the progression in my career I strongly disagree with your statement and sentiment of the people who really love Excel are the people who are just getting started in Excel  I still love Excel and would highly advise anyone getting into data analysis that you have to learn it  You also have to learn how to summarize data in SQL and other tools first so you dont have every row in Excel filled inthe tool was not designed to be used this way no matter how many rowscolumns Microsoft put in it  Dont hate it learn it and learn it well  You WILL stand out in a good way if you do,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Reason 3  it does allow for collaborative work if you save it on a Teams channel Works relatively OK,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Didnt even mention Python in Excel especially around improving data viz capabilities In terms of automation whilst you cant access your local machine currently  Im sure it wont be long before Python in Excel allows for this,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Why is everyone talking about automation in terms of VBA and not in Power QueryPower Pivot 
As far as I know Microsoft themselves stopped supporting VBA 
And yeah I agree about Data Viz part but in terms of data transformations you can literally do the same stuff you can in Pandas
Also you are saying that Excel freezes with big amounts of data  well because you are cooking it wrong Load it into data model and use Power Pivot to display the aggregations you want You dont view the whole dataframe in Python do you  
What will happen with Python if you decide to view the whole dataframe of lets say 1M rows and 2030 columns by removing the limitation of dataframe display It will either crash your Jupyter notebook or take forever to load
I mean I dont use Excel much but it can handle a lot more if you know how to use it and sometimes be a fastermore convenient solution than one in PythonR",0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Why doesnt everyone just use Google sheets,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,to your second point about the lack of version control if you add  a data connection to all the data tables in your excel file and do the data transformations in power query you actually have pretty good version control in the power query module inside of excel,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,If you are analysing large quantities of data you need a tool that can work with the data in an organised way  MS Access springs to mind  Excel is a problem in that the formulas are too easily changed one by one    It is hard to check that your spreadsheet works as you intend  With a database you use sql to manipulate data as far as possible  Excel to deal simply with relatively small amounts of data and present it,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I love Excel so much I was stunned by how versatile it is when I was learning it at first Havent used it for a while though I just use SQL and Python more,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Data analyst here I feel you are unfair regarding automation I feel that there are libraries and tools to help you automate with excel I have found I can automate pretty much everything I need to do with excel VBA Although it is often easier with pythonpandas,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I also hate Excel but reason 3 and 4 are wrong There is a collaborative side to it with the subscription and it now supports Python,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,My son feels the same He handles gigabytes of data in his job in telecoms and he gets super stressed with its data limitations While he can do queries from Redshift clients still want excel,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,You are absolutely correct  Excels small learning curve makes it a favorite but by no means is Excel a one size fits all tool  I have seen billiondollar companies being run on Excel and the accounting dept drowning in spreadsheets crazy,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I get fairly large data pulls at my work and for some reason security they will only write them in encrypted xlsx files that end up being several GB in size This leads to my question  do you do much with xlwings for Python Ive used this library to write macros and extract data from excel and I very much prefer it to VBA,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Death to spreadsheets was part of my work email signature at some point I got told off a bit so in retaliation I upgraded it to Death to Excel 

Fortunately I get away with a lot of stuff",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Get a Mac Version control is built right into the OS,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Fax lol,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Hey Alex I definitely dont hate excel I understand your points but I disagree 

1 large data size yes this is a fair point above 1 million rows  it becomes pretty unusable There are potential workarounds though with tools like powerquery but yes I agree at this point it makes sense to use a different tool or excel combined with some other tools like Python dataframes

2 Version control so this is part of google sheets For excel files if saved in share point or onedrive you can do that 

3 again collaboration is possible if you use excel online with share point or onedrive

4 VBA I agree their are limitations but it still is a powerful tool I have made UI games Monte Carlo simulations and many powerful automations with VBA

5 I think excels data visualization is great for what is needed What you mentioned is basically a big part of why power bi exists

Anyway imo excel is amazing people should get better at Excel and it should be part of any data analysts skillset Like anything its a tool that works best combined with Python power query SQL and powerbi knowledge",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Didja consider keeping your source data in a separate file just in case something went wrong in Excel
Thats what we learned in the old days Do your own damned version control
They like to tell you Excel can do everything but obviously it cant
Did they ever fix that rounding error that raised such a stink around the turn of the millennium
You mentioned Google Sheets There ARE alternate spreadsheet tools out there some that will do things Excel just cant But how many different tools do you want to have to learn
Yeah its the lingua franca out there like Python is But that does NOT mean theyre the best available tools especially for a particular job Say I hear you can now script Excel with Python Do you think that will really help",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,hahahaha Filters the first thing that popped into  my mind,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Those are all good points I havent had the version problem luckily  Most people I know love it because they dont do anything highly complicated,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Yeah people who only use things like Excel and PowerB are insane R is king for data analytics Some specific stuff Python is better for but R is really just the meat and bones of  analysis and visualisation,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Maybe its just a problem Ive had but I cannot seem to get excel to do a simple count distinct in a pivot table either,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Your points have merit but as a ExcelMicrosoft fan boy I have to disagree But that is just me,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Data limitation and performance issues  hear hear,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,As we say in England horses for courses Excel is great for some tasks not so great for others Ive been working with companies ranging from 5 employees right up to 30000 employees The only thing common between them was that every single person had access to Excel Its everywhere and that alone makes it invaluable If you only work in a techdata department great Use python Sql wahtever you want and whatever is available As soon as you have to work with nondata people youre screwed Chances are they are still going to be somewhat familiar with Excel If they need more than a simple dashboard thats the way to go,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I really bust out laughing  I can relate a lot to the first reason  the excel will take hours to open and will just crash Power Bi my new lover,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I am one of the people who dislike Excel,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Youre making this with Excel on personal level XD,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"So I bought a local  Brazilian program to become a Data Scientist and it doesnt really teach Excel  they go straight to Python so why bother

The fact of my first dashboard ever was done on Streamlit was cool and all but I decided to learn Power BI on my own and it felt like a burden sometimes Then a lot of job descriptions ask for Excel  and it looks worse than Power BI I get it if you dont know how to SQLPython and the dataset is minimal it works However Im either Google Sheets online collab works and its free enough or PythonSQL 

People are asking Rocket Science questions on interviews for a junior position  if the industry is that demanding they should have dropped Excel a long time ago

But thats not the world we live in Every single beginner on data should start on ExcelPower BI to slap it on the resume before knowing better yes including Data Science on which Excel and Power BI dont really belong  except they do on job requirements Because learning them after you know better is mildly painful 

Tldr Most other things are Python results but bad Except R but we dont talk about R",0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel freezes when you have to analyse a whole bunch of data set,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,A couple of the downfalls you describe are due to the fact that Microsoft wants you to use their infrastructure for example online collaboration is possible via Sharepoint This gives you a very simple version control as well Automation should become better with the intruction of Python,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I met an experienced wannabe making claims that excel is the best tool for analytics me and my little knowledge literally laughed my ass off he no longer speaks to me these days,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Therapeutic indeed,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I love it when it just randomly crashes and closes a few xlsx files at once without any notice Well not that randomly as it happens under heavy use,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,ALSO i really hate the formulas syntaxM for life heuehueheu,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I was just saying how much I hated Excel the other day Who needs Excel anyway when you have Python and SQL,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Microsoft will not develop Excel more than their other products like Power bi If u do want larger data set to be analysed for rationality than pay more  go for Power bi,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Small chargers from Microsoft,-1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"You are right Excel is no less than an anxiety and stress in such contexts
 In your opinion what is the alternative if we are dealing with big data sets and that we need to avoid the stress and frustration  from excel in such scenariosthe reasons you have mentioned in the video should we use Python or any other tool",0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I love excel but for accounting and not with data analysis,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Im waiting for excel with python  first thing I will install pandas and polars,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I hate what Excel does to data files So many times someone sends me a data file to load into a database and leading zeroes are dropped from zip codes columns are misaligned or other odd issuesthis happens especially when people open a csv directly into Excel save it then pass it along to be loaded into a database,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I started my data analysis journey learning R I never used excel in the degree I am in now I did the google data analysis cert and used sheets and excel both I was excited to learn due to most jobs saying they want you to know it However I just went back to using R for almost everything because its just so much better,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I once rejected a job offer because  they were using only Excel FOR DATA VISUALIZATION,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"While I agree with your statements on general i still love excel as it was the start of my passion with data 
Excel will do all the jobs when your data is relatively small AND your using power query and data models Less than 1 million rows easily and up to 2 millions with some difficulty If your data is more use other solutions

The other point is that all business world are still depending on it so its basic skill that you need",0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"In all fairness to Excel it was never designed for this level of data or type of activity If you could start from scratch how would you redesign it

Heres what Id do
1 Integrate local python  R usage as well as allowing it to execute the code remotely in the cloud
2 Version control
3 Online colab instead of purely local Google Sheets
4 Better visualization builder
5 Better handling of Big Data all hail the Big Data
6 Kill VBA Just let it die
7 Better automation",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Whatever analysis I do my colleagues ask me eventually to send an Excel file,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hello Alex Can you make a video on entry level remote data analyst jobs It would help a lot,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,wps better sometimes we get data from sql and clean it through wps,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,My love for excel is broken now XD hope you give us better alternatives to excel in other video,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,thats really interesting you struggled with the processes you can complete to automate with VBA i was tasked to do a lot of VBA automation in my first role and the only time i ran into issues was when externalinternal data changed formatting etc,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"This is interesting Im starting in data analytics and Ive had this idea that I should use Excel since its an industry standard I used it back in the days when Google Sheets didnt exist but eventually switched over Google Sheets because its free the interface is much nicer and has plenty to offer for analytics Trying out Excel now feels like a step back especially in terms of UI
Maybe you should do a head to head Google Sheets vs Excel video",1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hi Alex cool video but for collaboration u can upload ur files to one drive and share file with others,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,sure I use sql in R  where initially i used excel,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,realy,0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"My supervisor asked me a few minutes ago why I do most of analysis in SQL and I was wondering Isnt it obvious Its smoother faster and less likely to make mistakes

Then I come on YouTube and I see this video Im not alone",0
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I love excel its straight forward app,1
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I do like the ease of use with excel with small data sets,-1

QzLz-W29Tww,Hey Alex I started my channel about a year and a half ago Thanks for this video,0
QzLz-W29Tww,What I hated the most when I was starting on my main channel was that I had better content and videos generally than most of the bigger youtubers but i just couldnt move from a dead point Here is my advice for beginners invest couple of dollars in Fame ster and save yourself from stressing I was sceptic and scared for may channel but it is completely safe Cheers,1
QzLz-W29Tww,"Ive just finished watching your video on starting a datafocused YouTube channel and I felt compelled to reach out and express my gratitude for the insights youve shared As someone who has been contemplating the idea of launching a similar channel your advice and guidance have proven to be invaluable

Your approach to breaking down the process into digestible steps was particularly impactful You didnt merely suggest starting a channel but instead provided practical guidance on identifying a niche crafting engaging content and effective methods of promoting a channel Your honesty when discussing the challenges one might face such as finding motivation and overcoming the fear of exposure was truly appreciated

Your emphasis on authenticity resonated deeply with me Instead of advocating for mimicry of successful channels you champion the idea of discovering our own unique voice and style In my opinion this authenticity is the key ingredient in creating a distinctive and captivating channel

One enlightening point you made was about the importance of having a content plan I agree that a clear roadmap for the channel not only fuels motivation but also ensures the consistency and relevance of the content This is something Im keen to incorporate into my own strategy

In conclusion your video has provided the impetus I needed to kickstart my own data YouTube channel Your evident passion and enthusiasm for your work are infectious and inspiring Thank you Alex for generously sharing your knowledge and experiences with us Your video has not only equipped me with valuable techniques and strategies but has also reignited my motivation to embark on this exciting journey",1
QzLz-W29Tww,Hey Alex just wanted to give you a huge shout for imparting me knowledge and confidence to go and build my own tableau portfolio and get employed You are doing a commendable job Keep on doing the good deed and all the best for future,1
QzLz-W29Tww,Thank you Alex for the excellent advice Pretty inspiring I just started my channel weeks ago Sometimes I thought I knew something well but it turned out I didnt Teaching is really a great way of learning,1
QzLz-W29Tww,It will be really great if you make a video on technical interviews for an entry level data analyst such as what questions are generally asked and a summary regarding the same Thanks,1
QzLz-W29Tww,Once you decided that youre more of youtuber than data analyst the content value of this channel is decreasing,1
QzLz-W29Tww,Not relevant to this post but I cant access the discord platform on analyst builder Its saying the address is invalid Im also having trouble importing the world life expectancy data to MySQL It imports perfectly to Excel but only imports 25 of the data to Mysql Any suggestions,1
QzLz-W29Tww,"Im starting one called Datagnolo in Italian im not hoping to get a lot of views due Italy has only 60 million people so not many of those will be interested in my content But I want to do it to practice my data analysis skills and Italian skills

I did something similar 4 years ago i started a YouTube channel talking about YouTube and YouTube management in English and helped a lot to improve my English skills I even got clients as a YouTube manager  

So if youre reading this message and youre thinking to start a YouTube channel dont overthink it but dont do it for the views or subscribers do it for some reason its more important to you than external approval",0
QzLz-W29Tww,"Exactly the same reasons for starting a channel as me 

I needed a way to force learning but learning in a way you know enough to teach some one basically a form of the Feynman technique and document what I learn  create so I have it as a reminder but also giving back to the data community as I have learnt so much from long running data YouTubers

Feels great to give back   One thing I would add is for anyone starting youtube it takes time to grow so just enjoy the journey and dont let the early low subs and views get you down Just keep posting and see if its something you enjoy first and then decide if you want to do as just a hobby part time or full time so you dont burn out",1
QzLz-W29Tww,Hey Alex can you do a tutorial about Credit Risk Analysis or maybe a tutorial on forecasting,0
QzLz-W29Tww,Please make a video on IBM spss,0
QzLz-W29Tww,Candid and helpful as always You share insights and information without any material gain from the viewers You remind me of Dr Eric Berg who shares medical information without any material gain and is ever candid to his audience,1
QzLz-W29Tww,Great tips  I like that you provide free options  I watched another youtuber based in the Netherlands and she had really expensive equipment  She is also very upbeat like you  But because of the equipment I thought maybe I should save up for those before I start  Thankfully this came out and I saw costfree options  Well not entirely freeyoutube content creation will still cost time away from other priorities,1
QzLz-W29Tww,Thanks for sharing Your videos were such an inspiration to start my TikTok page,0
QzLz-W29Tww,Immediately i saw this video my heart really skipped I felt like this video is really for me,1
QzLz-W29Tww,I think I may do this Thanks Alex,1
QzLz-W29Tww,What I hated the most when I was starting on my main channel was that I had better content and videos generally than most of the bigger youtubers but i just couldnt couldnt get recognized by many people Here is my advice for beginners no matter what kind of content you have  invest couple of dollars in Fame Ster Social and save yourself from stressing,1
QzLz-W29Tww,"Hello Alex love your videos

Ive been surfing the internet to gather information about the job role of a data analyst I have found that DAs are required to interact with stakeholders on the businessoperationsfinance side of the company and for this having domain knowledge is preferred in addition to technical skills

Could you please make a video about different domains that DAs can choose to get into and also suggest some resources to learn about those domains so that we can be job ready

Many thanks",1
QzLz-W29Tww,This is how you invent the wheel without reinventing the wheel Infinite loop Awesome,1
QzLz-W29Tww,Thank you for this Alex Im considering starting a YouTube channel because I become extremely nervous when speaking in front of more than two or three people to the point where I freeze up I hope that I can gain a bit of confidence by speaking to the camera and sharing it with the world,1

aofB2t5o2ao,Is this yet another video of upworker thinking he is a consultant or what  You can be amazing engineer analyst or whatever the key is branding attracting and closing clients If you do that you do not even need to be a good engineer or analyst or consultant you can hire someone else So all this I am I am is absolute garbage You are whatever platforms or your clients make out of you unless you can command something And there are zillions of people who can do great analytics and all of them think they are super duper heros,1

aofB2t5o2ao,"3400 even with contracts ive had 6 not pay
each time you think you have learnt your lesson  you know they have the money bc after 2 clients decided to skip out going fwd i asked potential clients to prove that they could pay 
and then you think is it a hassle to bring them to small claims court  and then you decide to just write it off bc the startup community is small and if others knew that you would make it a big deal to go after those that owe you for work done then i was afraid of my name being smeared

but my due diligence is warning a lot of consultantsfreelancers",-1

If I may add a suggestion If you dont already have it on your list can you add a placement test so that people can see what they already know and where their holes in education is It can take that information to suggest brushing up on xyz skill or suggest they start with beginner intermediate or advanced level based on how your levels are broken up in the courses",1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hey Alex 

I just wanted to start by saying I honestly cant wait for this site I have been waking up and checking my emails every day waiting for this beta lol Second I just finished this video and I had a question on the pricing so if we were to purchase the lifetime bundle we would have access to those four courses that you currently have and any future courses that you add Does this also include the premium questions so all of the questions that we saw in this video and any future questions I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question I just want to make sure I understand it correctly before I purchase it  once it comes out of course  Thank you in advance for your response and thank you for all the hard work you put in to teach us",1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Sick  Im gonna buy the lifetime Honestly youve done so much to help n support all of us so I def want to support you n the team,0
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Alex this is really amazing I cant thank you enough and I really appreciate your dedication and kindness to always sharing what you have learned with us so that we can get into the clear and right path best of luck for you and your team,1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Congratulations for all your hardwork and Thank you Alex for creating courses for people who wish to land the data analytics field as me Your Analyst Builder platform is absolutely amazing and making prices affordable which really have impact in this expensive world I believe it is available to purchase worldwide as I am from the UK I followed most of your excellent courses on YouTube for awhile by now Im hoping to land a data analyst job at one day with the worries of being in my mid 35th from switching careers and having low selfesteem All the courses are extremely helpful straightforward and knowledgeable Please keep up the hard work Alex,1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Best of luck Alex Im definitely going to check it out BTW the platform looks amazing,1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Unless Ive misunderstood this sounds like I could pick a SQL query I can answer and use it to myself how to replicate in python

If so game changer",-1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,love how excited you are and your content has been helpful but whats the difference between analyst builder and hackkerank sincerely theres a burn out of people frustrated from doing all these and not getting a job so apart from certificates are there any guarantees to having an advantage over others eg vouchers for certifications or recommendations i dont know if you get what i mean cant wait for the launch and congratulations,0
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Outstanding vision alex but I personally think you might have to be competitive about the course pricing to udemy,1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Please bro Please make it affordable,0
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Looks great Alex Cant wait to check it out,1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Im excited to use this as someone who is already a data analyst I need more experience with SQL and Python,1
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Im doing your analyst vids on YT but Im still excited to get into Analyst Builder,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,I have completed the data analytics course from your videos  But I didnt do any projects  I need to prepare more and complete projects and I hope I will land a job at the end of this year thank you so much Alex  Your are the best teacher,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,I need help with SQL Python  and Tableau so badim so lost and was just layed off,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,I work as a Data Analyst in the oil and gas sector I primarily use Excel and SQL My worry is that my educational background is in Educational Technology and Ill have trouble getting an offer in tech as they often require a degree in Engineering CS or maths But I know R in addition to Excel  SQL I also know advance statistics such multilevel modelling Given these would I have trouble working in tech as a DS,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,It still makes me laugh how many people are shocked and awed when i use a simple vlookup to do a job in a few seconds that they say they spend hours on Then proceed to not learn it at all,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,The problrm is that even if you are not going to use those most of even entry level and junior jobs expects you to have all of those,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,Part 2,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,But what if you can already use python or Rstudio to go through data Will the companies have anything against it,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,This is so true I literally just started working as a Data Analyst and the public school I work for has just SQL and MS Report Builder not the snappiest of response times for queries and reportbuilding compared to my previous Corporat job as a FrontEnd Dev but I am happy to flex my brain in a crunchier way that I am enjoying so much better Hopefully next role will be at a fancier company with shiny new tools but this is awesome for starting my Tech Career pivot during a rough economy,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,Agree If you are a data analyst you might tap into the data source yourself using SQL or someone else will make a csv avaliable for you Even if you use Python for data cleansing ultimately your internal client will use Excel so you need to know it well enough to present the results in a way they will understand and be able to perform ad hoc analysis on the fly,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,And yet I still cant get a job in data analytics because Im defined by my employment history and recruiters and hiring managers ignore the certifications and education,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,Yes So glad you mentioned this,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,"Hi Alex
I am big fan of your videos on YouTube
I am from Bharat",0
LaRXtE4OG9A,Nice,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,Meanwhile if you look at junior data analyst vacancy in Indonesia youll find out that almost all of them require Python which is ridiculous,-1
LaRXtE4OG9A,Thank you for saying this There is a misconception out there that the more tools you know the better analyst you are Which is not true at all,1
LaRXtE4OG9A,What if i am using Bigquery and google sheets,0
LaRXtE4OG9A,I try to find you on LinkedIn but I cant  please share you Id,0

xuyKzpJ2SaY,The issue with SAS is that its a siloed solution sure you can connect a db but thats about it If you want to build anything beyond a simple report or model used within the sas platform youre SOL,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,For those who  Statistics Data Analytics etc just learn that SAS R or Python are mere tools If youve got the impression that youll get to choose which tool youll use at your workplace youre in for a big surprise  In my case Ive used SAS for 10 years in the healthcare industry For the past 23 years weve managed to change most of our codebase to R by management decision and make some 7 figures cost cuts And yes GitHub Copilot helped a lot The things Im able to do with the tidyverse packages in R compared with the effort put in with SAS in the past Out of nostalgia I follow the SAS channels on YT hoping that some miraculously things would happen Then Im reminded of MACROS and the DATA step and sadness sets in Nonetheless the fresh pool of talents coming from academia havent heard of SAS Theres a lot of effort put into by SAS towards machine learning in recent years Youre better off with Python and Knime if you want to go in that direction and save some money I wouldnt bet against SAS either This could become a niche segment very fast Just look at at the COBOL language in banking industry,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,How do people think about the need of learning SAS if you already know python,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,SAS hasnt stood for Statistical Analysis System for many years,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,SASing,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Ive been in my current role for a little over a year this is my first healthcare analyst role using SAS  I feel that we use SAS Enterprise Guide very little for statistical purposes and more for ETL from several different data sources as our primary team database and for automated scheduled reporting with extracts to shared locations and emailed attachments Excel PDF and embedded email body reports similar to how I used to use  Microsofts SSRS in my previous teams  For dashboards we push data out to Tableau to build them there,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Thanks for your sharing on your thought on SAS Explore event sound like a good experience,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Sir make a video on statistics for data analysis,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,I THINK YOU SHOULD CREATE A SINGLE PROJECT WHICH INVOLVES ALL TOOLS LIKE PYTHON  SQL TABLEAU IT WILL HELP US A LOT,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,AN EXEC AT SAS HELPED WIRETAP MY COMPUTERS TO STEAL MY ASSETS WITH USING WEB WATCHERS AND AWARENESS TECHNOLOGIES WHO VIOLATE THE FEDERAL WIRETAP APP STALKING MYSELF AND CHILDREN THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND THOSE INVADING PRIVACY ARRESTED AND PLACED IN FEDERAL PRISON THE CEO RUNNING CHILDRENSORGS AND COS IS VERY CONCERNING,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"Hey Alex Good morning and Thank you for all you ressources Because youre my raw model in data analysis today I commit myself to finish the Coursera data analysis in 3 months So on the 28 December I Will be done If not so thats means that Im not a recommended person in that field

Thanks a lot",1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Trading took half a year of my life Im just investing in Cannafarm ltd today and getting daily returns,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Im a biostatistician and an R user but I joined academia recently they use SAS with big data I tried using R and it crashed I think SAS is capable of what R isnt capable of But I dont know if it can beat Python I would rather not use SAS because it is pain to learn,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,SAS is amazing  Amazing people  Amazing certificatons  it is so awesome to hear your opinion is starting to align with what has been one of the major focuses in my current and previous experiences  check out their certifications They are also constantly improving on existing features  Sas on Demand is really easy to jump into and get started learning Happy coding,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Hey Alex thanks for sharing this with us A SQL question for you please is there a SQL certificate that makes me stand out from the crowd Not an administrative certificate but a database certificate that will make my resume noticeable along with my computer science degree Thanks your friend from Kansas City,1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,If i must know SASi will can become a data analyst SIR,0
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"The greatest thing about SAS is you can do a huge amount of tasks in SQL Ive missed SAS because of this when using eg Pandas in Python and would look for packages like sqldf so I could do work in SQL Also some of its built in procedures are extremely powerful and more advanced than in Python Proc Compare being the biggest example in my mind

In one of its IDEs Enterprise Guide theres also a fantastic function called Query Builder which lets you build SQL queries very quickly by clicking and dragging It also has a nice very straightforward functionality to link scripts together in a workflow like Airflow but much simpler

One downside of SAS is for some reason teams Ive worked on using it atleast in banking have been skimpy on proper version controlling  and this has caused a lot of issues and lack of trust One reason is that if you embed a script in Enterprise Guide it cant be accessed by Git",1
xuyKzpJ2SaY,SAS is the main tool we use at my work I was a bit skeptical going in but Im still surprised by what you can do with it,0

bxIF9X9k2IE,Hey would 2 excel projects 2 SQL projects 2 powerBI projects and 2 projects using all of the above skills be enough for a portfolio,0
bxIF9X9k2IE,Thanks for your continuous uploads One content suggestion for you assume that you are going to start a new job while your data analysis skill is topnotch the first challenge is always about understanding the business at first in such case what will be your plan to understand them I hope we can see a content from you on this matter,1
bxIF9X9k2IE,Hello Alex thank you for your explanation Help us a lot especially for departments where DA  DS stands together in the same place I have a favor could you mind describe difference DA  BI Business Intelligence Its quite confusing especially on startup company because both of them shall deals with adhoc request create dashboard and reports,0
bxIF9X9k2IE,Unfortunately a lot of companies are tying to to roll data science skills into data analyst roles Data Scientist hype is dying down as many companies do not have the infrastructure or use cases to support ML it so they end up doing mostly analyst work Companies that actually know what they are doing call the role ML engineer,0
bxIF9X9k2IE,you look like you like donut charts,0
bxIF9X9k2IE,Where do you categories Business Intelligence Analyst Data Analyst or Data Scientist,0
bxIF9X9k2IE,Alex can I ask you if Data Entry Analyst is also a Data Analyst I will be grateful for your answer Thank you so much,1
bxIF9X9k2IE,Good stuff Alex I feel like I am constantly having to readjust some of my stakeholders conceptions about what I am capable of doing as a data analyst I would love to to be able to build out predictive ML models and do time series forecasting but my current skillset is firmly in the analyst column vs scientist D I dont mind this either and both roles are super important in datadriven orgs,1
bxIF9X9k2IE,Great video you answered my question but I have one more difference for data analytics vs data analysis,1
bxIF9X9k2IE,All I want to know is how to get hired I have spent quite a good amount of time learning the skills for a data analyst role besides Azure and SPSS I have been looking for  an entry level job but its hard to find a job for a non experienced person  speaking in Indian context,1

z_xWpa88R0A,Excel has been a staple in my work in finance and accounting and is still so in data analytics Those who say Excel is not powerful have never learned the advanced functions that Excel can do Yes they can slow down with large data sets But if you can use your other programs to slice and dice your data sets into smaller tables Excel is a great tool to share that filtered data with your stakeholders,0
z_xWpa88R0A,So sir what about power bi is good or not for analyst,1
z_xWpa88R0A,Excel is very good and it can be slow when dealing with a big dataset,1
z_xWpa88R0A,Ok I will learn,1
z_xWpa88R0A,Staple,0
z_xWpa88R0A,Hi Alex I am having a problem with Excel and Github I uploaded an Excel file on Guthub and on downloading it from Excel it is no opening I need help,0
z_xWpa88R0A,Its horrible that spreadsheets are so widely used  They are inefficient studies show they tend to be riddled with mistakes  Excel is as outdated as using a fax maybe AI will be the death of Excel,-1
z_xWpa88R0A,"For sure Excel remain in the game not even now that you can run Python codes in Excel 

My work sits between a Data analyst role and Data Scientist role maybe that makes me a Data Science Analyst as mentioned by  recently

Several times I find myself preparing stakeholders reports in excelword",0
z_xWpa88R0A,I am now building some Power BI projects but does anyone know where to find live which gets updated databases to use I dont want to just use a csv file but want to build one with a live connection,1
z_xWpa88R0A,Explain Healthcare analysis,0
z_xWpa88R0A,Excel is the basic thing Its really not a tool one can choose not to learn because they want to be more technical You might want to be more technical and use R or python because statistics or sth So excel might not be your tool of choice but its the basics Personally I wont even bother with anyone hiding behind the excuse Im sorry Im too technical laaaazyyyy,0
z_xWpa88R0A,While practicing SQL in platfroms like hacker rankleetcode  I am unable to solve all problems MY Question is  Is practicing in hackerrank leetcode is required if we want to be a DATA ANALYST,-1
z_xWpa88R0A,Power query dominates,0
z_xWpa88R0A,Its pretty interesting that once you know one tool the others are easier I had some experience with SQL and started to learn Excel and it was easy to understand what was happening with stuff like VLOOKUP after already knowing about select statements and joins Im starting to learn Salesforce and while they call everything a different name than those other two tools the concepts are roughly the same,1
z_xWpa88R0A,Yeah we need to know excel sadly mostly to help the less technical but hearing python in excel is coming is cool,1
7PoZBuIUnEU,With a Physics degree one should  go for a business analyst or data analyst Can anyone guide,0
7PoZBuIUnEU,I wonder that what if a BA with DA skillsets Is that amazing,1
7PoZBuIUnEU,One thing that he didnt touch on is that Business Analyst has a wide range of field From health care to marketing to real estate to production and operations which I am working as a BA now to finance It depends on the company and your specific background No company would want an analyst with IT background to handle their financial document If anyone wants to become a BA pick your specific interest,0

Xkb6h3YXl_c,Im currently working on my MBA capstone project as part of my journey towards completing my MBA in data analytics Transitioning from a background in IT and marketing this degree has significantly aided me in securing a technical data analyst position where I utilize SQL and Python regularly However due to the accelerated nature of the program Ive noticed that my soft skills particularly in effective communication and presentation could use improvement Im seeking suggestions on how to enhance my ability to communicate and present complex data analytics statistics AI and ML concepts to both my team and business leaders Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated,0
Xkb6h3YXl_c,I absolutely agree that it is possible to develop your soft skills If you feel insecure because you are an introvert and have some degree of social anxiety I promise over the years that you will develop your own communication style and eventually you will learn that people will genuinely like you for who you are It takes time and not everyone will like you no matter what you do But you will become comfortable with who you are And maybe one day you will own it and create an entire brand around it Signed The Nerd Dad Extraordinaire  A Fellow Introvert,1
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Hey Alex I have been struggling with coming up with project ideas for my portfolio What do you recommend,0
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Have you done a video on what makes a good Data Analyst Resumes,1
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Hello Im new to this field with a BS in Sociology and will be starting my MS in Data Analytics in a couple of weeks  I was wondering if there are any entry level no experience opportunities that could be worked while youre learning for those who need to work while in school,0
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Were really looking forward to seeing more advanced projects in Excel SQL and Power BI on your channel Your content is awesome and were eager for even more challenging stuff,1
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Is this job more hard skills or soft skills

Yes D",1
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Your hard skills get your foot in the door Your soft skills determine if thats the right room for you to be in 

When members of my family have hired people theyve told me that theres this bare minimum requirement of being able to do the job theyre being hired for that gets your resume on a pile But what gets you the job is what you bring beyond that From there it can depend on a lot of factors My grandfather preferred in most instances to hire someone who was moldable so if they didnt have a lot of experience or got the basics but nothing specialized then as long as they were someone he wanted to work with then he preferred to teach them how things worked because he had a specific flow People too set in their own ways clashed in the workplace 

Its not the best or the worst way to hire someone Its simply how things worked for that newsprint company You might be qualified for several different job openings but only a handful are a good fit for you and the company because of all the things youre looking for as an employee and what they are looking for in an employee 

In general what I hear from employers is that being able to do the job is literally the bare minimum and if you want the job you have to bring something to the table they actually need outside of what the other folks can do because all the other applicants that are competition with you are also technically qualified for the job too 

Some great feedback Ive gotten from my mentor for those job hunting is once you get in an interview to ask for feedback from the interviewer on how you can improve They might be honest and tell you that youre hard skills are great and youd be great for maybe another position but for a specific reason not what theyre looking for in this role Which is great because you can still keep your name in the hat if that before mentioned position does open up so long as you can establish a good connection Interviewing and following up can help a lot with networking Even if it doesnt get you that job you were going for it can open doors to other opportunities People talk and someone might suggest you look into applying somewhere else for a role they think youd fit into and then tell their good buddy there to expect you since they thought you were such a great candidate even if you werent the best fit for the role you originally were going out for",1
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Hi Alex thank you for all of your videos I have been watching all of them for the past few months and they have been helping me a lot while I am on the job hunt Now I know what I should work on and the information and resources you have provided have been invaluable Im speaking with the department manager for a company I applied to tomorrow Wish me luck,-1

DWte9zjGl0I,I work with health insurance data has billions rows of data and sql is doing the job,0
DWte9zjGl0I,An update on this topic would be great for 2025,1
DWte9zjGl0I,Thank you for the clarification,0
DWte9zjGl0I,Agreed Logically makes sense practically not so much Picture yourself at work struggling with a task to fix a failing SQL query and feeling stumped,1
DWte9zjGl0I,Thanks for the understanding,1
DWte9zjGl0I,"Hello pls 
Ill like you to talk about Pythonista for iPad Pls make a full review on how the software can be used fod data analytics",0
DWte9zjGl0I,SQL is really easy to learn if you now how to use python guysbelieve you can doingand you can learn SQL in just 1 or 2 week if you use time on itafter that do you need practice just a little is not to hard,0
DWte9zjGl0I,"I am a data scientist who came over from the data engineering side SQL is my first language And the reason is that when you get into the corporate environment and out of the small business start up the corps data is stored on oracle databases Oracle is still the top dog Also a lot of the ETL is adhoc to serve a very specific customer and analysis And the majority of you customers are going to use your data with windows apps Like powerbi and sql server And now you have TSQL And because Microsoft knows most data is stored on oracle servers the quickest way to get data from Oracle to a SQL server is SSIS jobs using attunity connectors  

So you really have to know PLSQL Period Even if your first language was Python 

Honestly I use Python to code in front of  the directors and VPs And to build ML pipelines VPs get grins from ear to ear when you code in front of them showing them some quick analytics and graphs And you cant built ML without Python Simple 

I hope this helps with a bit more understanding",1

EzeeypMKx7o,"This should be the fisrt video of the playlist 

Thanks Alex for all your work",1
EzeeypMKx7o,excellent  you teach by showing the commands in action  rather than focusing on the command syntax  one after another  before demonstrating them  which is too late for grasping the concepts,1

OISvlkfbntY,This is a really nice video by being straight to the point Thanks D,1
OISvlkfbntY,So glad I found this thank you Alex,1
OISvlkfbntY,Very insightful video Thank you for the time you put in it,1
OISvlkfbntY,i reached out to 15 different people between 3 different companies one 1 wrote back and none were willing to help lol job market is a joke12 years experience in my field and cant even get an interview,1
OISvlkfbntY,Sir I have a good offer If In request to postpone  then will the company give my offer to backup candidate,1

OISvlkfbntY,Hi Alex This is Harathi from India I completed My MTech in computer sciences in 2016  After my education I have a gap because of my family reasons Now I want to restart my career Is there any possible to get a Data analyst job role I learnt Mysql now I am learning Python,0
OISvlkfbntY,Thank you very much Alex for sharing your thoughts on the hiring manager from this perspective It is very helpful,1
OISvlkfbntY,but what about the degree If I dont have it but for example I have in portfolio 3 projects ready to see how I work and how I understand coding without experience how is then the situation  they will gonna skip me  its like 999 that everybody is looking with minimum Master degree Thank you for your answer,1
OISvlkfbntY,Whats a working hours data analyst do  8h a day or you can do less,-1
OISvlkfbntY,Hello Alex I hope you are doing great I started selfstudying about 10 days ago with you and Im about to finish the first Udemy course you suggested I bought the Udemy courses you suggested Its going reasonably well so far Although its not exactly your area I would like to hear your thoughts about IIBAs Business Analysis certifications such as ECBA which is for entrylevel positions Do you think it might help people who have no background to get some more interviews,1
OISvlkfbntY,"Thank you so much
This is really informative and helpful",1
OISvlkfbntY,Promo sm,0
OISvlkfbntY,"Just rewatched this video I have an interview tomorrow morning with a hiring manager at a healthcare company for an entry level analyst position and this video helped my nerves a bit The recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn with a couple screening questions after I submitted my application and then scheduled me for the interview after I responded with my answers I feel lucky so far as over 500 people have applied 

Now thanks to this video Im more excited than I am anxious for tomorrow",1
OISvlkfbntY,What about doing a video tailored specifically towards the seniority of the position Like what are hiring managers looking for an entry level job vs a junior and a senior level role I would love a more specific breakdown,1
OISvlkfbntY,I have an interview in the coming days wish me luck guys,0
OISvlkfbntY,Wow Thank you so much well said preparing myself for a job application this time a career shifter from a housewife,1
OISvlkfbntY,I juat amde the decision to become a Data Analyst and i feel like a grain of rice losr in the dessert hiw do i join yiur biitcamp please,0
OISvlkfbntY,Hi Alex I rlly wonder to know ur opinion about the new Comptia Data certification as a plus to get a DA job,1
OISvlkfbntY,As a petroleum engineering graduate its really hard to get a job in this field Its almost a year that Ive been trying to shift into data analytics my only experience with those tools that youve mentioned is based on the projects related to my domain and still havent got any response what can I do to be qualified,0
OISvlkfbntY,If you are a boring reserved introverted indoor person with a stutter who gets the job donelook elsewhere Btw what do you mean by boring Like boring people are not interested in the work they are supposed to do Then of course they should not get the job But if it has to do with other extroverted stuff not related to the job like going out to drink beerthen thats cruel to reject someone for that,-1
OISvlkfbntY,I received a position as a paid intern at AON If you are entry level and have no experience this is the way to go I finished the Google Data Analytics certification and applied for the internship So if you can get in school take a class and go to a career counselor you have a great chance to get a job as a Data Analyst Also ask me any questions if you want,1
OISvlkfbntY,I wish this video had come out two weeks ago I had a referral for a Data Analyst job and the COO was super impressed with my LinkedIn and resume that I ended up skipping the screening and first interview and went to directly to interviewing the analytics team and COO I got a quick response to my followup email and now am waiting for their decision,1
OISvlkfbntY,Pleas Mr Alex can you give me online lesson I Am in Iraq and there are no internships here,0
OISvlkfbntY,"I dont know about some people but being a down person is directly tied to the lack of success unfortunately

Though as a more shy introverted person I do a lot better with inperson interview I am horrible at online interviews",0
OISvlkfbntY,Really love this video So insightful and helpful thank you so much,1
OISvlkfbntY,Im Turkish and I live in Turkey Is it possible to apply for remote jobs in America Do they accept foreigners,0
OISvlkfbntY,I believe a lot in the last topic every time I went through an interview I noticed that the final decision was due to my enthusiasm because I dont even have higher education in the area Im a BI analyst,0
OISvlkfbntY,You are the most positive happy person When you did those skits with the other influencers it was kind of scary It was like Dark Alexhaha,1
OISvlkfbntY,Great stuff Alex In your experience with hiring how important or impactful were references I agree people usually respond better to other people they connect with but could that change dramatically based on feedback from references,1
OISvlkfbntY,a positive personality with a motivated mindset good notes to remember on top of all the other technical requirements that come with the position passion too,1
OISvlkfbntY,This video was uploaded while I was in the middle of an interview I think the interview went well nonetheless but the help would have been nice,1
OISvlkfbntY,For those of us just getting started with little to no college experience and only courses under our belts How could we stand out to get into those first interviews Personally I feel like Im cold calling sending in applications and connecting on linked in Where are the hot leads for entry level positions I know a comment section may not be the best place to be asking a question like this but any insight from anyone would be helpful,1
OISvlkfbntY,"good stuff being mentioned but totally untrue in reality for me First of all probably most of job postings are fake because I have got more than 300 automated emails rejecting me in the past 8 months with the same exact email format Second I got quizzes and tests I got interviews with HR and then proceed to more interviews with senior people One was for a tableau junior entry Even though I am not an expert in tableau I would like to work more on that and I also saw the company as an opportunity to open doors for data career as they were also very open about this I did okish with the tableau technical question  interview I didnt answer some steps when I was asked to create multiple visualizations on the fly However the tableau expert said it was fine and I might need some further training Then  they arranged another interview with data scientists Even though the job was for entry tableau I got asked about python ML NLP and other data science questions I only didnt answer 12 questions but I was super motivated and asked about what they particularly do and stuff like this I also asked them if there is flexibility in the company to change positions say to more data engineering the interview was more focused in this at that time and I also mentioned that I have taken course in ML and this direction and they were even not familiar with MLops 
But I still got rejected After 3 interviews and tests And this took more than 2 months Just a waste of my time and energy
After all this I have no idea how I can even get an entry role I cant believe that they always find a better fit than me Unless they are looking for someone who doesnt know anything and just finished college with no portfolio because apparently I always see people in companies who take training or dont know any of the basics How did they even get the job I have friends who didnt take any data science course or knew anything 1 year ago but got a data science job because they knew someone from the company In the past month I have not applied to any job It is so disappointing Must be something in my face and voice that they dont like even though I feel like I am super friendly to them and they also seem friendly to me but they somehow reject me after the interviews",1
OISvlkfbntY,Thank you Alex Do you think technical interviews or take home exams are common for data analysts especially for entry level roles,0
OISvlkfbntY,Alex I am a bit introverted so I take time to get to know people and later I mix up with the team so is it difficult to get selected in a job interview,-1
OISvlkfbntY,Thank you for this vital info,0
OISvlkfbntY,"Great share Alex I love the point about knowing something about the company beyond the surface level Ive found that its a good move to look up if the company is in the news hopefully not for anything bad but see if they have any new tech innovations to talk about merger with another company etc Then you can carry that forward to the Do you have any questions for me and ask about what the company is doing 

Any other recommendations for the Interviewee Questions phase",1
OISvlkfbntY,I completed your data analyst bootcamp men and I just loved it Big confidence boost up for me You are a good Human being along with a good teacher May God bless you,1
OISvlkfbntY,Do every company use a recruiter or typically upper echelon companies Or is it random,-1
OISvlkfbntY,Everyone in comments section competing against one another may the best prospect succeed as a result of the work done,1
OISvlkfbntY,This was an incredibly helpful video that came out at the perfect time I did a prescreen last week and this afternoon I have an interview with the data team lead and the CTO and to tell you I am nervous would be a massive understatement Thank you Alex,1
OISvlkfbntY,omg this will help me a lot as i have interview scheduled,0
OISvlkfbntY,"That is exactly what hiring managers do caveat n1 At my last company Id moved to another team but still kept in touch with the original team I started with because I liked them You could always be pretty confident that anybody they hired would be just like the supervisor who did the interviewing there were multiple teams on the larger team and the different supervisors had very different personalities  I understand the psychology at play however frankly Im more put off by that kind of thing than people wanting to hire people that want to do the job To be clear Im not particularly put off by either but if I had to pick one practice I liked less it would be the former Mostly mentioning this because I got the impression that you were more apologetic for lack of a better word for the latter I could be mistaken though

Anyway thats a good point about the recruiter screening being a good indicator of what the hiring manager interview might be like I hadnt quite conceptualized it like that before but it makes sense D",1
OISvlkfbntY,Educative this is why you are my favorite Thank you,1
OISvlkfbntY,I appreciate all the help you give us,0
OISvlkfbntY,Hiring managers are looking for AI for now on All those complicated procedures to hire people will disappear as humans commit mistakes and we arent perfect enough to fill all the requirements for a job position Previous experiences are mandatory and all of them created by humanity could be delivered by AI in a few seconds It is only the reality,0

xjA1HjvmoMY,Bro talks way too much just get on with it and show a working example of the code Hint if someone is performing webscraping in python more than very likely they already know html and dont want to spend 20 minutes of listening to you waffling on about html tags you couldve made these videos a lot shorter we dont need a hundred running examples we just need a single example and we dont want to waste time listening to you gabber on about table data tags,0

5l2d_Rv0odE,"I am new user 
Fabric is free to use like powerbi only to publish you need license",1
5l2d_Rv0odE,seems to be a hackers wet dream,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,next time please keep the video bg music in slow phase because some people like me watch at 15x speed The bg music is so fast btw thanks,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Not exactly revolution,-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Thanks Alex for this video 

I am new to Auze Cloud Data engineering Do u recommend starting with fabric or need to study for something else

Note that the time is very important for me I have a project to finish its MVP within just 20 days only

will appreciate if u recommend a free course in what u will guide",1
5l2d_Rv0odE,As usual MS figures out that open source has figured out how to do good things and MS copies it and tells MS zealots that they need to do it the MS way,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Thanks Alex,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,shill,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,is there a certificate and course i can do based on this technology in 2025,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hey guys does onelake support SAP BW and S4 Hana tables,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,I wonder if MS use the data for themselves who cares right lol,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,To learn it do we need to know any programming language Does it require coding,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,"I kind of dont get it
Power BI does exacly the same
so i dont get why microsoft created kind of a copy of power bi",1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Anyone else doing the Microsoft fabric hackathon,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,How does this work with real time production data are data lakes in Azure just powerful enough to handle everything hitting it at once or would you still have some sort of shadow copy of the prod data for things like analytics tools and reporting as to free up resources and performance on prod,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Yes mind blowing is to access a bucket of Amazon through a client that connects to Azure so data first goes from amazon to azure and than from the last to your laptopfacepalm What an innovation lol,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow Microsoft is amazing and innovative,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Synapse Analytics 20,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Great overview thx,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex do you have any plans to release some Fabric Tutorials Im loving your videos and now Im trying to get into Fabric and its Toolkit Greetings from Germany,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,I guess ill add it to list of things to learn,-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,In a week there will be another bunch of names,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Why dont they just call it Microsoft Porridge Just another bunch of disconnected Microsoft names from the the Msoft name factory,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,so we dont need to migrate data to Onelake but we need to have a copy in onelake if we try to access the data from a PC on premise will MS charge for egress traffic,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Seems a lot like SnowFlake and Databricks is this Microsofts attempt to compete gainst Snowflake,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow Awesome is this MS Fabric,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Never got the big deal with Fabric besides it being a new licence model Synapse and Data Factory existed before Basically the news is parquet format and data lake made to work with Apache Spark i mean Databricks,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,interested to know difference between snowflake vs fabric,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Well first time seeing your channel  but I just simply subscribed,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Im a big fan of Palantir Foundry at work Fabric seems to capture many of its best features Though idk if Fabric has a comparable MLOPs capability,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Great tool but such a bad name I wonder why they named it Fabric,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,How is it different from synapse analytics Is not it kind a same,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hey Alex thanks for the great tutorial Short simple and straight to the point,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,What is the difference between Azure Synapse and Azure Fabric,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Love your videos Alex so informative as always Though I have to say for this one that the constant visual effect of the slide changing between the screen and your lovely face with the vfump sound effect across the video is so distracting for me xD,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Can I disengage Fabric while testing my app  Waiting for Node link to appear when executing Core C is slowing me down,-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,The biggest concept aside from accessing data anywhere  its just the use of AI to basically do everything you need  Copilots will help users do everything Is like having a jarvis guiding you through any concept as related to data end to end  the era of AI is just amazing,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Microsoft are bringing their end user data tools to a whole new level If the execution matches the demos it will be game changing really interested in the security and privacy segmentation,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Fabric offers a huge box of opportunities its amazing how much you crammed into this 7 minute video Alex  great work,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hello Alex Can I use a visualization tool to create charts and analysis or do I have to stick with what comes out of the box in Microsoft Fabric,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hey Alex Please let me know ETL dev Vs BI dev Vs Data analyst which will having great opportunity when it comes to hikes demand onsite opportunity,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Because its all standardized in Delta Kale

How is this revolutionary or this news worthy when  this is just the creation of  singular standardized format that can then be used by other systemsplatforms using Microsoft Tools How would this be different from any other competitor coming up with a format that all your users agree to work with  How is is different from any other data conversion toolapplicationsystem",0

5l2d_Rv0odE,Hello Alex I am watching your channel,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex just a quick question I am using Azure Virtual Machine and Azure SQL DB for hosting my website and mobile application Is Microsoft fabric also providing hosting service,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex Im seeking some suggestions I tend to get demotivated whenever I struggle to comprehend certain concepts or fail to solve tasks while taking a course Could you please provide me with some tips on how to stay committed to a course and see it through to the end,-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex I would like to ask for suggestions on how to secure data analyst interviews specifically for individuals with expertise in SQL Power BI and Tableau Is it possible to land an interview if I only have knowledge of SQL,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,oh cool this reminds me of the Databricks approach,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Now its time to make a tutorial Lets grow,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,As an aspiring Data Analyst should I still learn how to use Azure or should I focus on Fabric,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,How is it different from Microsoft graph,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Its all good and well to say you can grab your data from anywhere but often the biggest headache is with connectivity with external platformssystems on the infra side with firewalls whitelisting vnets blah blah blah Concept is good but Im far from sold,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,WTF with a face like that,-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,My question is will this be inuded in Microsoft E5,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,This will replace Data jobs,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow can we get D365 off the dataverse and onto this and be able to write SQL queries,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,buckles in for whats ahead,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Thanks for the video its nice and clear introduction The only point I didnt get is how to centrally manage metadata Is there any central catalog Or Fabric relies on Table format of Delta Lake If so is there a way to get list of all tables,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Could you please make video or tutorial about getting started with MICROSOFT FABRIC,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Future market research may see a downturn Do those who are knowledgeable about market research have alternative employment options,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Im assuming I got this because I watched a tutorial on Power BI lol this is beyond my skill but seems pretty cool,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,One more question alex should we attempt the pl300 exam for data analyst or is it irrelevant now,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Are Microsoft Fabric will be a game changer in the next years and its time to switch over to a windows or Im okay with my suite Im currently an Apple fanboy using Macbook Pro and my analysis suite is Python Tableau PostgreSQL Google Analytics BigQuery is that suite okay,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hello Sir whats your opinion on  International Institute of Business Analysis and its certifications,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hey i am a professional video editor and i can edit these videos in more engaging way,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Great explanation Alex 
Indeed this is going to ease a lot of tasks",1
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Alex Is there another form of payment in Cousera apart from a Credit card I mean the platform says that it also allows Paypal payments for the courses or annual subscripton but when I want to pay with Paypal it also ends me asking for a Credit card

Does the possibilty of paying only with my Paypal account exist  I mean the platform substracting the payments from my Paypal balance Thank you",-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Can you please make a detailed video on different data analytics environments such Azure AWS IBM Google and more
Also how the data world works and the opportunities lies within",1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Sorry for the offtopic question is it possible to work freelancer as data engineer,-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hmm Microsoft One Lake looks like Databricks Lakehouse Does anyone have the same thought as me,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex how will Microsoft Fabric be different from Azure Synapse Analytics which also integrates various tools at one place,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Thanks so much though Im a data science newbie but your video is so good and this is the first time Im watching you do a video I will be following you from now and hoping i get better learning about data science Thanks,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Super,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Funny Your audience I think is mostly people getting started right I for one probably dont even properly appreciate how cool this is the same way my kids dont appreciate that phones dont have cords now,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,I actually downloaded this to start practicing on my Data Analytics,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,What of the recent Tableau updates,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,I love your smile it is contagious,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Also make a video on how to install Microsoft Fabric,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Marketing Just like Synapse most things are concepts or years out before its available Let it snow,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,This is a really useful tool that improves the efficiency of data analytics,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Excellent,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex i hope you can clarify  if we can drop files into one lake do we need ADF,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,As someone who was learning tableau and was preparing for getting transitioned to analytics from 45 months microsoft has kind of stopped that completely While doing job search i can see now that power bi is superior and tableau gonna go down very down Shouldve listened to my friend who told me to learn powerbi instead,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Why do people not mention the limitations for individual user of ower BI premium per user,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Im not sure if Ive understood the concept of Shortcuts  How are we supposed to get the data from SQL  We uses to do it with Import Mode and it usually takes time when we are bringing historical data

Does this change with Fabric  I wont need to use import mode or something like that to save time

For example I work for a company which has the Database in RDS and Im not sure if this could help us or not as this is new and Im exploring what I can do",-1
5l2d_Rv0odE,I need it,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Would you make some videos on Azure,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,"The more you go into Data AnalysisScience the more it gets more interesting 
Im really enjoying this",1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Alex the Analyst will this new Ai tech replace data analysts in the future,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,I think over time small to mid size companies can manage their data analysis themselves with very less workforce and not outsourcing to tech companiesand only very large organisations may rely on huge data analysis teamscant say this will increase or decrease work forceonly time will tell,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Databricks provides the same kinda functionality,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Trying to compete with palantir foundry,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,You are right Alex in saying this is going to be mindblowing Any data analyst knows that the biggest headache is having to access your data scattered across different cloud platforms If Microsoft succeeds in living up to its claims of providing integrated services through Fabric it is nothing less than revolutionary I am expecting a video on this channel on how to use Fabric when it is launched There is no better person than Alex when it comes to understanding data,1
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow,0
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hi Alex I am curious to know your thoughts on what tools Fabric will be replacing My first guess is Tableau,0

IMU1V-JugKo,Hey Alex First I like to say Thank you for putting out this class for free  you are an Awesome Teacher,1
IMU1V-JugKo,hi from NM,0
IMU1V-JugKo,"Thank you so much for this great webinar Alex 
Id like to ask is there a preferred path of learning to follow when learning the tools wed be working with",1
IMU1V-JugKo,I appreciate the timeline piece I began this journey with absolutely no experience or knowledge of data my mindset was total time frame of a year ishbroken down as 69 months ish of learning the multiple skills then few months of multiple projects  updating resume  online profiles and then few months searching for the right job,0
IMU1V-JugKo,This is an excellent video I have great respect for Alex I used to be on healthcare clinical side so it is nice to see I can really progress to analytics when I put my mind and hard work for it,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Alex please stop witht the humm aw humm,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Honestly I did a ECornell certificate for data analytics which taught me only the basics of using excel but not a over all view it was extremely fast paced,1
IMU1V-JugKo,watching again,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Theres no option to save this video,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Im from Las Vegas and in a data analytics program and recently found this channel,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Thanks for uploading,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Im from Nigeria been watching your videos for like 2weeks now I will like to be a data analyst cause I want to achieve something in life,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Can anyone let me know what are the courses in IT industry which AI cannot replace,0
IMU1V-JugKo,when you will upload next part of amazon web scraping project,0
IMU1V-JugKo,To add to prior  its specifically Coursera certificate im currently doing,0
IMU1V-JugKo,"So u specifically mentioned and recommended one of the following in your live stream Tableu DA certificate Microsoft powerBI DA certificate and AWS DA certificate
However how do those certificates you mentioned in the live stream  compare to the Google DA certificate and the IBM DA certificate  I did research and Google teaches R whereby the IBM certificate teaches Python

And I chose specifically and Im currently doing the IBM because the IBM does Python and thought Python would be better as far as transferable and more widespread program skill

So how those 3 that you recommended DIFFER from the Google and the IBM certificate  They better than the Google and the IBM certificate or they the at the same level as far as educational  and real life practical value",1
IMU1V-JugKo,Great stuff   Watching this on replay right now so expecting to get alot of useful info,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Thank you so much,1
IMU1V-JugKo,I am rewatching this I am from Senegal and have 10 years of experience in another domain However unknowingly I have done a lot of analysis throughout the years with Excel I recently decided to completely switch to Data Analytics because it is truly something that I love I am in my very early thirties so this is something that I want for my career Thank you for this video and HUGE shoutout to Alex because his videos have helped me a lot,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Thank you Alex,0
IMU1V-JugKo,This was very informative,1
IMU1V-JugKo,What do you think how much time does it require to replace humans with AI Maybe its too late to dive into this specialization Whats your opinion,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Stupid question ALERT How can I learn Excel if I dont have access to Excel please,-1
IMU1V-JugKo,Thanks Alex I really appreciate this video Helped me a lot,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Im very interested although I have already enrolled in online courses,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Alex sir  I am not clear in career foundry scholarships,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Watching again  This seminar was very helpful and important for all data lovers and Alhamdulillalah i have shared it with my university friends,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Applied for 1200 jobs Damn there are like maybe ten at most available when Ive looked lately,1
IMU1V-JugKo,Can people from third world country apply,0
IMU1V-JugKo,I think watching the first 25 minutes  are much helpful  other can skip the other 45min as its targeting a very specific group of people  and the probability is very low to get the scholarship  overall career foundry program is too expensive for me and most of the viewers  even after getting the scholarship,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Im from Nigeria,0
IMU1V-JugKo,Very useful indeed,1

FpgkpjSyBOw,"Jalapenos Thank you Alex For taking seriously this question that is really scary for some of us or at least for an entry level data analyst just finished a Python bootcamp after experience in healthcare and master in physics
I really hope youre right too and still believe that humans with their critical thinking and flexibility and judgement can bring something to the table that hopefully AI never will
Beside learning the basics do you have any other suggestions for somebody new trying to enter this industry Any specific sector I am thinking healthcare between privacy issues and liability issues might be one of those that will be slower at integrating AI do you agree Thank you",0
FpgkpjSyBOw,jalepinos if every thing goes south i will meet you  alex,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,A little late but,-1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Here is what you are failing to understand As AI become more mainstream a lot more people without data skills will be forced to adopt it so they wouldnt really need to hire that many people to help them run their company Yes people will have to become specialized in the specific areas of data  as it pertains to their occuption and field It just like web design and web development Now anyone can create a simple basic web page and UX design All they have to do is tweak things around This jobs wont go away yet but the barrier to entry will be low and eventually it become more main so that the average person will have better understand of how to use it without really become an expertise The senior level people and seniormid level people from other field will only be needed,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeo  Question for you Alex Considering the current tech bubble which is temporary and the development of AI which is permanent Data professionals with experience are going to compete with the inexperienced newbies Do you think the barrier of entry is getting higher in this field Im considering changing careers but Im not sure if this is a wise move,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,I want to be data analyst but i dont know if AI will replace everything in the future im afraid of loosing time on this field instead of studying something else could u gimme an advice,-1
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Hi Alex hope youre doing fine
Im from India and currently pursuing Google Data Analytics Certification as you recommended that in your video Im a fresher and I dont have any experience I have done BCA so I have a IT background

Im very scared of this whole Chat GPT and AI thing Some say that we dont have to worry and some say that it will take Data Analyst and Data Science job and Im super confused on whom to trust

Please help me Im so worried Should I take another field like Full Stack Developer or something else Please help me 

PS  Please like this comment if youve the same question in mind",1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Garbage in garbage out for example history is doomed by fakery people already have no idea who they really are imagine building your identity from LLMs,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeno  hey Alex need insight Im a working professional in sales in the Banking and Credit was thinking of Persuing a post grad course in business analytics would there be any benefit you feel in this or do you suggest another route,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Holy Halapeos 
Im considering leaving my civil engineer role and study data analytics  to improve my worklife balance this video helped me a lot However Im still unsure  I feel that we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg here and that AI can and will learn itself in its growing process Doing more and more every time",1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeo mi chavo Im in IT for too long and I really want to branch to Data Science,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Hello I am an English learner Could you please tell me what you said at 110,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,I feel touched i have listened from the beginning to the end I have learned that facing the evoltion to adapt but not dodge moreover the essensial solid foundation can always be the best thing weI can do,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,I think AI can help out a lot to get more done However companies looking to save on money by cutting jobs are the only thing that is worrisome,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Hey  if lets say a company pays 1 guy to use AI to do data analytics and the company also pays for subscription of about 10 plugins of AI which costs about 500 lets say and pays the guy about 2000 per month
Then its still a win win for company and businesses rather than paying an entry level analyst 5k a month",1

FpgkpjSyBOw,"Hi

Thanks for the video
I am at the beginning of my journey
Do you think I can feel safe to start studying the field",1
FpgkpjSyBOw,I very much doubt it my company would let us use chat interpreter to feed  data and for it to analysis Too much secure data and if that was being sent to open ai they could use that data for their own benefits too risky I dot to mice using chatgpt to help with sql table creation or queries and helping with dax formulas etc but I wouldnt copy and paste data into chatgpt,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Alex the Analyst THANK YOU  for this thorough and very helpful update  I too was wondering if my career was over  Ive been studying Data Analysis and reviewing Calculus and so excited to get a chance to use my Math skills  and brain again In this fun and challenging field  Thanks for the great Jalapeos,1

FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapenos Longtime RN just getting ready to take the plunge into transitioning to data analytics andor healthcare informatics I have had the same aha moment about the future of what higher education is going to look like in the future So much of the infrastructure that exists today will become obsolete In my opinion it already is Its probably the elephant in the room with college administrators the thing theyre afraid to say out loud I believe that more practical solutions will emerge though Overall very hopeful about the future  Thanks for your insights,0

FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapenos for someone thinking about switching career to softwaredata analytics it is actually relieving to hear that programming languages will be a part of data analytics May be the line in between is not so straight cut after all Who knows what software development will look like with all the AI advancements,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Watched the whole vidoe thanks alot for your analysis Im going to start google advanced analytics thanks to you really appreciate it,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Hi My Mentor Alex Indeed your videos are the best I am following all your channels especially data analysis bootcamp Thanks a lot for your research it helped me understand the power of data analytics as well as AI,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Yes we are interested in daily vlogs related to data analysis,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,5908 do you mean dabble in machine learning,-1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeno      DOUBLE JALAPENO    thanks a lot  can see the amount of time u put into this video  much much appreciated,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,jalapeno,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapenos Thank you for doing what you do having our best interests in mind,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Alex can we have a regular live connect and understand and discuss more on Data Analysis and any new things Others would agree,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Alex could see some worry on your face  AI can evolve lite anything not years but months,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,AI will be like to the analyst like the drill was to the construction worker The panic of well they dont need humans to turn screws now a machine does it so much faster may have been true on the surface but what it really did was just make the workers live easier and let us do more work faster AI like a drill still needs to be held by a human Great video very honest and I agree with your sentiments particularly industry expert turn analyst being a big thing Like Ben Affleck said to Michael Bay during the shooting of Armageddon wouldnt it be easier to teach astronauts how to drill,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,put off watching this video due to being nervous as Im breaking into analytics but this was very insightful and did help put me at ease Thanks for all your content,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,I completely agree Alex I am in school right now for software development and I have been wanting to pursue data analytics thanks to you lol I have been really scared about tech layoffs and AI taking over but you have brought me a bit of comfort Thank you for being honest I think that AI will be a great tool for us to use,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Thank you Iam considering switching careers from procurement and business development administration to either Data Analysis or UXUI I have been profoundly concerned of spending months learning all there is to know about these fields and ending up jobless Your  video was a great watch and i appreciate your nuanced insight,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeo I agree  we need to take this seriously and I am a firm believer AI  will be a complementary tool to our work and we can focus even more time on the fun stuff a not caring as much on all the repetitive tasks as we do today,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Hollapinos,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,All of us could only talk about possibilities But your point of view is one that I think worth to be considered No matter what its gonna turn out eventually Thank you for sharing man,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeos I worked as a catalog manager as a contractor for a year and a half and the company delayed hiring me fulltime because Im 100 sure that leadership was convinced our new automated catalog really just a sql database connected with upstream tools rather than a basic access storefront would make my job obsolete I knew enough to realize that it made me all the more necessary The old database had mistakes that only one person the catalog manager let get into the system Connecting it to the upstream tools made it a pot with a thousand cooks I was right But I got laid off anyway probably because the realization still hadnt made it up to 5 levels up and the whole pot was left in the hands of a recent college grad overwhelmed by it all,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,I think the point thats missing is there wont be a mass layoff of Data Analysts in the next year but certainly within a few years big corporations will be able to refine their data analytics team down to a few key senior members of staff and they will oversee much of the AI automated data analysis,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,As someone who is considering a Data Analytics or Business Analytics masters jalapeo Thank you for this great video,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Absolutely true that ChatGPT is making lots of mistakes Like really dumb ones that I catch easily as a beginning SQL user,1
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapenos from India,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,Youre an inspiration to us Thanks for your valuable opinion about the future with AI,0
FpgkpjSyBOw,I believe all you said is so true I mean yes AI is useful but the people feeding the AI are most important They have to understand if the outcome makes sense  I am starting my masters in Data Science at 50 becaue I want to be better at my field I believe my knowledge of the domain in which I work will help me solve major issues there and of course the good thing is that finding my first entry level job will not be an issue since I work in a company that is using Data Analysis already,1

FpgkpjSyBOw,"Tech industry is messy and fun You just have do an inventory of who you are what you like before thinking of what to learn  And many things you have to just skip Yes AI is will be essential but not all of it
 At the end there is no guarantee that you will succeed if you constantly learn and learn because unlike a robot you are a human You will have an age a life a familiy situation in this game 

Me I got into Business Intelligence in 2012 I learned old school BI and the principles of data warehousing SQL was king Python was good to know then but C better Then my speciality became BI reports  Big data came i didnt jump on board  Data Analyst roles came but I did jump on board They sais much would would die but as we know this is not the case 
I still call me only BI developer witin Microsoft stack I am not that attractive in many roles nowBut for those roles I want Power BI combined with Azure cloud migration I enjoy them because I feel I have made a craft of my skills now and perhaps found employers what suits my well being and happiness  rather than all the time my career ambition I still have jobs  To peole who feel AI  stressed id say

1 Think of economy and the businesses you like to work within How would AI be used in them
2 Think system architecture learn achitectural aspects
3 AI  regulatory aspects within 10 years
3 Learn testing and error handling in general 

AI is here to stay but will be another part of companies ecosystem 
Dont worry They have big marketing out of amazing people like us because we worry too much",1

6jtS3Hz19kc,If you asked me before you did this I would have told you to do a ketogenic diet then fast  It makes sense right,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,Fasting is not good for 48 Hours you need to do at least 3 days at 2 days your resting metabolism will drop but at 3 days it ramps up,-1

6jtS3Hz19kc,bard is way more better now,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,Bard is getting better and smarter now Im also using and training it feeding it with correct information if i happened to spot a mistake Chatgpt is already ahead of bard when it comes to accuracy but chatgpt 4 is paid I currently use both because bard has the current data and latest news that i need I dont have access to chatgpt 4 yet But bard is definitely ahead of bing now And bing is still stupid and boring,-1
6jtS3Hz19kc,I would wait Google Bard to have plugins and not trust shady OpenAI because they cant let you use Plugins with chat history turned off The need data why they sell data,-1
6jtS3Hz19kc,At least as far as coding goes the code Bard produces for me is often broken or at least not as good as the results I get from ChatGPT 4 So as an OpenAI Premium Customer ChatGPT is still leagues better than Bard It may be better than GPT35turbo I am not sure about that,0
6jtS3Hz19kc,bard is nowhere near gpt is not better and it extremely exaggerates and makes up facts if it cant find what youre looking for google has been terrible with its projects and has scrapped countless numbers of them so its not surprising their AI isnt that great theres so many google employees out here simping for this too and leave very obviously fake or generated messages about how its so much better than got but no explanation hoe or its extremely vague its not unusable anymore but if its going to make things up then whats tye point,0
6jtS3Hz19kc,Bard is still pretty twrrible for cosing Ive gried to get it to make simple models of physical phenomena like magnetic feilds and it continually returns code with undeclared variables and nonsense symbols Atill needs a bit of work i think,0

6jtS3Hz19kc,Hello Alex I have been watcing ur videos are learning from you and you were one of the main inspiration for me to get into this profession when I was so many times before thinking of learning data analytics You were the one who inspired me Now I reached to the phase of doing actual projects and practice I wanted a mentor or some advice in doing the projects and I know that u do not have the time to do so if you could just give me a brief answer that I would get the idea and move on from it i took the google certificate and they have some sort of steps to ask prepare process analyze etc I heard that when starting a project I must draw some guidelines or roadmap for myself to work on but as soon as I start SQLing I start to get many different questions because I am trying to analyze and the more I analyze the more I get questions to that need answers how can I write an effective roadmap for myself so that I dont get lost,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,Not available in Germany Nord VPN it is,-1
6jtS3Hz19kc,What I hate about this is Hey we have a cool product but you cant use it yet In Europe that is Just release it and then talk about it Great video,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,You said in the video that you have been using Google Bard for the past couple of weeks and that it has replaced your need for GPT 4 plus subscriptions However Google added the PaLM 2 model to Bard on Wednesday How did you get better results with the older model I had early access to Bard and I used it until recently but it wasnt that great I agree that the new model is better than the old one and that Google has created many useful products that will compete with ChatGPT and Bing AI But I dont think that Bard is better than GPT 4 overall It is better in some ways but not all Maybe their Gemini model will be better since bard  is free like Bing chat and ChatGPT 35 I think that Bard with PaLM 2 is stronger than ChatGPT 35 and it is good enough to use instead of Bing in some cases,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,thanks pro,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,goodWell done,0
6jtS3Hz19kc,Awesome,1
6jtS3Hz19kc,Just like SEO Google Bard will need at least 6 months to get trust from users Chatgpt already got the Authority Itll take time and a lot of input for us to get to trust google Bard,-1

As Ive worked my way through your bootcamp series Ive discovered that the process of coding is like learning all new things You have ebbs and flows where its a real struggle as you learn the new material then you reach one mountain top and get super excited because the material finally clicks and then youre back at the bottom climbing another mountain lol I know pandas and numpy are extremely important concepts to grasp in Python Im just struggling along waiting for them to click However you make it soooo worth the struggle Ive learned SO MUCH already I appreciate YOU As always THANK YOU",1

JpSMse3eVVg,How would you visualize categorical data on a bar graph For example I have a dataset of peoples genders and whether they like an ice cream flavor or not The x axis would be the flavors chocolate strawberry and vanilla The y axis would be the count of true and false responses So each flavor would have two bars on the graph,0
JpSMse3eVVg,"I dont understand why someone needs Pandas when they have Tableau and PowerBI unless they had to

I mean if you have easy tool like excel to build manipulate and create charts and reports you dont go to SQL unless you were dealing with huge data which isnt the case in 95 of the time",1

TPivN7tpdwc,Can we do 2 dataframes side by side in pyspark Similar to concatenate here,0
TPivN7tpdwc,"Key Takeaways for quick navigation

Merging joining and concatenating data frames in Pandas is crucial for combining separate data frames into one
Types of joins inner join default outer join left join and right join
Cross join compares each value from the left data frame with every value from the right data frame
The join function is used to join data frames based on specified indexes but it requires more manual configuration compared to the merge function
Concatenation places one data frame on top of another vertically or side by side horizontally
The append function is deprecated and should be replaced with the pandasconcat function for appending rows from one data frame to another
Understanding these operations is essential for working with multiple data sources in Pandas

PJINexERxOs,I am towards the end of the second course in the Google BI Professional Certificate course on Coursera and I am appalled at the quality of the product It is a complete mess The parts just simply do not add up to create a consistent whole The lessons the terminology the approach to learning the whole thing is just a complete disaster Hours of talking heads and practically no handson challenge Finally the big moment comes and it turns out the Course 2 project has got nothing to do with what you have been learning in Course 2 Total disconnect the systems and skills you have been learning about are totally redundant The critical part of the project is just simply presented to you as a 50something line long SQL query that you can copy and paste from the course The only skill exercised here is some basic SQL JOIN clause scripting which has got nothing to do with this current course and its all done for you anyways There is nothing for you to do Manual data transfer in the most basic way with no piping anything automatically let alone realtime data I have no idea who this course will benefit or who the target audience may be If you already know a little bit about BI this course will give you nothing useful If you know nothing about BI this course will just confuse you beyond repair They keep on rambling about the amazing progress you have made and how youre almost a BI professional yet the course fails to deliver one single bit of useful skills development Shambolic Shameful I have no clue how Google can present something like this or maybe I am under illusions about what Google actually is but this professional certificate program is just a huge dent in Googles reputation as far as I am concerned Farcical Useless Is this what all the rave about Google is about This is alarmingly bad And this is NOT a free course They actually put a price tag on it Pathetic Just get online and read and watch the native BigQuery documentation or the Dataflow documentation and youll be lightyears ahead of a certificate holder from this course Complete waste of time and money,0

PJINexERxOs,I find all the google certificates to be lacking hands on experience this other certificate Im doing is done on Ryme which so far has given me so much more hand on,1

Can you do a review of IBMs new Business Intelligence certificate It uses Tableau",1
PJINexERxOs,What if me or my company does not have the tableau software Is it possible to do the dashboards with ie MS PowerBI,0
PJINexERxOs,Your channel is amazing New subscriber  Do you recommend taking the data analyst course from Google in conjunction to this or should I go straight into learning skills such as a tableau or power bi course,1
PJINexERxOs,The difference between a BI analyst and a data analyst is very vague in this Google certificate and is not the norm youd see being used in the market They use the term BI analyst but explain the workload of a data analyst and a little bit of data engineer Id be grateful if someone could explain clearly how they differentiate between both positions,-1
PJINexERxOs,Hi AlexI have total 6 years of experience in Qliksense SQl and I want to be core data analystI am thinking to take Coursera DA courses   And do you think doing these Courses would help me to justify 45 years of Python R experience for jobNeed your help on thisI am in chaos right now,1
PJINexERxOs,Great platform,1
PJINexERxOs,So glad you enjoyed the certificate Alex,1
PJINexERxOs,Turns out they dont teach you Power BI at all lol,1
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex
Can you please put tutorials on how to use kaggle right from the basic about the competitions and all of it",1
PJINexERxOs,You have to pay for this course so Alex what are you getting from them  Its a free 7 day sub and then you pay automatically after giving them your credit card number Take as old as the Internet,1
PJINexERxOs,"Hey Alex I have a question I have been using Coursera specifically Google Professional courses and IBM and DataCamp so as to do more coding Also I have been doing Coursera guided projects as well My question is which of these two platforms do you prefer Codecademy or DataCamp 
Should I invest time into Codecademy as well for example Data Science Machine Learning track or not Since there are projects that I can do for the purpose of building a portfolio",1
PJINexERxOs,So one of the biggest issues I have is that after the analysis Im supposed to recommend actions based on the insights The data can show patterns and I can highlight those but I dont often know what actions to recommend I did the Coursera Data Analytics Certificate and they briefly went over strategic thinking and business but I still kinda feel lost while Im doing the capstone project,0
PJINexERxOs,Can I take this along the new Google Advanced Data Analytics,1
PJINexERxOs,Its nice you brought up the hands on aspect That was something I needed to focus on more when I started learning data Its such a crucial point,1
PJINexERxOs,Hi Alex I came across the the Business Intelligence Data Analytics Certification from Corporate Finance Institute Please what are your thoughts on it,0
PJINexERxOs,Hey Alex I had a few questions I am currently working a dead end job building car exhaust and Im really wanting to get into data analytics Do you actually think I could get a job doing that without a college degree,0
PJINexERxOs,whats the difference between data science and applied data science,0
PJINexERxOs,"I finished the first course a lot gibberish talk second course was more technical yes but it kind of felt off with ETL then I had flu and thats where I stopped

I did around 45 hours a day on the first course and finished it in 6 days",1
PJINexERxOs,This certification is really wonderful  I am still on the first course which is very theoretical and more of a build up from the Google data analytics I believe its going to be an interesting journey,1
PJINexERxOs,Do you think Maven Analyticss course is more comprehensive,1
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex
Im particularly happy to have come across your YouTube page two weeks ago through a colleague LinkedIn page I have painstakingly watched your SQL TABLEAU and Python courses with lots of knowledge gained I have been managing data for over 10 years with Stata Excel Google Data Studio and DataWrapper I also use Kobotoolbox for data collection However your YouTube channel training has reshaped my career Kindly guide me further as one of your students from Nigeria I am ready to learn more and get a better opportunity for remote jobs overseas",1
PJINexERxOs,I was thinkingyou may not need a whole lot of projects in some of these certificates Coursera has a ton of Guided Projects for various tools and applicationsTableau has 26 Power BI has over 50 and SQL has over 180 project courses I know it is nice to have projects included in the certificatebut if they dont you have the option of taking some of the course projects on the platform,1
PJINexERxOs,hey alex do you think as a data analysis need to learn sas,0
PJINexERxOs,What is the difference between data analytics and business intelligence,0
PJINexERxOs,I have already completed it and I think its good if you are beginner,1
PJINexERxOs,How long before most of these careers are AId into extinction,1
PJINexERxOs,Hi Alex would learning BI and doing dashboards in excel or tableau be a good way to do some freelance work You know a side hustle,1
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex

 I was watching your first SQL project video and I wanted to try and do it but my laptop isnt really strong 3rd world problems  so the SQL server is making it so slow what do you recommend Would MySQL or postgre SQL be better",1
PJINexERxOs,Great video Alex,1
PJINexERxOs,Funny my biggest gripe about the original Data Analytics Course was how little handson work there was with Tableau,1
PJINexERxOs,Very useful information before taking this program,1
PJINexERxOs,Hi Alex can you recommend any course in Coursera for learning sql for data analysis,0

PJINexERxOs,First,1
PJINexERxOs,Greetings Alex thanks,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Alex did you ever do a follow up video after taking the course Id love to hear your thoughts post completion,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Without paying it 40 USD a month via Coursera Plus we are not allowed to enter labs are we,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,so my learning path is IBM DA profession certificate first then Google advanced DA professional certificate just because I really love python programming,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is getting the original Data Analyst PC necessary before diving into this advanced one,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,I wonder if I could take this one straight without the beginner analytics I have some experience with programming and sql but rest of analytics is new to me pretty much everyone seem to say that the beginner course is too slow and shallow but does it have stuff you need in order to be able to follow this course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can i do it in 1 month in india its costing 10m,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,I dont know how they can go from a beginners certificate for data analytics where theres no use of python but R instead and then jump right to an advanced certificate thats heavily based with python Its like youre being set up to fail Why isnt there an intermediate certificate for data analytics Who goes from beginners to advanced I no longer believe anything this reviewer says,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,648 Cmon we use a lot of tools from ML like Kmeans or other types of classification algorythms to do customer segmentation and market research Dont agree,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,im looking to become a data scientist but the IBM data science course has been a bit slow for me could you compare these two courses or is that apples and oranges since its data analytics over data science,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can you take this as a complete beginner,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is it a free certification,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hello Alex thanks for this video Can I go directly to this course without the first one,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Thanks Alex 
Question I have no experience in data at all However I am interested in data science rather than Analytics  Which one do you think might be better for me The Google Data Analytics Cert Program or the Google advanced data analytics Cert program",1
gTf2GLEhKgA,brother how can u review a course while sponsored by the teacher maybe a little biased,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Education is generally worth it but this course covers too much They should have broken it down starting with a foundations course on Relational Data Modelling  SQL and Self Service Data analytics Desktop and Cloud,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks a lot for this Video Alex Im new to the data analysis I was planing to take some certificates on data analysis What do you think about taking the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate first and than Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate Or can I jump directly to Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Shall I start first with the first course or the IBM one since IBMs one does not have R,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,do we get certificate on each course completion,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,I just started it but I forgot most of the last course,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Answer Yes,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,very helpful thank you Alex,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hi Alex amazing video  930 I am actually interested in taking their advance course because I am more interested in learning Phython BUT I have not taken their beginners course that has SQL and Rdo you think its advisable to skip the beginners course,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks for the information and Im taking the class,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Not sure if I missed it but will the follow up video be posted anytime soon,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,I am finishing the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certification Comparing it to Google Advanced Data Analytics do you think the courses are the same or is the Google course a complement to the IBM course,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hy Nicholas Myself Ajay Ive been meaning to reach out to you for quite some time now I wanted to know opinion on my roadmap for Data Science for Geospatial Industry I will not waste your time I will share what I am doing write now and what are my goals are and please give me idea what to do

I have a postgraduate degree in geoinformatics but Ive had trouble finding a suitable job in the field of spatial analysis This is mainly because I lacked Python skills However as soon as I started the CS50 Python course I realized theres a whole world of spatial analytics out there which is essentially like supercharged spatial analysis with data science Im currently enrolled in CS50 Python and plan to take CS50 SQL next After that I wanted to know if Googles Advanced Data Analytics course is a good choice for someone like me who doesnt have a fundamental understanding of data science and statistics Im also interested in statistical learning but Im not sure how to go about it since its currently in R on edX I did find a book in Python for it though

I also have an interest in computer vision applications in the field of earth observation and machine learning for spatial data patterns Essentially I want to do what Foursquare and CartoDB are doing in spatial data science with a focus on image processing for earth observation although this part can wait for about a year",1
gTf2GLEhKgA,If i didnt take initial course should i take this advanced one directly or is it necessary to take the initial course to learn the advanced one,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Do beginner can take this course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hi AlexI have total 6 years of experience in Qliksense SQL and I want to be core data analystI am thinking to take Coursera DA courses  And do you think doing these Courses would help me to justify 45 years of Python R experience for job Need your help on this,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hello I have question that 
Is it ok if I subscribe Coursera LITE to learn then I switched to Coursera PLUS to get the certificate
I want to save money",1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Did they cover NumPy Pandas libraries in this advanced Cert course,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,I am complete beginner and confused between fundamental DA course  and this advanced DA course So which one should i opt so that i can work as Data scientist and land a great job  pls provide me the road map,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Totally excited Glad they added python,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Did you take the course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Should I do both Im doing my MS and want a refresher on a lot of the topics,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,R was shit,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Alex loved the video  Is it just me or is YouTube cutting your content short  Seems like I missed your comments on like the last three courses and whatever you might have wrapped up with  Probably just me  Very interested in this Coursera offering  Cheers,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Im half way with Google Data Analytics I have ZERO exp within the Data Science realm and wondering if I should continue with the Advanced course right after I finish course 1 should I

Looking forward to nail my first entry level Data Analytics job but have IT experience as Unix Sysadmin

Alex could you please advise",1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Alex great guidance thanks for sharing I would like to ask you DO I need to do the Analytics Certif I have already work on Python or can I go to the Advanced course having the knowledge in Python htanks,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks for the thorough review,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can i take this course without the google Data Analytics course  Cuz i hate R And i prefer python,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can you compare this with IBM Data Science Professional Certificate,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Very nice video sir,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,I dont have an issue with that,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Looking forward to it,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Should I take it without the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,I got this certificate after two days,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,thanks for his video that describes the certification really well Theres only one aspect I think you misunderstood Data analytics is not data analysis  analytics does involve machine learning for pattern recognition trend analysis etc,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Im halfway through the basic google data analytics professional cerificate should i stop it and switch to the advanced one or should I take this after Im done with the basic one,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,got a degree on software engineering want to start on data analytics should I take this one or entry level,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Im guessing you like this course because well you know Python But anyone taking this course for the first time beware  they go over the basics but very quickly throw you into scenarios that are pretty complex And if you get stuck on something or have a question forget it There are zero instructors or anyone there to answer those Nobody Figure it out or fail I a 23 year tech vet started this course day one and am pausing for a month to learn Python first And then Ill return to the course because I do want the Cert Pretty ridiculous,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is this a certificate or a certification,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Would it make sense for someone to get more hands on professional experience in analytics before taking this course or is it appropriate for someone who just finishes the first Google Data Analytics certificate to jump straight in My assumption is that this course would make more sense for someone trying to level up and who already has worked in DA Thoughts,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,"The Google Advanced Data Analytics is amazing
In my opinion the name of the program should Google Data Science program rather than Google Advanced Data Analytics
Because it focuses on Data Science just like the IBM Data Science program",1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Tq Alexmuch appreciated,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,I really hate when people say something that makes perfect sense only to follow it up with if that makes sense Sorry just needed to vent,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Im not sure if you are working hard it is possible to learn this course even in 6 months Thank you for video,-1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can you take the advanced certificate without taking the beginner certificate as a prerequisite I ask because I want to study Python not R,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,The first course was piece of dog shit So not gonna get another course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Lets complete it together,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,can a begginer take this course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,would i be okay to take this course with no prior experience,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hi Alex so since they didnt include any advanced SQL courses Do you think they should have since SQL is such a common skill that most companies are looking for What are your thoughts,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hey guys Im taking the Google data analyst certificate and I only have AS degree Most of the jobs in LinkedIn require a BS Is there any change I can land a job when I finish the course I am willing to earn a livable wage about 40k while Im learning and gaining exp,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hi if I havent done the nonadvanced now should I do it Or can I save money and do this one instead,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,Wanted to ask if these courses are updated with the new analytics 4,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is there SQL in this course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,How do they charge the fees Monthly or per course,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,IBM Advanced Data science certification is more advanced than google advanced data analytics  Also IBM Data science professional certification is better than google data analytics,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Im wondering if its worth skipping right to the advanced google certification I got my first data analyst internship this summer and Ive taken stats and econometrics as part of my economics degree I also know some basic Python Should I still do the first google analytics course or would I be prepared enough to do the advanced one,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hi Alex for a beginner to Data Analytics would you suggest taking the original Google Data Analytics course or we can directly take this Advanced course,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Bagging refers to the bootstrap aggregation a Decision Tree Classification method where you make full tree based on the bootstrapped dataset It is an ensemble method that is we group the results of these Bags and predict on the basis of combined result,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,so do i have to take the first course to take the advance one,1
gTf2GLEhKgA,Would you recommend I start with the Data Analytics certificate or could I start with with the Advanced Certificate I have some background in coding but not much in the other subjects,0
gTf2GLEhKgA,You are the best,1

Im writing to express my sincere gratitude for your video tutorial on groupby in Jupyter Notebook It was very helpful in understanding the basics of calculating means for grouped data

However I noticed that the tutorial didnt explicitly address how groupbymean handles nonnumeric data In the current version of pandas attempting to calculate the mean of a column with nonnumeric values will raise a TypeError

I found solution that by passing numericonly  True in mean  the issue is resolved

I would be grateful if you could consider updating the video to include a note to pass numericonly  True in mean

Im actually just starting the whole transition from graphic designer to data analyst I feel that one of the harder things for me would be how to reword my resume into a data resume when all my experience is definitely not data related The only tool that comes close is excel and that was just pulling reports from a program and uploading the file to the cloud

So Im just unsure of how I should go about that but maybe your future video will touch upon that

    png jpg  path foldername
    txt  path foldername

gs0FNQR0njI,"Great video
But I would have a suggestion to make instead of creating manually folders and checking the file type it would be much better to teach how to create a more flexible code with other file types
So a thought about something like this
for i in names
    if not ospathexistspathi3 files
        osmakedirspathi3 files
    if not ospathexistspathi3 filesi
        shutilmovepathi pathi3 filesi
Doing this you can create a folder for any type of files and check if the files are already there

gs0FNQR0njI,Im not able to make file folders,-1
gs0FNQR0njI,Hey Alex  I know you get so much of these comments already but I just wanna say thank you for creating these tutorials Ive been faithfully following your Excel Tableau and Python tutorial and they all really help me understand better than some paid courses Ive been through Cheers,1
gs0FNQR0njI,Alex Another project is completed Every new step in your bootcamp increases my curiosity to go further I am really into it  Again many thanks for your time and knowledge I have never been so involved in IT education as I am now with your teaching approach,1
gs0FNQR0njI,thank you but i think you forget to add video about how to clean data using python,1
gs0FNQR0njI,Hi Alex its not working out is there any other way to do this,-1
gs0FNQR0njI,The PCWizKid mouse cursor is a classic,1
gs0FNQR0njI,I did this but Im using a Mac couldnt get the path to be inside the folder no matter what I tried the path was just outside the python tutorials folder,0
gs0FNQR0njI,Hi Alex I am getting an error that says NameError name os is not defined Any help is greatly appreciated,1
gs0FNQR0njI,Hey Alex I do not find live server in visual studio extensions How should I get it,0
gs0FNQR0njI,When you had the Else statement and it returned the message 4 times would that have been because of the 3 folders I think it may have counted those as a file in the folder,0
gs0FNQR0njI,Hey alex would you be kind enough to confirm if your data boot camp covers all the basics of those tools so after that i can move on to intermediate stuff  Thanks,1
gs0FNQR0njI,When I was learning python last year I did this to myself cause I needed it for my downloads folder you did it in 16 minutes I was there for like 3 weeks hahaha,0
gs0FNQR0njI,great content,1
gs0FNQR0njI,was a great one but I would rather refactor the code in a way to avoid getting too many if statements spread out in the code just to keep redundancy away from it Subscribed,1
gs0FNQR0njI,Hi Alex I would like to thank you for all of the effords you went through to help everyoneI really appriciate youI dont live in US but Do you think with a portfolio that has up to 10 different projects i can land an interview on linkedin for a remote job,0
gs0FNQR0njI,"Hi Alex

Ive tried to do something similar based on your video The task Ive set was I have a lot of files which names have identical beginning in my Downloads and I have tried to move them all to a single folder 

Heres what Ive tried to do and it has worked not from the first try to tell the truth but still

import os shutil
path  rCUsersidemianenkoDownloads
filename  oslistdirpath
osmakedirspath  Credit notes
for file in filename
    if invoiceprint in file
        shutilmovepath  file path  Credit notes  file

Thats why your channel is a box of wonders for me Thank you for your content and wish you lots of luck",0
gs0FNQR0njI,Awesome video here Is another mini project video where you can gather all files with a similar name from a folder in python and set them up for analysis,1
gs0FNQR0njI,shutil is called shell utilities because it allows you to perform various filerelated tasks that are similar to the commands that you might use in a Unix shell such as copying moving renaming and deleting files and directories,0
gs0FNQR0njI,Thanks so much for this amazing content I found this online learning platform called microverse Do you know anything about it and would you advise anyone looking into switching careers thanks,1
gs0FNQR0njI,Hey Alex I know this isnt exactly related to the video but I have a question Do you think a company would hire someone as a data analyst if all they had were mere basics Simply they didnt have a degree in the area perhaps a certification but they had a driving spirit to learn Or are most people even for entry level positions expecting you to just drop into the seat and go off with little to no extra help,0
gs0FNQR0njI,Also I had issues doing the amazon webscrapping project you posted about a year ago because a lot had changed in the webpage source I asked for help but I didnt get a response we understand youre busy we dont your time for granted or feel entitled to it but do you plan to do another web scrapping project to include in the Free Boot Camp,1
gs0FNQR0njI,Damn Alex is so real Can we write a program to automatically detect the file formats create folders and sort them accordingly  Because I feel it could be difficult to manually detect and name the folders if the list is endless Sounds like a clustering thing  in machine learning but Im not sure Please what do you think,-1
gs0FNQR0njI,Do you think this will be good project to put in our portfolio,1
C75TROiiEa0,Alex can you please review Google AI studio especially screen sharing feature And also your opinion how it will effect whole courses industry,0
C75TROiiEa0,,0
C75TROiiEa0,impressive thank you,1
C75TROiiEa0,There is only one word to describe this pretty impressive Two words Humans,1
C75TROiiEa0,How would it work for SEO,0
C75TROiiEa0,Thanks,1
C75TROiiEa0,I wasnt interrupted by a network error I was interrupted by a boatload of ads,0
C75TROiiEa0,Anyone can tell me if that would be the best setup to analyze Roulette spins made by a specific table Also Im trying to build the perfect prompt to get GPT to tell me the next number within 6 chips using that info like an algorithm would Ive seen a few built that gives the exact number but they wont share or sell,1
C75TROiiEa0,Love this channel,1
C75TROiiEa0,You should give the Noteable plugin a try it can do some pretty amazing things,1
C75TROiiEa0,I dont want to pay for it It has all these limitations though The paid version almost eliminates these problems I still dont want to pay for it,0
C75TROiiEa0,You need to do a video explaining WHY this isnt valuable enough to pay for,0
C75TROiiEa0,"Thanks for a great video
How can I analyze big data sets with chatgpt or any other AI engines",1
C75TROiiEa0,Some of us may have to pivot real quick from BADA to something more accommodating,1
C75TROiiEa0,I dont really believe in payingreally  Is this youtube channel freeand you make no money from it How are the creators of chatgpt supposed to make a living You should say I believe in paying but I dont have the money right now,1
C75TROiiEa0,All examples are for small datasets of a few records Is it possible to use chat GPT for analysis with a larger dataset of say 500 or 800 records 40 variables how,-1
C75TROiiEa0,"You seem to be more excited with the technology than the results I have been trying to accomplish one real life common simple fiduciary problem I ran hundreds of variations to get the correct answer ChatGPT has yet to come close to solving the problem that I can just look at and solve 

I would have no problem paying for the product if it worked",1
C75TROiiEa0,Are you serious when you claim that you are actually using ChatGPT for data analysis or its just to make a catchy title for your video Clearly ChatGPT cannot possibly directly analyze any meaningful sized dataset You are purely using it for code generation for dummies and misleading others about what ChatGPT can actually do for data analysis today,0
C75TROiiEa0,Next Gen Hacking  ChatGPT  Im looking,0
C75TROiiEa0,"Pretty much aligned with not just how but also why I use gpt In a relatively short space of time I replaced what I used to do with SQL and Excel with Python generated with gpt no prior python or coding experience Just like you showed in this example just that in the end I made Python files and global functions to run what I ran with the first few data sets I explored Getting this phase of ETL so quickly implemented brings the more fun and brain taxing part of working with the resulting data up front in no time at all Which brings me space and time to keep going with gpt to implement more code to do tasks I need done formulating them dynamically as I go so they can be reused which leads me to think that a web based browser is on the horizon to run my functions based on user inputs instead of me via an IDE
Which of course one can use gpt for again to try out build refactor In effect I am building a tool for myself to replace a lot of what I usually find I need to do just to get me somewhere where the real work of solution building begins but with a tool box of data exploded from source data And it seems no sign at all ahead of what gpt and python cant help me with
It just today advised that for the next step of my actions formulating structured data points from unstructured comment fields that with Python I can utilize X Y Z libraries in A B C steps to approach my task What is stunning is that you can ask gpt to do a task for you like write some sql code  but you can then ask it to give you the python code it used to output the sql code to me so that I can make a function and not have to come back to gpt again for the same ask
I dont give gpt any data  just tasks and examples
It would be fantastic to have a gpt on my local machine with access to UI commands like I do through keyboard and mouse referencing  to action these actions to save files write files run queries I dont really like the idea that any of my true code and data and use case is sent to OpenAI however  for sure they must have an gpt like model reviewing all user inputs and gpt outputs and clustering on content and use per user interaction with gpt anything we share is somehow also in their awareness and so customer data is a no no to use on the platform but also I am concerned how long we will have free access to what we currently have access to OpenAI know what I use gpt for whats to say it sees that so many of us are doing similar that they dont pursue the plus model for coding specific and thats then accessible only through paying Its a fantastic tool just the future looks very foggy to me as to where and how this will go",1
C75TROiiEa0,if you tell chatgpt what version of the programming language you are using it will give you better answers otherwise it is trying to figure it out through context clues either in your code or from your conversation,1
C75TROiiEa0,For ChatGPT profit equals revenue,0
C75TROiiEa0,For people watching this before starting their data analysis journey  NO this will not make much sense Yes learning basics of of data analysis python SQL etc is required to know the jargonslanguage of how to word your prompts Alex has provided some certifications in the desription to get started,0
C75TROiiEa0,noob question here but if its already possible what about in 3 years  will data analysts jobs all obscelete  thanks,0
C75TROiiEa0,000218 I dont really believe in paying Huh,1
C75TROiiEa0,Why wouldnt you be willing to pay 20m for something that can save you huge amounts of time,1
C75TROiiEa0,"Awesome video Alex  thanks When dealing with a much bigger dataset that is too many tokens for a single prompt how do you propose using GPT to analyse the data It looks like some people are using GPT in a Jupyter notebook to analyse the full dataset

Im not an engineer so do not know exactly how to set this up Would you consider showing how to do this in a future video",1
C75TROiiEa0,But still recording YT videos,0
C75TROiiEa0,I spent 35 yrs working in big data analytics at one of the credit bureaus  started out on mini computers and moved to the very first pcs so I have literally seen it all I spent the last 3 months playing with GTP4 on a couple of private big data projects and in conjunction with an ETL tool like alteryx I can do in half a day what it took a small team of phd stats 3 months just 15 yrs ago GPT is extremely impressive in generating code but equally impressive in suggesting methods  Without doubt GPT and it like are going to radically change data analysis and probably allow the more creative folks to win out over the less creative It will mean fewer programmers and data engineers for sure If I were 22 again I would make sure I had the widest possible understanding of  business processes  problems and a wide range of analytical methods at a theoretical level AI will plug the gap,1
C75TROiiEa0,Can you performa ANOVA using chatgpt prompts,0
C75TROiiEa0,You lost me on I dont really believe in paying,1
C75TROiiEa0,Dont you think AI will kill data analyst  jobs I am bit concerned,0
C75TROiiEa0,Where your dataset stopped it is hitting the size limit it is trying to pass your whole chat  to the gpt api or on the free one if servers are too busy Most of the time you can just type continue and it carry on from where it stopped when I found that keyword it made my life a lot easier on GPT4 not sure if it is available on the paid version yet I think it is only for approved beta users it can go up to 32K in size gtp35 turbo can go up to 4k and i think gpt3 is 2k,1
C75TROiiEa0,What a mooch,0
C75TROiiEa0,"As a new R programmer I turned to chat gpt 4 the latest one to get unstuck several times I had a very similar experience I was totally blown away by how quickly it understood my dataset with just one code But I was equally blown away by its shortcomings in doing simple things such as it kept giving me the same wrong code over and over even after I told it that the code isnt working and why It went in a loop But it always tries to please by apologizing even when I am wrong  Its fun to work with CharGPT but its important to understand its limitations 
One time it generated a super complicated code for a very simple task which even as a beginner I could see So I was able to get the results with a simple code and went ahead told CharGPT Its response was like its great you found a simpler solutions please share your code with me so that I can update my system or something similar So I ended up teaching my new friend a thing or two  
With coding we can always see where the AI is wrong right away as we wont get the results but for general knowledge stuff its better to double check from other sources before committing to the info given by CharGPT Its never said that it doesnt know something or is unsure of something even when its wrong Try asking why do you make so many silly mistakes for a fun answer unless it generates less amusing answers for some people Overall its amazing to work with CharGPT because it actually feels like you are conversing with a human on the other side a human who can er",0
C75TROiiEa0,Lost all respect when you said you really dont want to pay for it Especially with the amount of processing power youre costing them with your huge requests SMH,1
C75TROiiEa0,Im asking this on several channels brand new to ChatGPT and have been trying to sign up since Monday this is Wednesday so 2 days now I always receive the same error message saying signup is not available Any suggestions,0
C75TROiiEa0,NETWORK ERROR Yeah maybe its worth the measly 20 for THE best tool ever invented I just dont understand how this guy and everyone else are saying I dont believe in paying yet you pay 6 for a Starbucks coffee every day Chat GPT is worth 1000x what theyre charging 20 Thats IT Shut up and TAKE my money You really dont want to pay for it WHY Its literally worth GOLD having this tool Dont you get it,1
C75TROiiEa0,Id love to see a more full analysis example,1
C75TROiiEa0,When the answer stops in the middle type continue and press return If it was not too late it will continue where it stopped,-1
C75TROiiEa0,It does In fact Ive been working on a project that combines ChatGPT and SQL to make big dataset analysis possible with ChatGPT We launch on ProductHunt last week,0
C75TROiiEa0,So is it pointless to get a Bachelors in Data Analytics,-1
C75TROiiEa0,ill never use any kind of AI in my analysis work I would rather spend 3 hours trying to solve a problem than be handed the answer in few minutes because thinking and doing the analysis by hand is actually a learning in its own taking the easy shortcuts is bad,0
C75TROiiEa0,Great video Im curious to know though What do you mean by you dont believe in paying,1
C75TROiiEa0,Only a month old yet sounds like its te h from 1950s lol,1
C75TROiiEa0,My company is a hater  They banned it,0
C75TROiiEa0,Hi Alex Can you work with chatgpt to find relationship between data to do some predictive analysis,0
C75TROiiEa0,i dont really believe in paying Thats about when i hit Subscribe,1
C75TROiiEa0,While this is useful in a stand alone context the most benefit will come when it is fully integrated into coding environments and data analysis tools with training optimized for those specific activities    Right now just using chatgpt in a stand alone context is limited and for full use of this functionality you still need data engineers programmers and so forth to build applications around it    One problem however is the cloud nature of chatgpt and the fact that they ultimately want you to pay for it which limits how it can be used in open source projects,1
C75TROiiEa0,How do you save the different chats that you have on the left into tabs or folders,0
C75TROiiEa0,Awesome,1
C75TROiiEa0,Today the way to design is so different Feeling I am losing my job after coming across this video which shows how the AI drawing,0
C75TROiiEa0,hard coreinfo,-1
C75TROiiEa0,Theres token limitation on ChatGPT Not suitable for data processing It will be too expensive,-1
C75TROiiEa0,It will be interesting to try these in GPT4 now,1
C75TROiiEa0,I agree with you that its amazingly impressive Theyre not really using code to do this Theyre using a massive neural net trained on petabytes of language data and a bit of feedback on what we humans perceive as helpful or not,1
C75TROiiEa0,Often times when it stops outputting you can simply type Continue as your next prompt The other thing you should know is that it doesnt stop because the server is overloaded but because youve reached a character limit in the output For the same reason you cannot do real data analysis with ChatGPG Try adding a dataset of greater than like 100 rows and 10 columns It wont work You can break out the data into pieces and feed it prompt by prompt but then you run into a data memory retention issue You shouldnt tell people they can do analysis with ChatGPT unless their dataset is miniscule It wont work otherwise,0
C75TROiiEa0,"ask chat gpt about simple math such as what it is 22 and it will say it is 4 as usual then ask again by saying you heard that it is 5 he will say 
4 but then ask again your wife believes it is 5 then chatgpt will be convinced that it is 5 not 4 and will apologize to you",0
C75TROiiEa0,Was interesting up to the point you said you didnt believe in paying for it Lost me there Bye,1
C75TROiiEa0,You were so polite and valued its work  I wonder how people growing up now getting used to ai doing hard work for them even if they are absolutely rude will affect our society,-1
C75TROiiEa0,Well this is unfortunately restricted to 4000 tokens So partial content is a mess,-1
C75TROiiEa0,I am not new to data analysis but am new to actually doing it systematically Should I start elsewhere in the series I am very familiar with gpt,1
C75TROiiEa0,I dont really believe in paying,1
C75TROiiEa0,The data set is so tiny it beggars belief  Deep leaning is rather shallow so far  Some onetrickpony show does not convince me  Those of shallow nature may be thrilled but its just a show  Just one step up from a glorified search engine  The Turing test has not been breached  Talk to it for an hour with 50 topics like we do with each other then it will fail because its logic wanders  Sentience and Heuristics are missing,0
C75TROiiEa0,Dont use ai  its a lazy thing to do,-1
C75TROiiEa0,RIP Stack Overflow  Oh they must be pissed,0
C75TROiiEa0,data analyst people should be worried,0
C75TROiiEa0,Write me a script where I dont use the word but in every other sentence,-1
C75TROiiEa0,Junior and even midlevel engineers will really benefit from simply being able to paste code and ask why the code was written in a particular way Ive given it some pretty complex SQL code and it explains it correctly,1
C75TROiiEa0,At time 218 I dont really believe in paying I can understand that But you must believe in being paid given the join button I believe in both At any rate thanks for the video Great quality,1
C75TROiiEa0,cool  I use ChatGPT for Sql code most time give 100 correct code,1
C75TROiiEa0,Thank you for another interesting and relevant video for data analysis,1
C75TROiiEa0,Have you looked into the token use you get with each chat Once you hit the limit you need to start a fresh chat,1
C75TROiiEa0,Very interesting,1
C75TROiiEa0,By the way you can ask Did you time out and it will retry the last answer often completing it instead of stalling like it did previously,0
C75TROiiEa0,This is impressive,1
C75TROiiEa0,Loved the video Please make more on how to use AI like this,1
C75TROiiEa0,I believe ChatGPTs operating memory space today is 4097 inputoutput tokens which approximates 3000 words  This is perhaps why you are seeing truncated outputs or limited memory of historical input,0
C75TROiiEa0,"Guys to be honest you should not much rely on GPT3 Here is what it told me 
ME Is it possible to get the wrong code from your side
GPT3 As an AI language model I dont have the ability to deliberately provide incorrect code However its always possible that there could be mistakes or typos in the code that I provide so its a good idea to doublecheck the code and results to ensure they are correct",1
C75TROiiEa0,Just a tip when chat gpt stops like that you can just tell it to continue your response from where you left  you stopped mid way  and he will continue the previous response  pretty cool,0
C75TROiiEa0,Your Data Analyst job is at stake,0
C75TROiiEa0,You dont belive in paying for a product your want to be paid to use And youre a data scientists using the hard work of other data scientists and you want to be paid for your work but them not get paid for theirs,-1
C75TROiiEa0,Its not the server overloading why its erroring out It has a max of 4000 tokens  3000 words thats why it stops Just insert your data before and ask it to continue from where it stopped and itll finish your code for you,0
C75TROiiEa0,the way ites generatting sql and python codesi guess any non coder can become a data scientist,0
C75TROiiEa0,I dont even think youre an analyst at least not a good one,-1
C75TROiiEa0,When it gets stuck you can just ask to continue and it will continue where it left off,0
C75TROiiEa0,"The most interesting thing  I would use AI for is to simulate time lines with the purchasing power of people  For example buy a home at varying prices time lines and then measuring the quality of life on average following the guidelines

For example make a shopping list of everything you ever want to buy in the next  30 years then ask AI what prices everyone would have to sell those things under which timelines then perhaps we could redesign economies more efficiently",1
C75TROiiEa0,,0
C75TROiiEa0,I made a gui that allows me to open a txt file and convert it to a csv and you can select your file path to save the new csv file the possibilities for this are amazing,1
C75TROiiEa0,You can ask it to continue when it gives you just a part of a code and it will,0
C75TROiiEa0,Thanks for sharing this video on how to use ChatGPT for data analyses I found it very informative and useful However I just wanted to mention that you can save yourself a lot of time and effort by using OpenAI API instead of copying and pasting the data each time into ChatGPT OpenAI API offers a range of powerful tools and features for data analysis including language processing text summarization and sentiment analysis which can help you streamline your workflow and improve the accuracy of your results Just thought Id share this tip in case you hadnt heard of it before Thanks again for the great video,1
C75TROiiEa0,always so inspiring Alex Ive used the explaining generating commenting approach myself and funny story it actually gave me the wrong code once and when I entered can you correct the code because your code is giving me the wrong output for n90 it corrected itself and gave me an optimized accurate code so we def need to be careful on not what all we can do through chatgpt but also how to do it,0
C75TROiiEa0,This is amazing Alex you have perfectly described the scenario ChatGPT is a complete gamechanger and i believe that if we use it wisely we can definitely reap benefits in our existing jobs They are not here to replace the jobs but to support us Keep posting such nice content,1
C75TROiiEa0,"just type continue and it will 
1900",0
C75TROiiEa0,"Hi Alex amazing video Ive always been interested in the data science field and working full time as a data analyst But I have a few questions about the same It would mean so much to me if I could have just 10 minutes of your time and discuss those questions 

And again thanks for the great content",1
C75TROiiEa0,FYI if the response from ChatGPT is cut out its likely because the token for the conversation is run out You can just prompt with continue or go on to continue writing previous response,0
C75TROiiEa0,and now tell me that data analysts wont be redundant in 5 years,-1

L-QnW_BZT3c,Alex God bless you You keep on inspiring us,1
L-QnW_BZT3c,Hi Alex  I have a question to you  Most people said that data analyst jobs are not entry level jobs  So if anyone wants to aim to build a career in this profession without degree is it possible,1
S76iS03nGis,Hey alex this us amazing i was wondering what if these courses are outdated Ill really appreciate if uh make an update version of this videos,0
S76iS03nGis,Thanks alex for sharing an amazing knowledge for beginners as a analytics,1
S76iS03nGis,Can you do an update to this video for 2024 Because that excel pivot tables course is now 200 Would appreciate if you can do a 75 dollar diy curriculum again but for 2024,0
S76iS03nGis,I think the best thing about these courses for anyone already in a data analysis role is just learning what everything is called In job postings and interviews hiring managers like using short hand and buzzwords Knowing the skills isnt enough though it should be you have to be able to convey through buzzwords and acronyms what you can do so hiring managers will pick you Also dont underestimate yourselves and your skills I just had to teach a business analyst with 25 years of experience how to do a vlookup,1
S76iS03nGis,If you are Brazilian and dont speak english I think the best place for learn Python better than paid courses is the Youtube channel from Gustavo Guanabara  Curso em Vdeo,1
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex do you think that Kyle Pews excel class is a good alternative I am just curious given it is a much longer course,1
S76iS03nGis,This video is one of the most interesting Ive seen regarding the topic of learning new skills and which videos will help us with that It would be nice for you to make a make a video where you will describe your  time table of course taking on the job and after so we can maybe incorporate some of those habits into our own jobs basically if we are in a similar situation where we can learn on the job it would be nice to see your schedule so maybe we can include that in our dayjob,1
S76iS03nGis,"His list is pretty good as I have taken most of these  Jose is number 1 for Python  Colt wasnt that good as he has trouble staying focused and 100 days of code was the worst course  If you cant learn with Jose zero to hero you wont learn anywhere else  

Udemy is much better than Coursera which I wasting 4 to 5 months and didnt learn or retain much  Udemy got me understanding python and sql within 3 weeks  By month 2 I was completely comfortable with the basics and some advanced coding",1
S76iS03nGis,I am currently doing the MySQL udemy course and so far seems very indepth  Although the content is very good it moves at a pretty rapid pace for learning  So I am wondering if you did anything to practice what you had learned  I find that just moving onto the next lesson doesnt solidify what I have learned,1
S76iS03nGis,or is it just core courses you ill need to then take the actual course,-1
S76iS03nGis,Does this curriculum take you all the way through to getting a data analyst certificate where you can then apply for work,0
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for your suggestions so much,1
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for this video  Now I have a timeline to follow as I have no idea on where to start,0
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex I liked the course selection in udemy which I am following out by first studying the SQL  Excel  Tableau  Work on your projects  Will create my portfolio referring your video  later will start with Python
However I need one more suggestion if you can recommend any good udemy course for Excel dashboards and data analysis for business advanced level from tons of resources as I have spend over a decade using this tool in my career for about 10 yearsits a bread and butter for me now",1
S76iS03nGis,Are you able to pull a job with these courses,1
S76iS03nGis,Great roadmap just know that the current prices are higher,1
S76iS03nGis,Are the excel courses good for beginners,1
S76iS03nGis,Soooooo how do you feel about Treehouse tech degrees,0
S76iS03nGis,Isnt coursera better because you can audit the course and access the content for free,1
S76iS03nGis,The Analyst thank you for recommending the courses can you also suggest some courses people can take on Linkedln learning,0
S76iS03nGis,310 you forgot to mention that they give you a complete Excel Bootcamp Data analysis for free at the end  365 careersdata science are the good stuff,1
S76iS03nGis,Except python second course all are available in my personal plan which cost me around 15 per monthi know courses in personal plan are different but most are same can you make a video for courses in personal plan hope you get sponsored from udemy too for promoting personal plan i like it so far,0
S76iS03nGis,Jose Portillas courses have not been updated in at least 3 years  He even said in one course I think the Python Visualization course  that the course is no longer updated I dont know why they are still selling the courses,-1
S76iS03nGis,Just purchased the Tableau AZ hope you get your commission,0
S76iS03nGis,Hi there I noticed that The Complete SQL Bootcamp is no longer of your list of recommended SQL courses Is it not as helpful as the other two,0
S76iS03nGis,Most of Udemy courses are not worth the money regardless to the high reviews,1
S76iS03nGis,Piecharts UNFORTUNATELY,-1
S76iS03nGis,Or I can just watch YouTube to learn,0
S76iS03nGis,"So this video is not about actually for learner who want to be a data analyst instead this video is for sponsor
I also have taken one course which is not updated and also the udemy has no check and balance on courses offered by the creators",0
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex I have a very important question regarding data analytics I hope you have the time to read this and reply me solving the query Is there any particular board for data analytics Like for example if you want to become a CA there is a separate board for it So is there is any particular board for data analytics,1
S76iS03nGis,Thank you Alex This is a Curriculum I am looking for,0
S76iS03nGis,Jose is a good instructor I took his PostgreSql course,1
S76iS03nGis,Thanks a lot for this great guidance Alex,1
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex Im changing my career so last year I completed the google data analytics in coursera and python with data science online course  with project But i like do volunteer first can you please kindly suggest what i have to next And if any volunteer website if you know please kindly share Im in canada saw in google data for good website is that good to do volunteers Please kindly reply and Thank you so much,1
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex do you think chat gpt will take away data analysis jobs particularly at the entry and intermediate levels 
I have been earning data analysis for a couple of months and I have been making meteoric progress and your videos  have been focal to my learning that is why it is important for me to know your opinion on this",1
S76iS03nGis,Ive done both the SQL courses both the Excel courses and the Power BI course They are all 5 really fantastic,1
S76iS03nGis,Hey Alex would you say there is a prerequisite  amount of excel knowledge needed to taking the Advanced excel functions course,1
S76iS03nGis,do i need to have payed PowerBI or Tableau subscriptions,0
S76iS03nGis,So which one is better Udemy or cousera curriculum,1
S76iS03nGis,You have two videos recommending courses on different platforms Udemy and Coursera Which Top ones would you recommend first from either platform for SQL excel Visualisation and Python,1
S76iS03nGis,Just discovered your channel You seem like a cool knowledgeable person on this topic So im wondering if you can help me with a question i have So I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and want to instead go into Data Science industry instead of the traditional Software Developer Software Engineer career So as someone like me who eventually one day wants to work in data science industry is there an entry level job role that one can apply as a starting point and just get promoted level up to a data science in time rather than just trying to apply for a data science position from the get go I dont mind starting at the bottom and working my way up the ladder If anyone else have any suggestions i would greatly appreciate it,1
S76iS03nGis,Alex do you have financial connections to any of these courses on Udemy that youre recommending Thank you,0
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex  I have a question to you  Most people said that data analyst jobs are not entry level jobs  So if anyone wants to aim to build a career in this profession without degree is it possible,1
S76iS03nGis,Thank you Alex I just purchased the MySQL from 365careers So far so good,1
S76iS03nGis,Thanks Alex and others for the effort and guidance That last time one hour plus video was also amazing,1
S76iS03nGis,So which one is better Udemy or cousera curriculum,1
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex I appreciate you making things simpler for us  Could you please let me know the sequence of the videos to be followed for learning Excel from beginner level to pro including data analysis There are several videos of yours on it but not understanding where to begin with,0
S76iS03nGis,Maven Analytics Dustin Cabrals Tableau basic and advanced courses are much better than Krills courses Also Chris Bruehls Python courses specially Pandas and Numpy is one of the best Python courses on Udemy,1
S76iS03nGis,Would you recommend these courses over the Google Data cert Ive been trying to decide if I should go the Udemy route but the career cert has the job board when you finish Or would completing the Udemy courses be enough to find a job,0
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex thank you so much for this information Just wanted to ask you in your personal opinion which platform do you think is better for learning Data Analytics Coursera or Udemy I mean if you would have to recommend this path or the one thats covered in the video you uploaded on Coursera courses 2 weeks ago which one would you choose If you forget about money Thanks,1
S76iS03nGis,"Thanks for what you do Alex you deserve all of the success in the world for your efforts

Jose Portilla has a Python for Machine Learning  Data Science Masterclass course the first 1012 hours of which cover NumPy Pandas Matplotlib and Seaborn  It looks like this is a newer edition of the second Jose Portilla you talk about in this video  If you have experience with both courses is there a reason you recommend the one you do over the other one",1
S76iS03nGis,Still waiting for your course,0
S76iS03nGis,Youre the MVP Alex,0
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex love the channel I was lookiing at the SQL course by Careers 365 yesterday and was really interested untill i started to read the reviews it seems that they do not monitor this or respond to questions On the other hand the other hand I have taken a number of courses from Maven analitics and have been ery happy with the content and the prompt response to questions,1
S76iS03nGis,Be careful with some of those Python courses A lot of them havent been updated in years and the syntax is way out of date If you are new to Python youll probably have a hard time figuring out why your code isnt working if you are trying to follow along with the instructor Make sure to read recent reviews of all courses you are interested in buying,0
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex I do not see the prices you showed for these courses on Udemy How can I get them at those prices,0
S76iS03nGis,Do you prefer Udemy more or Coursera,1
S76iS03nGis,How much do you recommend the data analyst course by 365 careers on udemy,1
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for your excellent video I aspire to become a data analyst and always follow your videos and suggestions Unfortunately the courses you suggested are not discounted in Germany and it is pretty expensive here to take all the recommended courses,0
S76iS03nGis,This is exactly what I was looking for when I first started learning data analysis It will surely be really useful for those starting out and I will recommend it to anyone I know getting into analytics,1
S76iS03nGis,sponsered by udemy,0
S76iS03nGis,IMHO the best sql tutorial ever is Kudvenkats sql tutorial series which available for free on youtube,1
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for this list So helpful esp if you dont face bootcamp money  not sure where to start Going to wait  see if the courses go on sale again Its funny how theyre all 100 now,0
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for putting this together I love the Udemy courses Ive taken but finding the right course is kind of a nightmare on there This helped so much,1
S76iS03nGis,Dont you need some statistics in order to get a job as a data analyst,0
S76iS03nGis,Hi Alex tahnks for the guidance Regarding Python course you mentioned in the Video Can I take the Learn python for  Data Analysis and visualization without knowing anything in python do they teach me from scratch,0
S76iS03nGis,I may have to give Power BI a go because for some reason Tableau simply isnt sticking even after Kirills course Im chalking it up to selfsabotage and imposter syndrome but still,0
S76iS03nGis,Hey Alex how about R programming language Didnt see it being mentioned in your sharing,0
S76iS03nGis,Udemy has some great courses I ended up taking the 100 days of python course The first 14 days are the basics and every day has practice exercises There are a lot of projects throughout that really challenge you to learn the material Its not specific to data analytics but it was very helpful,1
S76iS03nGis,"Your the goat Alex

Thanks for sharing what made you successful",1
S76iS03nGis,The paid content you producing is crazyyy,0
S76iS03nGis,Whens the bootcamp coming,0
S76iS03nGis,coursera is better to me,1
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex awesome video and thank you  for all the info but I found out that some of this individual courses are about 100  how do I get it at this low price
Thank you",1
S76iS03nGis,Do something similar with coursera,0
S76iS03nGis,Nice that you curated these I have found Udemy to be haphazard and sorting the wheat from the chaff is too much of a chore compared to something like coursera,0
S76iS03nGis,Lets see if Ive done any of these,0
S76iS03nGis,First one to see this video,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,I am currently trying to add my projects but it isnt saving What can I do,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Can i add this to my resume but the link doesnt seems to be professional,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Its kind of a website

Bro its literally a website",1
RBEgsEVO3T8,What are the alternative to Maven for showcasing the analytics portfolio Please share the links to such alternatives or name them,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Yup I am trying out Maven Analytics,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,What is a recommened website to use to create my portfolio i am a data analyst with specilaztion in visuals power bi tabluea looker etc,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alex  Did you ever figure out why your Tableau wasnt connecting in your portfolio  I am having the same issue and havent been able to find a solution yet  Thanks,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thank you Alex for always being a solution provider on this space This video came in at the right time,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Is it free,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alex  could you discuss or touch on the stress that goes into a data analytics job Obviously there is going to be stress in virtually any field and any role but would you consider Data Analytics a stressful job I have a belowaverage tolerance for stress and was wondering if this field would be something to look into Thanks so much,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,too busy  none of the dashboards are useful in a business context nor do they convey anything easily digestible none of this applicable to a business setting i wouldnt hire this guy,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi Alex love your videos I am currently seeking a career change and  as an introvert  am wondering if data analytics if right for me

What would you think about a career in data analytics for introverts and people who prefer to work independently

Now I am fine working with people but I do my best work when working independently and its where Im happiest

Would you consider doing a video on this topic

Thank you",1
RBEgsEVO3T8,I have a question What are the chances that a job and Dan and Alex will be replaced by AI,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thank you Alex I just signed up  Checked your page to see whats new and as always I got rewarded,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,I just joined the Maven Bootcamp  Thanks for this breakdown Alex,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,I already built a portfolio with GitHub from your previous video do you think having this would also be a good idea or have either one is good enough,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,I might not be the best at internetting but i just clicked on the link above for Maven and their website is all kinds of jacked up  All other websites Ive visited tonight are normal  The Maven site is just completely off the structure is off theres no organization the pictures have no scalei mean i was looking at someones eyeball zoomed in like 10000  Its unusable right now  Has anyone else seen this tonight,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alex  Not sure if you take suggestions for videos but I was hoping for advice on getting a data analyst role with no professional experience at all  Because thats the position Im in and on top of that no degree or relevant work history  But I do have a portfolio and have won multiple data challenges Ive been applying for weeks with zero responses  Not sure where to go from here so Im open to any advice on any aspect I know its not exactly the same situation you were in but hopefully you have some insights youd be able to share  Thanks,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks for the review Alex,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alex Thanks for the review,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,I like this review and want to check it out for myself now I think a better option would be to provide a test out option for a small fee that would allow them to verify that you actually have those skills Once you pass the badge would be added,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Was desperately waiting for this because I am just going to start with the portfolio after having completed all the projects so i wanted to ask you which one is better github or maven analytics for creating a portfolio so please tell me thanks,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alex Make a video on Data analyst remote jobs that can be done from anywhere in the world Plz,0
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alexthanks for this update I just want to knowas a biginner is it OK to specify that you are in data analyse intern on your resume,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,"This is a great review Alex 

Especially appreciate the feedback you provided which I will address here 

1 Noting the additional fields as required is a great suggestion and just an oversight on our part We will update it Thanks for calling it out 

2 Adding additional skills  certificates that are nonMaven to that skills section is something weve talked about but didnt make it into this MVP launch I agree with you opening that field up would be smart Were still debating this one internally what to do how it should look how open vs prescriptive etc so cant promise quick changes But expect changes here at some point 

3 Not sure what happened with your Tableau embed attempt At first glance I cant see anything you did wrong I know this is working for other folks so need to give it a closer look Its possible there was a bug when you were trying this still a very new product or maybe I am just missing something We have this embed guide to help folks through the different embed options 



Consider this product a work in progress We love feedback like this so keep it coming",1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Its looks good but its kind of using your profile to promote their services which is not so great for a personal portfolio,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks for the info,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,You are best,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hey Alex love the review i just noticed something maybe you would like to be improved sometimes when you talk a bit louder the mic is clipping one way to deal with this is to set the mic to 6 DB at its loudest when you are recording and then use a compressor later on in post production to make it louder that way its consistent loud and clear these are my 2 cents love ya buddy keep being awesome,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks Alex,1
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Thanks Alex for sharing this  PowerBI Desktop will not work correct  it must be the service  looks super cool though
  Will definitely try it",1
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks again,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,i also had issues setting up my sql server it made me down most times,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,"thanks for sharing your experience 
do you have any tips on filters",1
gCG07l6Fu-U,The best part was hearing dont need to know all the different programs R PYTHON etc as a beginner Maybe be aware of them but not an expert Learning in chinka was also great advice too,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Hi  Alex Im interested in the projects you mentioned in healthcare Will you be able to do a video on how to do a few of these projects Thanks,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,ECU cup whaaattt,0
gCG07l6Fu-U,I know this is going to sound crazy to some people following this conversation Ive never made more than I do right now working for the county making 58K A salary of 65 doesnt sound low it sounds unattainable Im so glad I started the Google Certification for Data Analyst and then Im doing Business Intelligence too I already am an Excel power user dax powerpivot power query power BI Tableau SQL I had no idea that was marketable to other areas I need to get out of government,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Hearing about the things you had difficulty with and the ways you werent perfect when learning data analytics eased so much of my perfectionist based anxieties  Ive been kicking my butt trying to learn everything all at once and this chat was a great reminder to myself that Im doing more than enough and I should keep going and apply even when Im not ready,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Can anyone summarise the 5 points,0
gCG07l6Fu-U,Alex is amazing  Bless,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,I agree 100   Learning SQL and Actually using Microsoft SQL server Manager Studio is more challenging The student will actually encounter real errors and will need to solve the error,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,I do number 1 and 2 I also translate into my mother tongue while using the protege effect and it helps me even more,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Alex is spot on Such a great presentation These same approaches go for learning everything in tech especially building projects Sometimes we all need to be reminded to break the tutorial trap and get started,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Thanks for this Alex one question you have mentioned about automated systems checking CVs these days for that do you prefer doc version or pdf version,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Taking breaks spoke to me on a spiritual level haha Im also in the CF Data Analytics course and working on my final project I spent an hour writing a complex Python function to iterate through a large data frame and then create a new column based on seperate columns from different years in the data frame I took a break while the function was running it took close to 20 minutes to finish and during my break I realized I could just use a simple loc method to accomplish the same task much quicker and with much less memory Definitely a face palm moment but taking that extra time just to think things through while eating a snack really saved a lot of time and energy for other column changes,0
gCG07l6Fu-U,I am interested in data science and data analytics,1
gCG07l6Fu-U,Otis Paul from Uganda,0
gCG07l6Fu-U,totally agree with all your points about studying,0

DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you sir,0
DXwFsxCtukg,great video I had a question if youve completed the google data analyst certificate would it be more beneficial to follow this curriculum over the google advanced course,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Hey Alex I love your videos Im a huge fan Do I have to take all these courses at the same time,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks you you saved my live,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Hello How are you I am new to data analysis and I wonder if I should start on Google data analytic certificate or data analytic boostcamp I found one affordable boostcamp on codebasics Would you mind recommend which one should I take the course on Thank you,1
DXwFsxCtukg,The Macquarie University courses on Excel are brilliant  Also thank you for this path creating this is super useful,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Good stuff Alex,1
DXwFsxCtukg,What do you think of the PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization by the same guy as the Python course,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you so much for this video I am navigating what courses I should take after fininshing Google Data Analytics Certification courses I truly appreciate it that you are willing to share all of your knowledge skills tips that you acquired through your journey on YouTube,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Hey Alex what about courses or specializations that cover modeling such as descriptive modeling predictive and prescriptive modeling,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Hi Alex what do you think about the instructors from Maven analytics apart from Chris dutton have you tried their courses  thanks in advance,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you Alex I subscribed to Coursera Plus in Oct 2022 to make my own list of courses to become a Data analyst with a target of 6 months In my own Data analyst career transition journey I started with SQL for data science of Cdavis completed Nov22 just finished the coursework for my Google Data Analytics Certificatecompleted Feb23 and am currently working on my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics certificate   My question for you is SQL for Data science course does not teach you advanced SQL concepts Window Functions query optimizations CTE and Reg Expressions so how can I selfteach myself using Courseras catalog of Included with Coursera Plu courses I know these questions will come up in interviews,1
DXwFsxCtukg,I see the focus on Excel Do you have any recs for Google Sheets and DataLooker Studio,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Hi Alex I wanted to let you know I landed a job as an analyst using your videos,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Are you actually job ready after the google certificate or do you have to take another advanced sqlexcelpythontableau type course as well,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Which one is best This coursera ones or the ones in your udemy video,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Hello Everybody I dont recommend Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization I finished 3 first courses of this specialization and to be honest it is poorly planned the second course does not correspond with the first some topics such as PARTITION ANDWHERE inside subquery etc are not discussed at all and Mode Analytics frequently stops operating due to its 10Mb limit and creating a notebook there is a pain In the last course capstone project they discuss how to prepare data for analysis using python which wasnt covered in the course and it wasnt a prerequisite Moreover they proposed to use targz file in Databricks environment without explaining how to unpack it there by the way there is 16Tb json file inside Finally I dropped it and cancelled my specialization after completing 3 first courses Lets have a look at how the UC Devis teaches Tableau As for SQL they definitely failed,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Is there an updated discount code for Coursera Plus  Im interested in the year subscription but the discount would be fantastic  Thanks in advance,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Dear Alex thanks a lot Loved the recommendations Is there a possibility to prolong the Cousera Plus code  Its 01022023 today and I missed it,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks so much for your material and insight Its very helpful,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Would you recommend the Python 3 programming specialization and the Applied Data Science Specialization both offered by U of M,0
DXwFsxCtukg,"If money was no concern would you recommend Coursera or Udemy if you could only recommend one

Also it looks like the structure of the courses you recommend is the same across both platforms How long does it take to complete all the recommended courses on each platform",0
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you so much Alex This is very helpful,1
DXwFsxCtukg,I am now a certified junior data analyst I learned a lot from you and Luke I am grateful to both of you Really thank you so much for these great tutorialadvice and much more  And now its time to sharpen my R and Python skills,1

DXwFsxCtukg,Now  I realice is the same organizacin  Thank you,0

DXwFsxCtukg,Great video I just finished Google Data Analytics Im now focusing on projects,1
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hi Alex

I see a lot of videos regarding data analytics but I miss a video about how to track the projects
How you document what you are doing and what programs to use
Is there sort of a blueprint of the tables used ro create the queries and how the queries are connected

I think you would be the perfect person to talk about this

Best regards",1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks Alex for this video I just completed the Google Analytics certification and was looking for more courses to learn indepth Once again thanks for the guidance,1
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks for this improved roadmap My progress through Googles DA Certification actually all but came to a screeching halt the last half of the year just ended due to medicalmentaljob stuff or thats what I tell myself It really comes down to I got so tired at work due to radical schedule changes that all I wanted to do when i got home from running the cash register was divertdistract myself as well as not having any sort of accountability support structure to keep me on task but this video has helped recharge my goalseeking batteries 

I may have asked this before but do you recommend courses on StatisticsStastistical AnalysisReasoning for those of us without a CSBusiness background",0
DXwFsxCtukg,I am just finishing up with the Google Analytics course and needed some direction of where to go next This came out at the perfect time for me thanks,1

DXwFsxCtukg,"Hi Alex Once again thanks a lot for doing these videos 
I have a question that hopefully youll see Im wondering whether I should start the Data Science bachelors degree as a person with no college education Do you think it would be beneficial",1
DXwFsxCtukg,Very informative video How do you access SQL Tableau and Python while taking these courses Are there web versions available through Coursera for the different courses Thank you,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Love Alex  I could kiss that shiny bald head lol your amazing my guy 100,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you Alex I am going after all of these courses,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks for another great video Alex I noticed you mentioned taking some of these classes multiple times What motivates you to not only finish the courses but repeat them multiple times Wouldnt simply practicing the concepts on reallife problems in your job be more interesting and practical and help you learn faster,1
DXwFsxCtukg,My company just implementeed free coursera for all of their emplyees witha requirement of at least 5 of a course being finished every 2 weeks or you would have to reenroll my question is would you recommend taking any of these courses at the same time or one by one,0
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks Alex for the tips and this path to the Data Analyst job Im interested if I buy Coursera Plus for 200 will I also receive a certificate for each completed course along with a oneyear subscription and use of all courses or are the certificates additionally paid for,1

DXwFsxCtukg,Hey Alex  First of all thank you for giving us valuable content I took the Google data analyst certification and it was good it gives you the basic fundamentals of data analytics Currently Im looking forward to a more complete course  Have you ever heard of Practicum bootcamps for data analysts  my colleagues told me that it has a decent curriculum,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Would you say udemy courses are just as good as coursera or,1
DXwFsxCtukg,These are really great classes to consider Not sure if you mentioned it but one thing to consider is that not all of the courses are Coursera Plus ones so they still may charge a fee even as a Coursera Plus member  but you can always apply to Financial aid Happy Analyzing,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you so much for the recommendation I took Google Data Analytics Cert while ago there are so many DABA related courses in Coursera not sure which one I should take next This is a very good curriculum list,1

DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you for the information Great content as always Ive been doing a lot of poking around at what courses to look into following the Google Analytics Specialization to get a more indepth look at some of those concepts,1
DXwFsxCtukg,This is amazing thank you so much for the resources,1
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks for this Alex this is a very timely post I am currently going through Google Data Analytics to build on my fundamentals and Ill just follow this path Thank you so much,0

DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you Alex for the video I do have a question to askI took one Python class from IBM on Coursera  I dislike their teaching style Therefore I am looking for other Coursera classes as replacements Here are my questions 

1 Can this class Applied Plotting Charting  Data Representation in Python by the University of Michigan on Coursera replace the IBM Data Visualization class in your video 

2  Can this class Introduction to Data Science in Python by the University of Michigan on Coursera serves as a replacement for the IBM Data Analysis class in your video This class from the U of Michigan is teaching Pandas  which I assume its for Data Analysis 

Thank you very much Alex",0
DXwFsxCtukg,Think you Alex for your knowledge share but I want to know if its obligate to take the courses in order you mention them,0
DXwFsxCtukg,"This is a great resource thank you If you had to break down what percentage a typical data analyst might actually use each application what would you say  
50 Excel  20 SQL  20 Python or R  10 Tableau or Power BI",1
DXwFsxCtukg,This is cool  I got my certificate June 2022 now Im looking for data Analyst rolealso saved ur videos its really helped me lotsthank u for ur time,1

I know this tutorial for beginners but anyway Id like to comment that theres a better approach to the ifelifelifelif code commonly known as arrow antipattern in this case
Having a reference table as the source for the logic allows possible future changes eg if the IBM values change for some reason WITHOUT having to change the logic of the code only the data contained in the table would be modified in that case

Something like this

reftable      00  a feather 
                185  underweight  
                249  normal weight

                394  obese 
                399  severely obeese 
                999  morbidly obese

bVJfQAe-UP4,"Hey Alex

You provide a ton of values for hundreds and thousands of people 

I am 39 with 3 kids make great steady paycheck as a country manager but been playing around with SQL and I kinda like it

What is your honest opinion if I were to seriously learn Data Analysis for the next 812 months start taking single freelance jobs and after getting the hang of it start my own small data analytics constulting shop Too late Too risky

Have the network in various companies across industries through my career

Really tired of working for  tech startup founders andor dealing with HR stuff for the past 15 years

_2OknmkngkQ,I agree with one of your viewers the Target Data Analyst in that learning a new domain is the hardest part of changing careers to data analytics Im in manufacturing value chain analytics using SAP and I know nothing about manufacturing or value chain whatsoever I can get the tech part SAP of the job quickly because the Internet is full of educational content but there are not value chain or manufacturing crash courses out there Im learning on the job and I feel so behind the curve,1

_2OknmkngkQ,"Such a good point on companies being super behind on tech This could honestly be a video all on its own

Ive seen some reports that go to people super high up that are still in excel with like pivots and excel charts because thats what people are comfortable with 

And Ive made solutions for teams that couldnt figure out how to make a few simple formulas in excel",1

zvzjaqMBEso,Alex thank you so much about 3 years ago I bought on line some python courses and never was able to understand the basics of them  and now with this boot camp I  do understand a lot more and finally I am retaking those courses you really have a talent to explain all this stuff Thanks,1

zvzjaqMBEso,Hello alex  thanks for your course and i  have a doubt well this much python is ok or is there anything else to learn to become data analyst,1
zvzjaqMBEso,Done,0
zvzjaqMBEso,Youre python tutorials are so easy to understand and informative I appreciate these videos as they are aiding me while I take coding classes in college,1
zvzjaqMBEso,Python coding has absolutely put me off trying to be a data analyst lol I give up,1
zvzjaqMBEso,Good but very basic Dont you have any more indepth course on python,1
zvzjaqMBEso,Functions and loops always pissed me off but your courses are amazing and I cleared these topics easily Thanks a lot Alex,1
zvzjaqMBEso,This made very little sense Why would you do any of this TALK ABOUT ARBITRARY And how is anyone meant to remember this,-1
zvzjaqMBEso,"What i like about your channels is that you show us if and when you run into errors
Showing that they are normal and we should not feel bad when encountering them",-1
zvzjaqMBEso,How are arbitrary arguments different to pointers in other languages like C,0
zvzjaqMBEso,Hello Alex Thanks alot for these videos When do we get a playlist on how to carry out a full data analysis with python,1
zvzjaqMBEso,"use return instead of print
print inside function returns NoneType",0
zvzjaqMBEso,AwesomeGreat content indeed By the way I expected few videos on pandas  numpy mathplotlib as wellAs they  also primarily need for data analysis,0
zvzjaqMBEso,At 631 is the function essentially skipping anything other than 5  6 from the tuple Im assuming number0 and number1 is referring to the item that matches that index in the tuple,0
zvzjaqMBEso,Great video Alex but theres something I didnt fully understand Whats the difference between using args and kwargs In which context would you use one or the other one  Thanks and keep up the grat work,1
zvzjaqMBEso,Keep up the great knowledge,1

ECduJk00mUU,I dont know why you keep showing tutorials with numbers as examples Not everyone is Stephen Hawking Just tell me that  I can make the user enter a bloody password  otherwise keep telling them to enter it in a loop if the pass is wrong  Thank you for your efforts,-1
ECduJk00mUU,Che aura,0
ECduJk00mUU,"The continue function is hard to comprehend for me but the way I currently understand it is that it resets to the beginning of our while loop

So on my machine I have the following code

number  0

while number  5 
    number  number 1
    if number  3
        continue
        printnumber
else 
    printNo Longer 5

and the result is the following

No Longer 5

My explanation for this result is that our number goes through our while loop as 0 gets 1 isnt 3 then repeats
1  1 isnt 3 so it repeats 21 is 3 so then we get to the continue function and instead of printing any number the continue function sends us back up to the beginning of our loop so 31 becomes 4 and then 41 is NO LONGER 5 so weve completed the entire while loop statement and then the else statement is read So we only see the else statement actually printed",0
ECduJk00mUU,For the while loop where we are using continue when we hit continue why did we restart the while loop vs the second example we actually continued to the next line to print it,0
ECduJk00mUU,,0
ECduJk00mUU,,0
ECduJk00mUU,156 You can also use number  1 as that is the same as number  number  1,0

ECduJk00mUU,Thank you sir,0
ECduJk00mUU,Hey Alex thanks for your videos I am a bit confused about  this one though so when number is 0 and you say number1 isnt it supposed to start with a 1 directly skipping the 0,0
ECduJk00mUU,Hey Alex thank you for introducing me to this interesting world of data,1
ECduJk00mUU,Hi Alex thanks the useful contents as always I also wanted to ask if one of your next tutorial series could be about the financeeconomic concepts required for a data analyst job  It seems an important subject especially for people like me who come from a different field but I havent seen a data analyst channel or an online resource focusing on that aspect,1

zmIdC0_0BgY,With no real experience with Python as a use case in the Healthcare industry would  you nest for loop a diagnosis and cpt codes commonly associated with the diagnosis then compare what was in   or not in     I guess you could then compare what doctors then usually do what procedures on a diagnosis  BTW is that something an analyst or scientist be more likely to do Thanks for breaking this down to the Nub3 level,0

eP8-mo5jRrY,I would like to know how completing a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating your skills and knowledge is going to equate to 5 years experience because no one hires anyone in this field with less than 5 years experience They only look at senior level candidates for any of these types of positions I have been 2 years trying to get a paid position and cant even have a conversation with anyone because I dont have enough work experience Why would anyone go into such a field when there is no opportunity  I get calls all day long from recruiters and it is the same old thing you dont have enough work experience or we need this skill or experience in this particular industry etc It is a waste of time,0

I am currently analysing an employees layoff dataset available on kaggle It has 1574 records and 9 columns one of the columns name Totallaidoff how many employees were laid off from the organisationdatatype Int it has 442 records with missing values what should I do in this case to treat the missing values should I replace them with median value or shall I drop missing values from the dataset
I have a similar question for another column name percentage of employees laid off percentage of employees fired out of the total workforce in this case also shall I replace 552 missing values with the median percentage value
What could be the best course of action
I personally thought I should replace the missing values with median values because dropping so many rows would result in a good amount of loss of information",1

ppsCxnNm-JI,"Tons of material covered in this video it took me about 2 hours to cover the material while following along and adding notes 

In my first job interview for a decision scientist role one of my interviewers asked me using python to merge 2 datasets and I blanked 

Just after listening to your video I could have explained that if we have the data were merging together and its all the same data type we could just call each data set and use the  character to combine those values and return only the unique ones 

However and I think youll cover this in your PANDAS series they probably wanted me to explain how to call PANDAS and use the merge function which I havent learned how to do it yet but I will as I progress through your videos",1

However theres something in this lesson thats left me a little puzzled 

I hope you or anyone out there would be kind enough to help out 


So when you did the basic 

a6  it returned W

a25  returned llo

However a26  returns 
llo  including space

a27  returns llo W

So Im curious as to why the position number of W has changed from 6 to 7

WUeBzT43JyY,"Hey Alex
Love your videos by the way Theyve helped me tremendously with my first data analysis projects Quick question If I already have Python installed on my system should I remove it before installing Anaconda Ive read mixed reviews as to whether its recommended or not Im just worried about running into errors since I have Python already installed and it is in my PATH variables But also would it be best practice anyway to save on storage by uninstalling the original Python before installing Anaconda 

Thanks for taking the time to read this I look forward to your response",1
WUeBzT43JyY,thank you  I wanted to ask what is the effect of you checking Register anaconda3 as my default Python 39 Im not sure how this affects the running of other IDEs like Spyder pycharm etc for example What does it mean autiomatically detect anaconda as my primary python 3 thanks,0

3NV5Jtbhfcw,Argument in favor of piedonut charts They are good for demonstrating the relationship of a category to the total Bar charts are good for My top seller is about double the next highest but a pie chart is better for My top seller is about 13 of all sales You might argue that thats what stacked bar charts are for but those arent very engaging if you only have a single bar,1

1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thank you so much Alex I have one question As I am gathering my portfolio with projects now trying to display versatility with different types of projects do you think it matters what projects you are displaying in your portfolio based on the industry you are applying to For example I have a covid based project do you think applying to sports jobs would be relevant to show I know having sports projects would be ideal but as you know we cant spend our entire time developing projects for every industry 

Keep up the great work",1

1cfrQLoJMPI,Hi Alex your channel and content is top notch thank you so much for all the valuable information you provide,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,Hi Alex Since you asked  I liked your other videos better The lamp on the top right is distracting the shelf on the left is not framing a video well either The little microphone you had in older videos seemed really cool Just my two cents,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts on these guided projects

I have been subscribed to Coursera Plus since May I really like most of their guided projects

When I saw this video 4 hours ago I immediately did the Power BI for HR Analytics After finishing it I also did the Income Statement  Balance Sheet with that same instructor That 2nd course also includes 2 optional dashboard projects

So in a little less than 2 hours I created not 2 but 4 PBI dashboards and have also downloaded his data sets

Id HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who wants to further build their portfolio  like yours truly 

 The instructor for these PBI projects also encourages the student to log in their emails using their cloud desktop so that you can submit those exact projects to potential employers clients",0

1cfrQLoJMPI,I just began the transition into Data and Im super excited your content has been very insightful,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,You ROCK THANK YOU SOOO MUCH I am on my analytics 8 class course working on the Capstone project right now and while I feel like I have gotten a fairly intermediate exposure to multiple platforms I am at a loss getting started with this I cannot see the clear picture of what I am supposed to be doing But I think that if I do this first it will give me a ton of insight into how this process should work I do realize that everyone is different and their processes will not always follow the same reasoning and also that this is a way for others to get a glimpse into your way of thinking process per se but I think this will be SO HELPFUL so again THANK YOUUUUU,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,Hi Alex do u know of any  free guided project on coursera using excel or google sheets,1

1cfrQLoJMPI,Alex All the Guided portfolio projects dont have financial aid attached to them on Coursera Should I finish a certification before getting one for these,0

1cfrQLoJMPI,I pay for a monthly sub to Coursera but they wanted payment for the Tableau guided project anyway Is Coursera an additional charge,0
1cfrQLoJMPI,I really appreciate all the content you post on this subject it has been instrumental in me seeking a possible career change I was wondering if you or anyone could provide any insight as to how attenable is it to get a job read in 3 or so months A quick background about me I am a medical school grad but didnt complete residency to work as an MD So I took the IT support course on Coursea and really enjoyed it and have been learning python for maybe 3 weeks now and I would like to jump into the tech world to find a job And before I decide what steps to follow next I do want honest feedback as to what are the chances of someone with my background to actually make it into this industry Any feedback would be greatly appreciated,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,super cool  helpful,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thanks for the suggestions Alex Are there any Guided Portfolio projects you recommend for those working through the Google Data Analytics Certification I know you have a few on your channel but are there any you recommend from Coursera I see the few you mentioned here use Python whereas the Google DA program uses R so if theres any that use R do let me know As for Python I want to learn that as well after completing the Google DA program Is there a Coursera course you recommend Sorry for the long winded comment and questions,-1
1cfrQLoJMPI,Video and sound are both crisp Alex  Not gonna lie missing the snake plant in the background  Please ask your wife the name of the plant on the shelf  looks like a type of lilly  but I cant tell And yes I also paid attention to your words in the foreground,1

1cfrQLoJMPI,You inspired me to start my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate I am glad I found your channel,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,The KPI one only includes up to 2021 data so the lesson is a little outdated and some calculations wont work the same way as she is showing so watch out for that everyone Maybe follow along with her first to get an idea but make your own hybrid project,0
1cfrQLoJMPI,Holy moly Alex the quality just sky rocketed on your vids Audio is crisp and video looks astounding BTW currently on the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate I went my own route with a dataset i chose and i gotta tell ya its hard but feels rewarding since its noth another cyclistic or bellabeat project Hoping to finish soon,1
1cfrQLoJMPI,Can you recommend more projects that involve KPIs I see a lot of job listings in my area where they require experience in working with them and I hope that these projects might help with some hands on experience,1

0QZBnhofU_U,Thank you it is a great start for me One problem I got is the download is for 32 bit and my pc is 64 bit any solution,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Is the discount valid only when you pay upfront,0
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex
How valuable is the certificate",0
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex 
I watched this and it really helped but then I found Springboard data analytics bootcamp and it is pretty comparable to CF except it also includes Power BI though seems less focused on Python Its more expensive and is shorter Do you have any thoughts about specifically these two bootcamps",0
0QZBnhofU_U,Is the program beginner friendly Someone with zero knowledge,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Would you recommend for a business analyst role,0
0QZBnhofU_U,The have to be willing to relocate is a shitty cop out on their part,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex Im trying to join CareerFoundry and when I mentioned the discount they said is expired only until 2022,0
0QZBnhofU_U,If you guys want to buy it let me know I already have it and they have a promotion that you get 500 per referral for both So just let me know,0
0QZBnhofU_U,"Save yourself the money and time with this school Too much fluff SO much reading and the tutors are article happy  All of my suggestions to the school were pretty much ignored 

Dont waste your time and just use Alexs resources and other free ones you find online",1
0QZBnhofU_U,Just seeing this vid Whats the likelihood of another discount coming through Looking to start the full course this fall,1
0QZBnhofU_U,How much would a entry level make with the job guarantee in this program,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Sir What do you think about masterschool No money until someone get hired I really dont know thats really work  please make a about it,1
0QZBnhofU_U,What is your opinion of the Springboard bootcamp Thanks,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Anyone complete the course and have a good experience landing a job,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Do you suggest this Bootcamp to someone his English level is intermediate My idea is to improve confidence and speaking,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex Thanks for the review Very informative Is the 20 off still valid Thank you,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Thank you for the review Im doing the free course right now and searched for reviews to make sure I wasnt getting into something that was useless The only other time I had looked into a bootcamp I was disheartened at the price I am thankful the introductory course is available foran easy price because it will take more than the free part for me to decide to shell out several thousand dollars for this  I am dipping my toe into finding another career and data analytics keeps coming up  Unfortunately based on a brief search locally I dont think I will be able to replace my current income but I figure pursuing the skills will still be fruitful  I was wondering how much prior knowledge of SQL python or other languages might I need,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex I am currently an international students in Syd Aus I wanna ask whether this bootcamp can have job guarantee as DA in Australia if i dont have citizenship yet,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Hey Alex Im a recent grad at the University of Michigan Im equipped with a bachelors in economics and minor in entrepreneurship as well as elementary programming concepts covered in some of my firstyear courses and more advanced statistics and econometrics courses I want to land a job in data analytics but have found myself scrolling thru jobs that require a couple of years of industry experience which has brought my career to a halt Any advice,1
0QZBnhofU_U,How long will the discount last Im in the process of moving countries and not sure how long till I get settled with all legal stuff,0
0QZBnhofU_U,you sound pretty biased stopped watching after 10 mins,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Are there any good places to buy just the mentorship I feel like I can learn most of the technical skills on my own but I really need to find a mentor I would rather be able to just pay to consult with a mentor a few times per month,1
0QZBnhofU_U,How would you compare it with General Assembly Data Science Immersive,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Make investments in yourself I am starting this boot camp as well,0
0QZBnhofU_U,does this bootcamp offer access to the programs like do I need to have tableu or excel,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Outside of the mentorship and the tutor aspect of the course  How does this course stack up against  the Googles DA course though Coursera,0
0QZBnhofU_U,I would say data camp is more appealing to me they cover projects they teach every important skills required and make you practice as wellfrom excel to MLthat too in just 25 per month,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Great work really was looking for something that I can get mentorship with and this sounds like a good deal to me,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex are there other ways to get the mentorship without a bootcamp,-1
0QZBnhofU_U,You lost me at 7000 Im from Africa,0
0QZBnhofU_U,bootcamps are irrelevant at this pointway too many resources available these days,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Alex if you the Master data analyst made a 70 on the test then this doesnt bode well for the rest of us,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex I just want to say THANK YOU and to tell you how much I appreciate your content Your tutorials portfolio series and interview tips have helped me so much to finally land my dream job as a Business Intelligence Analyst Thank you,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Waiting for Masters Programs in Business Analytics Data Analytics in USA,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex interesting I actually subscribed CF Channel before l would be interested if the cost can be lower,1
0QZBnhofU_U,"Year ago you made a video about 
Bootcamp is a waste of money and
Today you are advising people to do it
Come on Alex We like your videos but dont be greedy",-1
0QZBnhofU_U,"Its USD 5500 
Thats expensive",-1
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex I would love to see how your review  of World Quant University Applied Data Science Lab,1
0QZBnhofU_U,The stipulations of the money back guarantee are a bit sketchy IMHO They can find you a job paying 40k extremely underpaid and if you decline  boom there goes your money back perk,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Meh Im just not convinced It just seems like an expensive supergoogle data analytics course I dont see how well this course will prepare anyone for building portfolio projects and that type of experience is what we need to show potential employers since many of us will not have experience or background as a data analyst This just feels like  a teach yourself bootcamp service Everything I have seen can be learned online for free in under a year as well if one were so inclined,0
0QZBnhofU_U,"I dont know what to say about the job guarantee
It says on their site that if you are offered work that is at least 15 hours a week that it qualifies as a job offer  Essentially part time with little hours  I feel like people that take those kind of offers just wont be valued as much by their companies  
Also since its 15 hours does that also include freelance and contractor work  Data analytics is such a broad term that I wonder if the guarantee actually covers real data analysis positions",0
0QZBnhofU_U,Happy to see this after seeing your other thoughts on bootcamps Im partway through acheivement 3 in the data immersion course with CareerFoundry So far so good,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Ive been looking to make the switch from pursing a careergrad school in Physical Therapy but have always been hesitant to sign up for a boot camp This one is definitely one of the best Ive seen thus far and Ill look more into it Seems like a solid price for what youre getting too,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Love your content I find a lot of inspiration and value in your content  Cheers,1
0QZBnhofU_U,Ill definitely look further into this program Im glad the job gurantee specifies a job related to data analytics a lot of bootcamps just gurantee for any job whether coding related or not so that alone gives this one a step up,0
0QZBnhofU_U,Wow this sounds realty great I wish I knew about this before the google program This isnt currently in my budget,1
0QZBnhofU_U,So the job guarantee only applies if you live in the US,0
0QZBnhofU_U,You lost me at sponsor of this video CareerFoundry lol,1
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hey Alex
Hope you are doing Great  Is the Job gaurantee is for whole world or for only US based Citizenship Because i dont want to end up like Google Data Analytics Certificate which says its only for US based citizenship 
Thanks",1
0QZBnhofU_U,First time seeing a 22 minute long advertisement,0
0QZBnhofU_U,So Im about 75 done with the Google Data Analytics Certificate Does CF go much deeper into the skills where it would be worth it to enroll after the certificate course or is there too much crossover,1
0QZBnhofU_U,I started watching your videos 6 months ago working in a warehouse and now im a junior data analyst,0
0QZBnhofU_U,I am currently doing this course It has been a fantasticseamless process so far Im 2 months in and the mentortutor support is amazing I would recommend this course to anybody looking to get into a Data Analytics fast track career course Will keep this community up to date when I finish and get a my first job   Billy Fowler II,1

ulFY20KTzFQ,compeleted 12 December,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,there is no option here to not Summarize,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Why does my PowerBI default the title to Sum of Price by Store Product and Product when yours just defaults to Price by Store and Product Similarly my Yaxis defaults to Sum of Price and yours defaults to just Price,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Please please highlight your cursor so it can be seen what you are pointing at  some us do not have good sight to follow the tiny cursor  thank you,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,thanks,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,Hey When I download the data I do not see the purchase tracker table in it,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,I find people do NOT want to drill down  They rather want a tab at each level where they have filters they can set that vary by level  When I do drill down people always say can you just make that level as a tab where I can have controls at that level  Total sub total then sub sub total it always seems better than drilling into the different levels  The key is the filters change at the lower levels and you simply gain more filters  This seems to be WAY more intuitive and I never get requests for drill when people see the levels on tabs  If the records are not massive I can have the last tab be full detail so people can do anything on their own in some other tool with the raw data,1

ulFY20KTzFQ,Nice but shallow I would like to see more complex things Like grid with few aggregations eg 3 cols and drill down to show all unique details under it eg 10 cols,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Excellent,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,I really see the value of using drill downsaves time and space dont have to do as many separate visualizations As always THANK YOU ALEX,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,Is it possible to drill down in a Table visual or does it have to be a histogram,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,How can it be that your bars are always sorted in descending order,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,I get count of customer and sum of price when I drag customer and price in Yaxis How can I just insert customer and price,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you for this I have a question though What does this legend mean exactly when creating charts because i noticed that once you drag an item to the legend it displays in differ colours,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Very useful Thanks,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you so much for that you really made efforts for us,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,"For those who have the updated PowerBI version here is what you need to do in order to see the visualization in the order that is shown in this video
Go to the three dots on the frame of the visualization  Price  Sort Descending and unmark the Sort Legend Now it is ordered correctly
On why it writes Sum of Price its probably because of an Update for PowerBI Desktop Version For that you can just rename it Price on the field itself It has the same data",0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Can drill down be applied to other tables For example in this video the Apocalypse Sales and Purchase Tracker tables dont have any relationship I want to drill down for Units Sold in each product for each store the the Units Sold column is in another table Does drill down can still be applied even if the next level is on the other table and the first level is on another different table,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,152 Hey Alex Sir In my case whenever I drag down Product option in xaxis it is by default drilled down even though Ive tried to do it multiple times Is it because of the updated version of Power Bi that Ive installed from Microsoft Store or it could be something else Please help,-1

ulFY20KTzFQ,Hey Alex Loving this series but have a question Whenever I click drag one of the fields  it renames  it into Sum of field name This happened in the DAX video as well How can I change this,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,i keep getting sum of price in the visualizations instead of just the price values please how do i fix this,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,It is easy for data analysts to control the drill down but business users always gets confused about it,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you,0
ulFY20KTzFQ,DAX made me sadbut Drill Down in Power BI seems more straight forward and quick than Tab,1
ulFY20KTzFQ,So when I create the second graph when I go down one level the name of the customer stays on the label along side the order ID instead of just showing the Order ID Does anyone else have this issue If so could you fix it,0

vcijg0gUXSg,"Thank you so much Alex This is a job well done I am learning so fast through you
For those having issues with the iteration explanation made by Alex here is a brief description of how I understand it using the DAX expression that worked for me

SUMXApocolypse SalesApocolypse SalesSumofProductsSold  Apocolypse StoreProfitPerProduct

SUMXApocolypse SalesApocolypse SalesSumofProductsSold  This is the first part of the formular and what this part does is to establish the iterator which is the SumofProductsSold from the Apocolupse Sales table This iterator becomes a constant that is applied to each row of the ProfitPerProduct column in the Apocolypse Store table So for each row of the ProfitPerProduct column in the Apocolypse store table the multiplicator factor is applied using the iterator constant which in this case is 3001

 Apocolypse StoreProfitPerProduct represents the column whose individual rows are to be multiplied by the iterator constant

SUMx tells the iterator constant to go row by row for the defined column

NB Here is the formular for TotalProfitPerProduct  Apocolypse StoreProfitPerProduct  SUMApocolypse SalesUnits Sold

On to the main point I think you might have made some mistakes with the SUM and SUMX while calculating the profit for each product as well as the table for the amount of profit each customer has made you in the reports section 

1  For the Profit column in the Apocalypse Store table consider using the DAX Function Apocolypse StorePriceApocolypse StoreProduction Cost  Units Sold Where the Units Sold in the DAX function is a measure that contains the DAX function SUMApocolypse SalesUnits Sold 

2  As for the table that contains the profit earned from each customer I suggest you try the DAX function SUMXApocolypse Sales Apocolypse SalesUnits Sold  RELATEDApocolypse StorePrice  RELATEDApocolypse StoreProduction Cost which returns the correct profits earned from each customer

It took me a few hours to figure out since Im relatively new to Microsoft Power BI If anyone sees this comment let me know if this works for you",1
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hey Alex I was doing the math and the value of the profit per item is WRONG It is multiplying price  cost of the product 10001 by the total of units sold 3001 therefore the value of 59k of profit The corret value is multiplied by 390 Total amount sold of the item 10001 which result a total of 67548

gCg47n_TlFc,I think your analysis is not very accurate all data shows that senior tech employees are bouncing back to employment faster if they want what companies are stopping now is new projects which historically are those who would bring newcomers to the space and this is unlikely to change,-1
gCg47n_TlFc,I have a small tech company and we have worked remote ever since coronavirus I understand the employee position but theres also something you are not seeing as employees While a lot of employees can perform remotely not every employee can perform remotely I have employees who lower their performance ever since working remotely People say well fire them  but its not easy because its not easy to replace them and they now it i have always treated my employees with respect and dignity and treated them fairly during coronavirus i did not fire ANY employee at all and even when had 0 income for months and months i only lowered their salary for about 4 months or so and after that full salary again But what they did in exchange They became less loyal actually having more than one job and underperforming I have eventually managed to keep the good ones but my point is NOT EVERY COMPANY is evil and yet we are all getting treated like we are to blame for the employees misery I just think theres always going to be people whi will do the least effort possible and trick the system if not supervised and theres also tech  projects which are not all software based Who will you work in Research and development of new materials batteries etc etc from home  There are many tech areas where you NEED to be at the office or else there wont be any breakthroughs or real testing,0

I have an MIS degree which is not the same as a computer science degree so I was having a hard time being selected for interviews since I wasnt fluent in programming languages I found your channel sometime during my second week of my layoff and started looking into business analyst roles I was a sales person that worked his way up to the VP I never had a business analyst job but of course I had done a lot of analysis type of work

gCg47n_TlFc,All of this below conversation makes me think of another very controversial issue As a data professional how political is your job How much does the managements ideology affect how you present the data How does your own ideology affect how you present the data Were you ever asked to sort of cook the numbers or misrepresent them as we see the Biden administration do on social media every day Cmon peeps if you are basically numerate and you understand data you see what is happening Or maybe you dont Maybe you are naive or not numerate just use Python and SQL and dont understand anything about how the world operates either Not everyone majored in math econ public policy etc Maybe they dont know what the hell theyre doing in the data world,1

gCg47n_TlFc,"Hi Alex thanks for your informative helpful videos and this discussion on these trying times Im trying to become an analyst as a recent graduate MS in Applied Math and I just wanted to share an experience I had around 4 months ago

I was referred to a relatively large at the time 20B market cap tech company by a friend I excitedly interviewed did quite well and waited to hear back Six days passed and each day their stock price was getting demolished

On the seventh day since my interview I received an email saying the position was already filledThanks for your interest My friend despite being told to tell no one mentions to me that I did not receive a subsequent interview because the position was actually removed due to the companys recent performance valued then at 7B

gCg47n_TlFc,"Even though I shored up my resume by taking a Tableau Analytics course through Emory University when my job got outsourced in September of 2021 I havent been able to buy a job  Every entry level position wants you to have a BS in Engineering Computer Science Economics etc preferably a Masters know Tableau AND Power BI expert in DAX along with Python AND R SAS or some other statistical package Snowflake data modeling data warehouse data lakes and whatever industry proprietary packageall of this with 2 to 5 years experience  Oh and you need to be able to do regression modeling as well  All Im thinking is this unicorn already has a job and if they dont theyre not looking for an entry level position  It really has gotten completely out of control with what these companies expect out of an entry level candidate to the point where people like me someone who knew SQL Alteryx Pivot Tables regular and Power and Power Query BEFORE I took Tableau Analytics cant smell a job and yes Im on linkedin  No one told me I needed a portfolio so Im working on that but I still cant find a job

As far as people working from home I come from the CocaCola family of companies and worked on their campus  I get why they want people to come in a couple of times a week  Home Depot requires that most of their employees come into the office a couple of times a week If you think about it a lot of people eventually lost their jobs and cant find work because corporate workers began to telecommute 5 days a week  The people who work in the cafeteria the custodial company lost their contract and had to let their crews go a lot of the security people lost their jobs the media specialists who ran the town hall meetings got laid off the receptionists around the campus the data quality people who ran producttesting the maintenance people who are now down to the bare bone and on and on and on  You could make the argument that they shouldve gone to college and learned blah blah blah but we were glad they were there when we came into the office a couple of times a week 

I guess what Im saying is that the world doesnt just revolve around people who can work from home  Other people can also be negatively affected by those choices none of which helps the economy",1

gCg47n_TlFc,Heres the thing about the Great Resignation there isnt a one size fits all reason for why people resigned But to be honest people got to a point where they rethought their philosophy on work and for the first time in my lifetime companies have finally been forced to revisit this out of necessity For once companies have had a hard time filling positions and were forced to address pay time off quality of life worklife balance etc Its about effing time You cited a whole host of excellent reasons for which this was necessary We spend such a disproportionate  of our lives at work Shouldnt it be livable And should we really have to adjust every aspect of our lives around work Im not saying work should be 2000 unicorns and rainbows but in many workplaces its been the polar opposite until now and that could be the reason for the outsized response,1

gCg47n_TlFc,"These lay offs dont really matter because there are other tech companies willing to pick up the laid off employees Tech is doing great overall FAANG giants are just doing bad because their senior staff all left Current leadership thinks new hires can replace the old but thats simply not how things work in this industry The giants have hundreds of new hires just sitting on the bench getting paid to do nothing I know because Im one of them

After they do these mass layoffs theyre going to find that the quit rate remains elevated theyre going to quickly lack bodies again and theyre going to wind up right back in the same position

4nsdARJGzJ0,"I just finished week one of this course There is definitely some math If youre like me and its been a minute since youve really had to work through an equation I would advise just slowing down and making sure you understand what youre looking at before moving on because each step builds on the last 

Andrew Ng is a very good teacher which is what makes the class work ChatGPT is also good as an echo chamber Try to explain the math to it it will correct you if you get something wrong",1

I have only simple enquiry as a new sql learner
I havent made my mind yet whether to use sql server or not 
Is sql server the best solution available for those who want to manage and automate databases inside a medium size company
Is there any alternative i need to consider right from the beginning or any applications that is relevant to integrate with the database being used
I consider myself a machine learning enthusiast and and would mostly like to automate business solutions with the engine being used
Thanks for taking time to read this God bless you",1
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hi Alex and everyone 
Pls I need help on how to upload my certificate from Coursera to Upwork Ive tried but Coursera is not among the list of options in the certification Thank you all",0
4nsdARJGzJ0,Hi Alex are you related to the guy who runs chart explorer YouTube channel Its about Data Analytics and you guys look like twins,0
4nsdARJGzJ0,Off topic question Please answer How important is it to know statistics for data analyst And if it is very important what would you recommend to learn STATA R STUDIO or anything else really I am just stuck in regression and correlation I mean I understand how it works but when you have a really big data manual calculation is not the best way Just wanna know your opinion on this Thank you,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,it reminds me to Joshua Starmer,0
4nsdARJGzJ0,Hey Alex I have completed this course 3 months back Is it worth to take it up again Although I know R and dont know Python,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,Hi Alex I really hope that you can see this comment I really appreaciate all of your amazing works so far It is really helpful Can you suggest any kind of other sources like books or podcads to have a mindset in data analytics Because I struggle with which questions to ask rather than which tools and how the codes are written Thank you so much for that you are such an amazing man,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hey Alex
Thank you for the great review Is this specialization available only in specific regions The link is not working for me",1

4nsdARJGzJ0,How much money it cost to learn machine learning course from Coursera,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,Thanks Alex for a great review as always Please whats the cost of this program,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,Thanks for sharing this I was looking for a good ML course and this is exactly the suggestion I needed,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,So happy my college actually teaches machine learning in the DA program So interesting,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,Really glad to see this channel branch out into different fields of analytics ML knowledge is really valuable to have especially when it is displayed as a portfolio project on a resume,1
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hey Alex I just landed a Data Analyst internship for the summer and I am really looking forward to it Your channel has definitely helped me out 

I am looking forward to taking this machine learning specialization as well Im planning out when to commit the time to study Work will take up so much of my time in the day",1
4nsdARJGzJ0,I have a doubt   since it is called us Deep learningai is it just all about deep learning or it starts from scratch of ML to Deep learningof should i do someother machine learning course before taking this please help me,0
4nsdARJGzJ0,I just found your page and Im in the process of watching all of your videos I just accepted a position of a administrative analyst and I like it so far but I cant find much about others in this position I dont get paid much 17but Im okay with that for now because Im entry and graduated with a BS in community health in 2020 and went from a screenerto medical records to my current position at the same clinic location Where should I start to leverage on my new position of administrative analyst Im so sorry for the long comment and grammar but Im searching for a sense of direction I desperately want to take this small opportunity and grow and Im afraid that I might because stagnant 2020 really did a number on my confidence in job hunting and how Im perceived in the market because I was constantly turned down and overlook for things I felt like I was qualified for,0
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Thanks for the review
Is the course also useful for ppl who are more into data analytics",1
4nsdARJGzJ0,Sad that I have to pay for the specialisation because it is not included in my unis partnership programme with Coursera but I think the fee will be worth it  Thanks for reminding us of Andrew Ng using Python for ML Alex,0
4nsdARJGzJ0,Alex great video as usual  Question for you how do you balance work with your studies and side hustle Whats your schedule look like on a weekly basis  Im trying to make changes to my weekly habit to be more efficient  Would love to hear from you Thank you,1

_QvQxm4dptI,thanks for the video Could you please give me a hint I am currently working as a seo specialist and I have a desire to develop further in marketing to eventually come to marketing operations Is this course going to help me get closer to that goal or should I just take a digital marketing course,0
_QvQxm4dptI,please make review about the update since they add 2 course into it with python course,0
_QvQxm4dptI,Do I need to know about coding to learn this course I mean what if I have no knowledge right off the bat,0
_QvQxm4dptI,They have updated this certificate since your last review Theyve added a dedicated SQL and Python course,0
_QvQxm4dptI,"It seems they updated the course 
2 new sections were added 
1 Data Analysis with Spreadsheets and SQL  25 hours
2 Python Data Analytics  25 hours

The total time to completion increased to 7 months at 10 hours a week",0
_QvQxm4dptI,very arrogant and full of personal biases all over it,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Great review  feedback Alex 

I myself am a data analyst who used to be a digital marketer  traditional marketer

This entire Coursera Specialization is highly geared ONLY  as Alex already stated for those wanting to be in the Marketing Analytics space Id also like to add a few things

1 Even if youre a generic or non marketing analyst having digital marketing skills is still a good add on or even as a part time  side hustle 

2 For this like me going into Marketing Analytics this entire specialization gives you a FREE VOUCHER for the META certification exams 


Good luck everyone",1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hello
I am from Bangladesh anyway I would like to know if I did IBM Data analytics certification then I could pass meta marketing analytics certification exam
If so I will opt for IBM Data analytics certification
Please tell me about it",0
_QvQxm4dptI,This review was not helpful It had your personal biases all over it,0
_QvQxm4dptI,I really loved the course 3 of this certificate I absolutely didnt feel any inconvenience about a bit dark background of the instructor his manner of presenting the material was quite good and the content itself seemed great to me This course sparked my interest for statistics and motivated me to take an indepth statistics course Actually Google Analytics certificate is missing statistics completely Im right now in the last course of it and in my opinion it is hard to do a thorough and indepth  analysis of data without the knowledge of statistics So I would really recommend course 3 to those who have completed Google analytics certificate,1

_QvQxm4dptI,Very helpful video I took this course as a beginner  and it was really helpful,1

_QvQxm4dptI,New Meta courses here,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Alex Meta is launching five new courses this month one of them is Database Engineer But to review them need to wait till 2023 as the courses are released bit by bit,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Alex i did all and passed first five courses The last one I did not do as the course was NOT launched yet and not worth paying USD49 for continue

Yeah the data grading really a low blow",0
_QvQxm4dptI,This is my first comment on here I hope you see it What do you think of creating a Discord server for your Data Analyst community maybe potentially help some of your community members build a type of connection in the data world I know it wont be easy with your schedule and all but please think about it,1
_QvQxm4dptI,How much time would it take to complete the course with 45 hrs everyday Ive already completed google data analytics course,0
_QvQxm4dptI,This was super informative I graduated college about a year ago with double majors in business analytics and marketing and have been thinking about getting into more marketing analytics type work after working with more general data and some heavyadvanced financialaccounting data  not my cup of tea at my current job I have the data background and general marketing knowledge but not much experience in specific marketing analytics techniques  that part of this course may be interesting,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hey Im that character from the 2nd course  Only watch 720 to 935 especially 50 the part where its about me  my part 

But more seriously a buddy of mine follows you and I just so happened to check you out via them where I saw this review of the Meta course I helped build I wont comment too much about the course  your review but I will say I think its fair coming from a data analyst and theres always room for improvement for the team

I actually work fulltime as a data scientist  machine learning engineer but I teach  help develop technical courses on the side But I usually go the offcamera route or do live recordings I used to be a data science instructor  curriculum developer at a boot camp Flatiron School where I would do live lectures Frankly its nice to hear your relatively positive comments on the part I helped build and lead

I personally try to constantly improve maybe my stage presence could be better  but I wont lie and say that it didnt make me feel proud that you generally liked my section  I could easily see creating a whole course from just a couple weeks of the Python section but of course there are real world restrictions  limitations that come into play in building a full course like this And I am obviously biased towards my section since its what most closely what I do in my daytoday lol

Anyways thanks for sharing your opinions in this review I know everyone on the team  I are always looking to improve Ive been wanting to go back and make more explanation YouTube videos on data science machine learning and software development so this has personally been helpful

I couldnt ask for a more honest and independent review from a data analyst Keep it up",1
_QvQxm4dptI,Hi thank you for your amazing content I am following your tutorials So far the journey is amazing But I want to level up difficulty level and skill level But I am unable to figure out how to do Can you please make a video or series to demonstrate how actual data analysis projects work in real world organization Thank you,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Hello Alex can you please make a video on questions which can be ask in an interview from the projects you have created when we put them into our resume,0
_QvQxm4dptI,Hi sir Alex I just been wondering is your tabluea tutorial series is done Or are we going to see an intermediate series Thank you sir Alex been a fruitful journey for me since I watched your videos,0
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thank you for reviewing this course I Have question about what courses recommended about finance for data analysis 
And thank you again 
Have a nice day",1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Boy all that negativity and you gave it a 6  Based on your underwhelmed analysis you should have given it a 3 or 4  

Thanks for your review of this course",1
_QvQxm4dptI,Sir now I am pursuing integrated mtech 5 years course specialization in data science now I completed 3rd can you please say how to and how much I need to prepare to get decent job as fresher in data science sector because there are vast number of topics I am very confused like upto how many concepts I need to cover as a fresher to get decent job in data science sector,0
_QvQxm4dptI,Nice review Are you done with the google challenges  Btw I also got the same link upon completion of the course,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hey Alex Thanks for the info as always 
Being from such a large and wellknown company I wonder if they will update the course or keep it more META specific",1
_QvQxm4dptI,Hello Alex i already finished the google data analytics course what course would you recommend for someone with interest in business abal,0
_QvQxm4dptI,Thank you for the review Alex But I wouldnt touch anything that comes out of Meta Their massive corruption and lack of ethics really disvalue the reputation of their certified exams and may even hurt your resume There is a reason why they ditched their Facebook name Besides it is better to go for more technical certs offered by actual colleges better experience and knowledge,1
_QvQxm4dptI,The doppelgnger comment,0
_QvQxm4dptI,I started taking the first two courses a few months ago after taking the Google Analytics certification because I am working in marketing I found them content to be pretty basic as well very introductory I stopped the course and started studying for the Marketing science meta certification by myself I already have knowledge in statistics Python and data modeling by watching the blueprint videos and lectures I passed at my first attempt and I can say the most important thing is to understand the basics of Facebook products for data analysis hypothesis interpretation of MMM models conversion and brand lifts,1
_QvQxm4dptI,To be honest data camp is better,1
_QvQxm4dptI,I liked you comment about the man at the basement,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Currently on my first course of the specialization It isnt something I already dont know but its a great collection of information considering I am a self learner,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thanks for the review Alex

Since I started my journey in the Data Analytics field I have the feeling that Udemy courses made by expert individuals are more practical and better suited than those from big universities or companies 

I am currently halfway the DA Google certifcate and although it is very well explained and the content goes straight to the point it feels a bit slow and full of  things that in my opinion are important but secondary such as communication CV preparation ethics
I had another bad experience with a popular Javascript course from Hapwkings University

Whereas other courses that I took about Python and ML taught by particulars are more focused on the skills 

I guess we have to balance the possibility to get a valid certification and the actual content we learn 

Thanks again love your content

Carlos",1
_QvQxm4dptI,A Facebook data center is 5 miles from where I live I think this would be nice if it helped people to get hired,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Dont normally comment but I started watching your videos back in October of 2021 After watching your videos and doing the Google Analytics Certificate I am starting my first tech job as a Jr Data Analyst So thank you for all your videos and information it definitely helped me on my career change,0
_QvQxm4dptI,I disagree with the part where you said clustering is not related to marketing analytics A lot of companies do use clustering for customers segmentation before they ads I am not sure abt the context in this particular course though,0
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks Alex this was helpful,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"I agree It looks pretty basic As someone learning Python I wouldnt go for it 
Also Alex you can always increase the playspeed of the videos Saves times
Finally I hope those Meta lectures dont come after you for your honesty",0
_QvQxm4dptI,I took his course and I share the same sentiment about the course being a bit boring and the support for the data analytics course was poor after running into a grading issue,-1
_QvQxm4dptI,hi alex   i come from djibouti and i like   data analyse  and you help me to built hard portoflio   and you give me a confidence to start my journey as data analyste,-1
_QvQxm4dptI,Hi Alex if Im only interested in the marketing data analytics part of the course I have finished the google data analytics certification have python and sql knowledge as well Do you recommend only taking section 4 and skipping the rest,0
_QvQxm4dptI,I am close to finish the Google Data Analytics professional course so whats your recommend for this course Do I need to do this or not necessary,0
_QvQxm4dptI,Hey Alex can you make a video on how to practice solving case studies  It would be great for data nerds and me too,1
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thanks for this Alex I feel like Marketing Analytics is a hugely underserved domain considering what a staggering amount of money is involved 

Also because thats where I work and it hurts my feelings that more attention is not paid 

Im working through the Google Digital Marketing course which is fascinating but not super Analyticsfocused",1
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks for keeping it real,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Hello Alex good morning I wanted to ask what subtopics in excel do I need to know to be a data analyst also Like are we supposed to all the formulas and steps by heart Please kindly advise Thanks,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks for the video Alex  would you say your video on best courses for data analysis from earlier this year is still up to date or would you add any other course there,1
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks for reviewing this I have just finished some parts of the Google analytics course so Im trying to find what to do next I think the Google course is a little bit basic if you have analytics experience already although I did learn things from the course that will help make me a more well rounded data analyst  Great content as always,1
HX2TabgkzHo,The link worked for me  and now im on level 2 The first challenge was so easy took me 26m17s but now stuck on second one  BTW thanks alex for posting this video,1

HX2TabgkzHo,I skipped it Now Im curious to see if I still have access to it,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Great Work How can I move annotations from Universal to GA4,1
HX2TabgkzHo,Hello Alex can you upload the solution of the last problem,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Hey ATA I recently finished the course and was given the same link but I havent started it yet  I was curious since this video is now several months old were you able to fully infiltrate Commander Lambdas organization and stop the LAMBCHOP Doomsday device,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Update I have just finished the course and Google have now added a couple of sentences before the puzzle  We invite you to stretch your skills in a new way This puzzle isnt part of passing the certificate or getting a job just a fun way to challenge yourself  Lol,1

HX2TabgkzHo,I finished the course and now Im doing the foobar challenge I figured out the 2nd problem on paper now I just need to figure out how to code it lol I am learning a lot as Im working through it I wonder if this will help in any way if I apply to google afterwards,1
HX2TabgkzHo,I was just studying about itertools today and suddenly my window bended saying It seems you are speaking our language and asked to try a game and when I clicked it opened the foobar challenge and I completed my first level which was a very straight forward question which took me 7 minutes to complete Excited to solve and try my best,1
HX2TabgkzHo,Is this hiring platform open to non US citizens too The coursera job platform is US only I dont want to do the challenge and no one even acknowledging it,0
HX2TabgkzHo,They teach R in that course Why is the challenge in python,0
HX2TabgkzHo,I am going to start the data analytics course through merit America in 2 weeks and Ive been looking at data analyst jobs and all of them say bachelors is required will it be difficult to find a job in the field with only a google certification,-1

HX2TabgkzHo,Im on my way to finishing this course and this video made me wanna finish it faster,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Hi there great video and really useful I am considering changing careers and becoming a Data Analyst I just had a question please  do you think in a few years time the role of a Data Analyst may be able to be completely done by a Data Scientist Therefore there being less of a need for Data Analysts as Data Scientists will have the skills to carry out the duties of the Data Analyst role Thanks in advance,1
HX2TabgkzHo,What is f wrong with you,-1
HX2TabgkzHo,I took the foobar challenge back in 2017 when I was first learning python It popped up mysteriously after doing a ridiculous number of Google searches related to python in a short period of time Stayed up for two days straight and solved the first two and almost the third before running out of time Learned a lot in the process though,0
HX2TabgkzHo,"Y were you hiding in the closet broo
Spook your viewers is good idea though",1
HX2TabgkzHo,I figured it out when I was pursuing the GDA course after solving it badass momentI searched the web about it  surprisingly there are thousands of comments stating that theyve won the challenge and still they werent hired,1
HX2TabgkzHo,I took and completed the google data analytics course but never received this email from them,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Ive taken the certificate and got to the challenge as well Im currently at level 3  only took the 1st challenge in it up to now and thought it was pretty hard I had the same persecutory syndrome as youre having haha its pretty weird how Google actually managed to keep it a secret mostly,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Haha well time for me to pass that certificate,1
HX2TabgkzHo,To summarize you dont recommend Google data analyst course,0
HX2TabgkzHo,I did the certification a while ago cannot see any binary code now Does it disappear,0

HX2TabgkzHo,Very interesting If you find secret hiring platforms from other big companies please let us know lol,1
HX2TabgkzHo,The best promotion for Coursera ever,1
HX2TabgkzHo,I got that foobar challenge too a few weeks ago after searching up lambda expression Thats the most common way to prompt the invite apparently Its just a random challenge thats been deprecated lol no biggie,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Best intro of the year,1
HX2TabgkzHo,ALEX This is very true I did it but didnt finish because i didnt have time I completed the first challenge and passed But I didnt complete the other two because I didnt care about it really I just thought it was a game Im a data engineer and I didnt think much about it This is very very true,1
HX2TabgkzHo,Ive been completed this certificate a while back It was fun but entry level though,1
HX2TabgkzHo,Wow Typing the link didnt worked but Ive accesed Coursera and found the binarie code translated and now Im in Amazing,1

HX2TabgkzHo,My Chromebook crashes all the time Usually its NBD bc it turns on in 2 seconds and all tabs restore in 2 more,1
HX2TabgkzHo,"I was thinking for that challenge there are four steps 
1 Use a for loop and take the ABS of each number 
2 Sort all numbers from least to greatest
3 Slice the list 02 
4 Multiply the remaining numbers 

All these features are found in numpy unless if thats not allowed 

Seems like a lot fun doing these challenges but if I saw that site I be like pass because I would be afraid of someone getting into my computer",0
HX2TabgkzHo,"in the first challenge do we need to create an attribute of solution function 

because in given tests it is solutionsolution 

i am getting ryt ans for 1 and 3 but wrong for rest",-1
HX2TabgkzHo,I was using google as my search engine and Ive been learning lots of coding for the past few months I stumbled upon that link the google browser basically asked the same question and then that foobar link appeared I wasnt able to do anything with it though since Im a beginner But it does imply that google knows everything about the activities we do here on the internet,0
HX2TabgkzHo,I got that email after I finished the course a couple weeks ago And found that url I tried solving the first one but my python skills are very limited Might go back and try again though after seeing this,0
HX2TabgkzHo,I remember seeing this when I completed the cert in May I logged back inafter watching your videoand now theres a statement above the binary code essentially saying this puzzle isnt part of passing the cert or getting a job,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Just curious why are they giving coding questionsI guess people pursuing this course would barely be able to write a function Why would a person who knows how to code even go for this course,1
HX2TabgkzHo,I love this new stuff youre trying out,1
HX2TabgkzHo,It doesnt make sense I completed google data analytics course 1 year ago but I didnt get anything like that plus they dont teach you Python or Java why would they challenge you on those languages,0
HX2TabgkzHo,My computer crashed the exact same day But not right after tho it was two hours before I even heard about this  Im freaking out in the closet but then Ill go do video editing before I post it of course Heres to blowing up your channel Im assuming thats what youre expecting to happen,0
HX2TabgkzHo,I am laughing  and learning,0
HX2TabgkzHo,Oddly enough after watching this I remember having a binary code during one of my first courses I didnt think anything of it since I was just beginning to learn data analysis,1

HX2TabgkzHo,Alex this is hilariously entertaining and educational at the same time Well done sir,1

gP-AxNi6uxo,For anyone who is confused why the end result is better and how to know that your end goal should always be to have one column per variable product supermarket date price and one row per observation This is a good practice in Power BI Python R etc Why Because normally any data can be stored like this its universal and simple,1

I am sorry Alex but I have to say something you kept on referring to MySql Postgresql and Microsoft SQL Server Management Tools as SQL or types of SQL 
MySql Postgresql and Microsoft SQL Server are database management systems NOT SQL These 3 database management systems store data using the relational model thus they are also referred to as relational database management systems
SQL is a queryprogramming language It is the standard language for relational database management systems Thus your SQL knowledge can be usedapplied to any of these 3 relational database management systems

Postgress for National and International focus  Best for this type of relational large scale database

MS SQL for a National and International focus plus the MS discount for mixing it with Azure and Office 365  Best for those all into using Microsoft only",1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thanks for your honest review Alex,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thank you so much Alex I have a question I uploaded a data containing more than 1000 rows I want to see all rows but it always return 135 rows How can it happen,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I dont think the words SQL and Database mean what you think they mean,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Another great video Your channel is truly amazing for someone trying to get into the world of data analysis like myself Also extra points for the office reference in the data,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Ive used SQL Server at extremely large scale taking in 1TB of data per day and MySQL at very large scale You get what you pay for The performance tools configurability SQL features stability etc are vastly better with SQL Server Its not even close Ive only used Postgres in small instances but I would choose it over MySQL,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Could you please zoom in while typing,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Hey Alex can you make a video on importing and exporting data in each of these SQL,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"this review is not ideal since its only scratching the surface
There is many differences that give MS SQL edge specially when it comes to performance and scalability
MySQL is ideal for small usage MS SQL for enterprise Postgres is for between
Also even Microsoft SQL sometime is not ideal for some situations and Oracle database is the only way out which is extremely expensive compare to these database in face MS SQL price is literally nothing compare to MS SQL",0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Tns alex your clips always get me out of the delimma,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Will focus on Posgres vs SQL Server in a quick postPostrgres peformance is awful for complex sql with many joins plus security is bad in most scenarios when you compare with SQL Server This is from my experience with large tables Things that take minutes and hours in postgres will take seconds in SQL Server Thats a fact Also the default Postgres sql tool is not up to standard  when you compare it to SSMS Also if you are trying to locate  a performance issue i have so many optons and tools in SQL Server  but its all very basic in postgres,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Did you just base your decision for which rdbms to get based on the frontend they ship Pretty bad way of choosing a database system,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Excellent comparison video  thank you  I used MongoDB NoSQL for a project because I wanted to be able to store ragged data formats for program preferences that wouldnt form neatly into a rowcolumn table  I have since migrated to PostgreSQL since it has support for JSON and JSONB types which are even indexable Another big reason I went to Mongo was its ability to index spatial data maps  Given Postgress tight integration with mapping using PostGIS it makes it a nobrainer for any map based database usage  BTW I cant stand PG Admin either when it was a compiled WindowsMac program or now as a web based solution  Its slow and painful to use  I found a great multiuse SQL client DBeaver which in the freecommunity version supports many SQL versions and is lightning fast  Note I have no relationship whatsoever to DBeaver  just found it starting using it and became a huge fan,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I dont think its very fair  to compare DB server by their default client UI There are a lot of better clients like Postico for postgresql  I wont lie I think Postgres is the best as it support JSON Geometry data with Postgis easy replication and fail over built in good CLI tools to backup restore and a lot of others extensions its the Swiss knife of SQL As for double quotes in syntax its only required for special keyword and if not snake case lowercase,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"viewer Why we use MySQL 
ContentCreator  Because I love it 
Really Bro",1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,dang it mysql workbench doesnt run on ARM mac mini m1,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I used SQL Server extensively from about 1997 to 2003  One thing I recall is they had was ability to view the entity relationship diagram which is important for design  Does MySQL server client have this as well  I really want to get into SQL Development again on my mac,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thank you Alex You have helped me all the way through college and now with my first interview in the real world I appreciate all the help,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Shallow  somewhat misleading comparison,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,in my opinion as PostgreSQL user Microsoft SqlServer in another level With tSql which enable you to create awesome functions run on server  Which Done by programming languages in another database engines   MySQL is so popular because of powerful but because of easy reach and host  but in SqlServer send some variable by the name of stored procedures and let hem do the validation entries calculation and return you confirm or he rollback all changes as bulk of entries done by one procedures,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Great video Any chance a comparison adding Oracle SQL Developer in the future,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Hi great content QuestionIve been learnig from SQLite and now I want to learn MySQL but just upload a dataset is hell it so SLOW does are another way to practice in MYSQL or may be to upload data in a way that it does not too sloooooow your chanel is awesome,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Converted an app from SqlServer to Postgres  One huge issue is that Postgres does not allow temporary variables youd have to use a function while TSQL does  Theres a way to do that sort of functionality in Postgres outside of a function but its not intuitive and its barely written up on the internet so it took a while to get an optimal solution  That said I do like Postgres a bit more  seems a bit more pure

Postgres also seems to have a lot of datatypes  This might be relevant for some though its probably not an issue for the vast majority of apps

And yes Postgres is free and SqlServer licensing is very complex and can get expensive in the lower tier you need server licenses as well as client licenses and the client licenses are per device",1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,SQL Server is the easiest to useMy opinion,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Alex Sybase invented TSQL Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server uses TSQL,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Awesome I was really looking for clear clarification like yours,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Muito bom,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,but only postgresql is 100 for free even for commercial use  right and it provides geo spatial functions and it has much easier syntax for uuid and json object selector than mysql,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,After over 30 years of database development I can tell you there is no comparison between the three tools mentioned In any situation where scalability is of value Sql Server is the only true candidate for developers there is a free unlimited version of Sql Server DEV ED that works very well For homepersonal web site use Sql Server Express coupled with SSMS is unbeatable if used correctly,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Quoted column names are also required in Oracle if the column names are mixed case  To avoid having to quote all required names in queries I always capitalise on import of data,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,My pet peeve is when people pronounce SQL as Sequel,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Favorite type of SQL   Or favorite relational database  You are using the term SQL when you mean relational database,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,This is like comparing food by the plates you use to serve it,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Let me give you the real answer If you want your database hacked then use that POS microsoft sql server If you like licking Ellisons behind use mysql  if you want a free database that kicks ass Use Postgres  DBeaver cant tell you how much I loathe MSSQL,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,You dont talk about different types of SQL you talk about different type of management tools,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,SQL Server has advantage in diagram view you can easily design the database at SSMS,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,You completely missed the actual essential differences Scalability Stability Performance There is a huge difference from PostgreSQLMSSQL to MySQL,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Ugh the pronunciation of Postgres is so bad that I cant watch this and question its validity  Sorry I was really interested in this comparison  Also Its My Ess Cue El not MySequel,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"This is not of a comparison of the DB but the defacto UI tools  Theres no comparison of any real technical details

MySQL is IMHO the absolute worst when it comes to data consistency and expectation of results  It is not very ANSI SQL compliant and even utf8 isnt Every single time I use it it pisses me off Not to mention Maria is really what youd want to use doing MySQL is barely maintained

SQL Server is decent as a developer Nice still as an administrator The Enterprise features are super easy compared to MySQL and PostgreSQL

As a developer I think PostgreSQL is leaps and bounds the best of the three From geospatial data support to JSON functionality Custom types etc Its just better in so many ways Also there is commercial support from EnterpriseDB That said high availability configuration is the most difficult of the three But its well supported in every major cloud provider so you dont have as much to worry about in practice  Not to mention wire compatible alternatives like cockroach etc",1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Wow this video is suprisingly bad You claim that you compare the databases and what you actually spend time on is looking at the management UI Thats the least important part of any database

And it just hurts my ears that you keep saying sequel which is just wrong",-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Useful video but the audio sounds like it was recorded off Single Side Band  Excessive compression,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,MySQL does implicit commit on DDL commands when run in transaction Which ruins the purpose of using a transaction,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Id be interested to know a feature Postgres lacks which SQL Server has Postgres is what I suggest people replace Oracle with MySQL is what I suggest people who want to use just SQL use and I dont recommend anyone use SQLServer,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Doesnt matter how good MS tech is market is moving into open source Tooling support wasnt mentioned here,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,The Linux drivers for Microsoft SQL are absolute garbage and Indian contractors are the only people on the planet who want to use it,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I am running sql server on my mac,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Postgres delivers a level of features and performance that far outranks both MySQL and MSSQL It comes out of the box with a bunch of features and optimizations such as native json support gis support and pgpsql I agree MySQL is a good beginner friendly DB but for serious work I only typically use two databases PostgreSQL stand alone deployment and SQLite embedded,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Totally agree with your assessment  First database server I used was SQL Server  Used it for over a decade and build many very large databases  Latest job has a large cloud based Postgresql DB  There are SO many times I think man this would be so much easer in TSQL and would end up with a faster more efficient query instead of this weirdly complicated CTE  I also miss SSMS so much  Ive been searching for something that has a similar feel and efficiency  Nothing   Anyone,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thanks  for taking the liberty to explain the differences and similarities on different SQLs Really informative However we dont choose what to use Its the employers choice,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Having so little and even false knowledge about databases you should definitely not make videos about this subject,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Well you should compare the SQL language dialect differences because some of the DB servers have the builtin programming language extensions and they are really quite different But the SQL language is quite standardized by ISO  IEEE standard or something and the difference between the SQL dialects is mostly the servers builtin functions like string or data values processing and some special language extensions which are using the specific features of each DBserver For example the MS SQL server is using the TSQL TransactSQL programming language extension but the PostgreSQL is using  the PLpgSQL Procedural LanguagePostGres Structured Query Language and the Oracle DBservers are using the PLSQL Programming LanguageSQL extension The PLextensions are used for the serverbased business logic programming mostly for writing stored procedures user functions triggers packages etc So in my opinion you should compare the SQL language dialect differences not the PLextensions and not the IDEs which is not a property of the SQL language itself,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"You are comparing database system that are different 
The syntax is part of the tool but never should be the first choice when it comes to decide which database system we are about to choose
For example mysql is normally not durable unless they changed it it means that you might loose some information in case of crash So if you own a company that needs to be sure that no data is lost in case of crash and you choose mysql because its easier to codeunderstand you might get a lot of trouble when you server will crash and part of your data is gone
When it comes to maintenance there is always a trade off between a system that has great support and a system that has less paid vs free 
Same comes with community The bigger the community the less pain you will have when looking for someone having a solution to your problems These are important criteria too
For the rest every database system has most in common in the language",1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,PostgreSQL is usually pronounced post gress  and if you included the QL you say  Q L at the end but since Postgres can also be a NoSQL DB key pairs JSON document storage etc most people who use it regularly call it just Postgres,0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Sorry but those are the user interfaces that comes by default with the DBMs Not a comparison by itself which should start by how well they implement the relational algebra and then how they implement the the desired properties about transactions concurrency indexing consistency security permissions granularity logging recovery escalation mantainance troubleshooting support isolation levels and scopes hinting and how much youd rely on them and so forth,-1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thanks for sharing this In my personal experience PostgreSQL is the most fully featured and powerful Database out of the 3 you compared PostgreSQL is the fastestgrowing of all relational databases a lot of innovation coming from PG community There is also a plethora of extensions for many use cases and PG is being adopted as the core of many new cloudnative databases neon Yugabyte Googles AlloyDb CitusDB AWS Aurora Serverless as well EnterpriseDB and others But I cant argue that the 3 of those are SUPER POWERFUL and loved relational databases Keep sharing these great videos,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Overall I think this video is good exposure for people who are unfamiliar with database options but its lacking on accuracy in some ways For example you mention TSQL and that its only available for SQL Server and while this is true you failed to mention that MySQL and Postgres also have something similar TSQL is just the scripting language in MySQL its just regular ANSI sql but in Postgres theres PGSQL which is heavily influenced by Oracles PLSQL Also you mention not being able to show TSQL which was again not particularly accurate The easiest way to do that would have been to show that you can declare variables and use them in queries Again the same applies to Postgres 

the other thing that I found could have been a bit better is how you mentioned the sys objects in SQL server There are equivalents in both MySQL and Postgres as well

To me it seemed that you were not necessarily comparing databases but rather comparing the administrative and development tools for each database type Ive worked with all three tools and a few others and I find that MySQL workbench is the jankiest but then again its an Oracle product so its to be expected",0
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,it is more like of overview of mysql clients with does not make much sense in terms of db differences,1
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Hello i found your channel yesterday  watched some of you videos they are really great  good job on  all the information very helpful i just have one question based on your experience  this video seems to me that the way to go to learn SQL would be MYSQL i saw that you you have some good videos about Microsoft SQL tutorial so my question is where could be a place to learn specifically MySQL  i looked for courseara but could not find some options for Mysql i found a lot for IBM SQL but not Mysql so any place you can recommend me to look for Mysql learning  im very interested in Data analytics skills because that is the way im moving my professional grow  so thanks a lot  im watching today your tutorials for Tableau because Im interested as well to learn this tool so thank you for your time  dedication for these videos that help a lot,1

ddn-2r1j_OU,I may not get an answer to this but I have a question for someone who is thinking about going into this job I am currently working on a PhD in educational research Naturally studying in the research field I analyze data so I have some experience in excel Jasp and spss Not much because I am one semester in I obviously would need training in some of the other stuff you mentioned in other videos such as power bi and SQL but my first question would be could I put certificates from coursera on a job resume And my second question would be that after I finish this degree do many places give you pay raises Im more trying to evaluate my options for when I get out or before I get out sense I earn a masters in route to my PhD,1
ddn-2r1j_OU,,0

ddn-2r1j_OU,I love the motivation behind this video 6 months ago I decided I wanted to be a Data Analyst I cut out my distractions and set some goals I took the Google Certificate completed the capstone built a portfolio and 3 weeks ago I started applying to jobs Its definitely tough juggling a full time jobfamily as well but I cant wait to see where the grind gets me in the long run Currently I spend 2h every day of the week job huntingapplying and every weekend working on projects to add to my portfolio I keep telling myself all this hard work has to pay off I cant wait Now if only I could find some time to take more Coursera courses haha,0

ddn-2r1j_OU,When you talked about getting rid of distractions and your xbox it reminded me what I did a couple of months back that I also sold my ps4 for the same reasons Its really the aspect that is harder for me to get through We as humans are most of the time looking for short gratification and its easy to forget about the long term planning Great content,1

ddn-2r1j_OU,Click on below link for most asked Excel Interview questions,1

ddn-2r1j_OU,good points,1
ddn-2r1j_OU,What worked for me was burning the escape ship behind me by leaving my old employer I have no other option but to learn the skills to succeed as an analyst I saved up enough money to pay my bills for a few months before jumping ashore,0
ddn-2r1j_OU,Great video but I dont agree by getting rid of your distractions is the solution I love videogames and thats my entertainment sometimes but not addicted to it So if you have a family and your kids are the distraction you will get rid of them or friends who keep you asking you you will cut your friendship no its about time management and how can you squeeze these your goals and ambition in life You need to enjoy life also and my problem is not videogames its the damn phone but cant get rid of it as I need it,1

Ive received so many rejections to Data analyst jobs and internships lately Im wondering if thats the issue",0
ddn-2r1j_OU,Hard agree with physically removing distractions  Part of what makes distractions so easy to fall prey to is the easy access to them  If you have to put in more than minimal amount of effort like looking up a password to start the distraction unless theres serious avoidance issues at play you likely wont do that activity Completely removing options that let you avoid doing what you need to do is a game changer,0

ddn-2r1j_OU,"My ADHD went undiagnosed till last year at 27 and even now with treatment procrastination is always going to be an issue for me Something that sounds so simple like just get rid of distractions does not work for me as I can be distracted by literally anything and everything If any ADHDers are reading this you CAN progress but it is a lot harder and you do need to find things that work with your brain  neurotypical advice like get a planner does not usually work for us 

Data analysis is actually great for ADHD brains as we are creative problem solvers we think outside the box and are great at pattern recognition Despite the misleading name we also have great attention to detail I found your channel when I was looking into data as a career Im almost done with the Google DA Cert and I just landed my first job in data Ive only been taking this seriously for 5 months

Pf-9pjJK1e0,How many people who say sequel dislike hearing people say SQL How many people who say SQL dislike hearing it called sequel How many people dont care either way No one says MongoDB like Mongoldb but they say Mongo DB and people do say Postgress instead of Posgresequel or PostreSQL In the voice of Kenan Thompsan Whats up with that,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thanks for information It would be very understandable with pictures and schemas,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Nice Job Alex  Good Explanation,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thanks it is useful however what I realised is that No SQL databases store data in an unstructured way with low latency of data retrieval and a new field can be added without a major issue,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,very clear thanks,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,great video thank you,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Finally I can say database is easy to learn Thanks Alex,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Alex this video is short and to the point esp coming from someone who is just starting out,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Youre a blessing bro,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,I am a Cloud Engineer and most of the time Im dealing with the VM Instances and on the infrastructure side SQL or Database is not my thing or I would say I dont have a huge idea but because of this video I am able to understand the differences between SQL and NoSQL as well as the benefits of the two Thank you for this video bud New subscriber here,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Is that means there are chances for the sql to be no longer wanted in the few next years,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,I use SQL for things like storing integer decimal and boolean values and email addresses and password hashes I always keep the sql table size relatively small For large datas such as long text image address et cetera I use mongodb and I store the Id of the row from the SQL in the mongodb docs I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row I select the mongodb docs data This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small its much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document youre looking for from the mongodb Also one more keynote to take here is that Its always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default drop it to something like 400500 also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000 increase it to like 32000 or even more if youre not on an hedt platform This way itll take much less time to refresh the memory and youll have more cycles to access to the memory But you gotta run linpack xtreme and memtest and if you can plug a gpu in and run a time spy loop in order to validate stability,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Hey Alex Thank you so much for giving us your knowledge and sharing your experiences I feel so greatful for finding you
I am a future data analyst I took the Google Data Analytics course from coursera and I have an issue I want to practice on SQL and I cannot find a software to do data entry my laptop has windows 7 operating system could you please help me I desperately want to practice on that",-1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Nice video Alex One question Is a data lake one type of NoSQL database,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Very helpful  Thank you,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thank you for explaining the concept in such brief and concise way,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Not a word about access methods Why is retrieval latency and scalability of NoSQL DBs supposedly better then that of relational databases what makes search of unstructured or semistructured data fast  
Also not a word on possibility of horizontal scaling of relational databases via table partitioning over many cluster members",1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Just stumbled upon your channel I love it So you have a sub from me,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thanks for this Video There is NoSQL DBs with SQL query engines avaliable as well For example CrateDB Here you can use normal SQL grammar instead of learning a new like with Mongo,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,i had to decrease the speed of the video to the half but I got the points sound  and clearthanks,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Hi Alex thank you for this wonderful video I was wondering if you could do a video on how to fix the error message role does not exist in popsql,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Great Video,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Open the below link and watch YouTube video for a Data Analysis Project Based on Excel,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,This is REALLY informative would love for more similar short videos like this You explained it really well thanks Alex,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Great video Somewhy the mic sound felt a bit off in this vid is it just me It sounded a bit unnaturalrobotic sometimes,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Hi Alex can you tell me how to accept meeting invite automatically using ms graph api in outlook,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,A NoSQL database may or may not store data in a table with rows and columns Definitely a widecolumn database will be a roworiented store with columns Cassandra or ScyllaDB for example,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Bravo,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Without degree can I be called data analyst if I go for Google data analyst professional certificate,0
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Just putting this out there the reason why SQL doesnt handle biglarge transactions well is cause of the ACID properties specially the i which is isolation meaning transactions happen wihtout interrupting or affecting others thanks to that many sql databases lock the rows or columns being used so in the case of receiving large and many queries its easy tor each the point where you are trying to access data thats been locked thanks to a previous query so its kinda like a bottleneck,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Hi alex
What is the best source to practice nosql",1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,thank you for this vid i was recently wondering whats the difference between the two and then you uploaded a vid about it haha love how your explanation is short  simple to understand,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Your camera overlaps some of the fields you showed in the presentation which I found disturbing but thank you for vodeo,-1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Alex your videos helped me land a position as a Fraud Data Analyst right out of undergrad I was offered the position in October 2021 graduted in December 2021 began my role in January 2022 Thanks for being such a great resource,1
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thanks a lot once again Alex Your channel is the first place where I look for something related to Data Analytics If someone asked me for a single channel about DA I would recomend yours Dont get me wrong I do enjoy other channels but I think the way you organize ideas and concepts is the most comprehensive for me,0

-bSkREem8dM,You smile like you were born without a CNS,1
-bSkREem8dM,3 Years late but this is very helpful  My agency is turning towards a Data Lakehouse now which I suppose somehow combines the functions of both a data lake and a data warehouse,0
-bSkREem8dM,Wow Alex amazingly explained in a few minutes,1
-bSkREem8dM,"Hallo Alex 
You have missed two pieces in your analyze whichre data marts and data cubes Beside that data warehouse is an old designation to what we call today data lake Also your last illustration is more about system like Hadoop In resume these three designations can swap one to another and this is not a question of technologies but its about practices configurations and qualities",1
-bSkREem8dM,The definition of database could be a couple of things which is confusing Many companies have a Data Warehouse which is a type of database which sources its data from a Data Lake andor an ERPCRM transactional database or some middleware A reporting database or semantic model is a relational database used in reporting tools such as Power BI or Cognos and typically represents a silo of information such as HR Sales or Inventory and contains more nuanced data  calculations and KPIs specific to that Silo Many times it is sourced from the Data Warehouse itself although if a company does not have the OLAP layer it can also come from a Data Lake andor an ERPCRM transactional database,1

-bSkREem8dM,Best explanation Crisp short and to the point Thanks Alex,1
-bSkREem8dM,"tldr Alex is the Flexible Schema property for Database correct It seems contrarian to what a Relational Database is like as its supposed to be SchemaOnWrite


Ive taught myself about relational databases through  and I also saw this one 

When I was writing my notes from them I remembered about the note that I wrote from watching your video here specifically in 042 onwards and when I crossreferenced it I found that your explanation here seems to be a bit confusing perhaps specifically the How the data is organized What do you mean by that Because Flexible Schema sounds to me like a SchemaOnRead paradigm and yet a Relational Database is rigid and the user must know the schema first before you write it so it should be SchemaOnWrite Or am I confused here",-1
-bSkREem8dM,Nice video,1
-bSkREem8dM,Wrong Dude misleading video in some parts,-1
-bSkREem8dM,I have been wondering what the difference is between these three You explained it very well Glad I saw this video one day before my exam,1
-bSkREem8dM,Thank very much  this is a very clear explanation,1
-bSkREem8dM,There is also another less known term known as DATA contraction Its the process of getting rid of or expunge duplications or useless data from table and reducing the table size,-1
-bSkREem8dM,Thanks for the amazing video Is there any difference between data warehouse and OLAP,1

-bSkREem8dM,Well no I use a data lake in my work everyday You don need put it in a datawarehouse or database You just need to use multi hop architecture and use the gold layer for analysis Data lake is a no brain choice if you are working with big data You can go one more step and jump into a delta lake with ACID transactions,0

xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion 1 crew First heard of data analytics in Jan 22 Started watching your vids and have an interview for a data analyst role next week,1
xKdtP3IZbnU,I am conflicted about all this time management and doing extra work On one hand as you say really playing games is empty and leads nowhere but on  the other hand where does the grind lead You will be making more money but if you work all the time what are you gonna spend that money on I dont see other reason to grind couse if you enjoy something you dont  need time management to find time for it And if we grind for money shouldnt we just try to manage our expectations  There is no freedom in wanting more everytime you reach the next goal,1

xKdtP3IZbnU,"I felt compelled to pause the video to agree wholeheartedly with what you were talking about around the 900 mark Alex Making positive changes isnt about cutting things out you have to actually replace that time with valuable efforts If you dont intentionally fill that newfound gap in your schedule you will inevitably fall back to old habits You cant just quit old habits you have to create new ones to take their place Its very similar with retirement too where you need something to run to not just work to run from but I digress I dont know if you have followed any of Cal Newports work but he talks about this a lot

GsAXOr715AU,Hi Alex today I got my job offer for the data analyst role I am thrilled Thank you for all the help I followed your channel religiously and your interview tips really helped me to ace the interview The best advice you gave was to start doing projects instead of taking class after class because I was one of those people who was focused more on taking class than to practice my skills After watching that video of yours I started working on my projects instead I am really grateful to you Thank you for being part of my journey and for guiding so many people like me I look forward to learning more from your channel,1

GsAXOr715AU,Yes,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Its good to see the other side of a glamourised profession,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Lol the reason why i like this job is i dont need to work with people that much compared to other jobs,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,We Introverts  Everything is so relatable monotony frustration saturation Aah sometimes it really bothers me so much that i want to quit  is there anything i can do to help myself,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Honestly I wished I watched this video before being a Data Analyst Sometimes I wish I choose a different career,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Ha halove the honesty there,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Your last story is very relatable A lot of stuff doesnt get used or gets looked at but the person doesnt know how to use it And overtime they start to undervalue stuff Like dont act like its so great that you automated  a report but a year later nobody remembers that you saved 10 hours a week They just get used to itIve designed dashboard or coded a  complicated reports to show that we should cancel certain products or sell in  new areas or fire certain people and then had upper management look at it and sort of shrugs their shoulders and do nothing  You hear all these grant statements about KPIs and valuing the business but when you start doing it they freeze up and go back to running on emotion,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Its like your husband tells he is super hungry you rush to cook him doing your best and then he changes his mind at the very last moment and just orders his favorite pizza or simply goes to sleep without eating,1

2JnlQ8jwWbE,What about to be a Data Scientist is that also for extroverts or more for introverts Im also an introvert,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,So it has more to do with people i e dealing with them rather than the actual data analyst work,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Can someone give suggestions which job wfhremotely with less human interaction or job no human interaction Im introvert its hard for me,-1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Hello Alex 

Do you have a video on the stress or worklife balance associated with being a Data Analyst I am currently a teacher who is taking the Google Data Analytics Certificate Or can anyone discuss this if they are a data analyst I understand every jobcareer has its difficulties

Thank you in advance",0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I appreciate what you are saying however for me as long as I am paid for the work that I do the boss can do whatever he or she wants with it,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Genuinely,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I think your point over this field maybe a clear picture of every field that nothing is glamorous or satisfying theres intense grinding frustration mental pains etc Nothing is easy comeand thats a great lesson learning for me even Im not an analyst now just started preparing for it and thanks,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Exactly lots of meetings exhaust us  If you get the manager who dont know abou data and database then he will exhaust you more and you will do revisions again and again,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Thanks for sharing
Adding a summary and chapters in the video can be very beneficial for future videos",1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,take a drink every time he says genuinely  youll be trashed before the end of the video Seriously though good content  interesting perspective especially about the data cleaning Thanks for sharing,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Im glad you chose social interaction as number 1 I battle with it a lot,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Think is one of your best topic People who dont know the job think its one of the best job because but actually as all job in the world there is bad stuffs as well,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,lol,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I understand,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I feel the second last one the most I feel like often I have to chase people down for details on some custom application or pipeline theyve requested and half the time theyre slow to answer or never do 

The expectation is that down the road theyll just hand a me a list of all the stuff I already requested after the damn thing is built and now its a huge pain to change 

This is particularly vexing because you can see it coming Youre working on some project you know doesnt have all the pieces sorted and some point in the arbitrary future theyll ask for a laundry list of tweaks you tried to collect at the outset 

And yeah Then maybe two people use it for anything",0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I felt this True words were spoken,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,the saccharine sweet corporate speak being forced to use CRAP platforms like linkedin,-1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I thought that I could relate to cleaning data until you said for 2 weeks  Ive had several reports and projects that Ive worked very hard on that have gone unused  Nothing like being on a meeting with people asking for metrics that are clearly on a report that Ive been providing for weeks  I recently realized that Ive been trying to do data analyst tasks using only Excel and a little VBA when there are other tools that are far more efficient like Power Query  So Im implementing Power Query in my current role and learning Power BI and SQL eventually Python on the side to become a real data analyst  Your videos have been extremely helpful in making the decision to pursue this and Im glad that you put this video out about some of the frustrations of the job,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Im a credit analyst in a financial institution and I relate to all of this 

The things we hate about a job seems universal but here I am still trying to shift to data analysis

The worse thing about my current job is being labelled Above Peers during my performance review but having someone labelled  be promoted instead of meI meanthats basically why Im trying to shift careers I hated it so much Im jumping ship",-1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I work as a manager in a small firm and I didnt get this problems cause I am the one asking for dara analysing it and using it later,-1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Hi Alex items 34 are unfortunately the reality for any kind of technical service for nontech people  and yes it is extremely frustrating I address it by saying to myself if you want N revisions because you could not spend 1 Hr agreeing on what you wanted I will bill you for each hour required to make the revisions Before i let the revisions get to me because i saw that they could be avoided so easily and saw my time as wasted but now i say if your laziness means I have to spend NX hours fixing it so be so,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Lets just start with what we have and we can change it later literally I felt a physical reaction in my body of NO because I know exactly what you mean Like please for the love of all things holy have a solid plan and hammer out the issues before you go forward The changes will grow exponentially and then foundation will be based on irrelevant content I am a planner I need to know all the details and I need to determine and find solutions for all the major and prominent minor problems before I do anything Travel grocery shopping home improvement furniture rearrangement etc How do people just live flying by the seat of their pants,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Everything you described is what I hated about being a system analyst at Procter and Gamble  Made me quit the whole industry for like 13 yrs  Now Im crawling back but I refuse to be over extended  Im going to lay out boundaries and clear expectations 

P S I still have access to this whole Quickbase system I set up in 2008  Untouched and all that private information still there smh lol",0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I always say to my stakeholders I dont mind the hardwork as long that you use it,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Maybe the question doesnt fit perfectly to the video but I havent found any which is better suited 

Do you have experiences with the SAP landscape in your environment After my degree I wanted to join the data world and wanted to become what I would call today a data analyst However I landed in the BI with SAP BW and feel now somehow enclosed in this universe There is hardly any connection to the topics and skills covered here data analysis Python SQL etc and I cannot even easily translate my job description Its like a perfect vendor lockin and I never hear anything about SAP in any of these popular channels like yours

Since I dont want to spend the rest of my life with clicking through SAP transactions and searching for SAP notes I want to change my career I assume that just switching to SAP Analytics Cloud would still have the same lockin effect You dont exactly work with your skills you always just have to know more about how SAP does something imho

It would be interesting if you have some experiences with this special world",1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Love the honesty in this video and working in Logistics I feel your PAIN    Its like the Wild West out there  the Good Bad and Ugly,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"No 1 and No 2  Let me know when you have a solution to these
No 3  Its better to learn to say NO and explain your reasoning behind it I have been through those situations so many times and I can save so much of my time by just saying NO
No 4  This is so common I absolutely hate this And when its something really urgent its hard to understand the priority of that task because you had this exp so many times",0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,As long as Im being paid it for it I wouldnt mind putting ini the work no one is going to use They keep spamming me when its going to be done I would just make a automated reply,0

2JnlQ8jwWbE,I appreciate your post on what you have put out here of what Data Analysis pertains to Because I am a Black woman I truly must be careful of my response verbally in the workplace even moreso with the matters U brought up  This goes for other people of color as well who want to get into this industry  I have this video saved to review when necessary,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I think often times the requester doesnt really understand what they need I try to get a solid understanding of the intent,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Thank you for the video Alex Im about to start selflearning data analytics but your comments on the social requirements are giving me pause For context i left a previous job for similar reasons as i was always mentally drained due to my introversion and anxiety Could you shed more light What goes on in these meetings Is everyone required to speak or is it more of brainstorming or receiving tasks for the day Is any actual work getting done during the meetings as its hard for me to imagine it enduring for hours,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,As someone who has worked as an analyst for 5 years every single one of these points resonated to me very strongly Especially especially the last one This is incredibly important the most important thing going on in the company This could be industry defining Never have we ever had a problem like this before we must fix it We need the data we need the dataaaaaaahhhhh then it seems like 2 weeks later there is a new this is the most important thing that has ever ever happened to the company Oh that thing from 2 weeks ago oh yeah thats important really important but this this is it the most important thing ever We need the data we need the datttaaahhh  My experience has been that the only way to deal with this is learning when to give something up learning what is the required level of quality and this does not mean more important decisions  better quality data and knowing that this sits on them more than it does on you they wasted the companies money not you,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Great video I wonder how these dislikes differ depending on whether you are an analyst in a centralized analytics dept or whether youre a solo analyst in a decentralized organizational model Im a decentralized analyst who used to be on a centralized team and my feelings about data cleaning are completely different now,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,So is it a bad career path for someone who despises meetings Ive been working in a job for about a year where I had one 30 min scrum call a day and even that had ended up being unmanageable for me And the scope creep was enough to give me nightmare and Ive quit the job without another offer in hand Can you recommend a job profile which does not have the requirement to sit in meetings for too long,-1

2JnlQ8jwWbE,Great video as always Alex Like others I found the introverted cup emptying point interesting As someone new to the analyst work and in particular a new organisation I have found the introverted  nature of myself and team members a challenge in terms of learning God help me if I do end up in half day meetings,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Alex HATES ANALYTICS and doesnt like being a DATA ANALYST EXPOSED jk

Very MUCH resonate with your first issue as a fellow introvert  I just want to play with data all day and not have to fake laugh at bad jokes",0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Thank you for this video Im glad Im not the only one who has these experiences It has sometimes been enough for me to question whether Im in the right field 

Id like to add on to your last item I did a big project for someone who wanted it urgently I worked on it for a long time while juggling my other duties receiving many requests for status updates Like your project it was never used The next month the person asked me to update the project with the current info So I went back in and spent a long time redoing the project again with many requests for status updates Again it wasnt used but the following month she wanted it updated with that months current info Wash rinse repeat 

How do you handle situations like that

Id love to see a video where you cover resources to learn soft skills like communication skills business acumen and any other skills you think data analysts may need but arent always instinctual",0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Its so good knowing that Im not the only one,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,On your last frustration sometimes in management we have to task out minor projects of lower value to team members to keep them busy when were slow It keeps them working and learning while we finalize an upcoming deal I can understand the frustration,0

2JnlQ8jwWbE,A video covering ways to overcome these would be great  Cheers Alex,1

2JnlQ8jwWbE,Hello Alex Thank you very much for sharing all of these information and knowladge about data anslysis Hoping you will notice my comment I have to ask you is Data Analyst a profession of the future I would like to learn more about Excel SQL and PowerBi in next few months and I was wondering will market need those skills in 2023 etc Is it worthy to invest my energy and time in learning mentioned skills,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I super love the social aspect of my data science job Im a consultant though and you have to be comfortable with that aspect of the work,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,6  7 hour long meetings Whyyyy  I hate meetings but still wanna explore this field lol,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,If I had to guess the data cleaning frustration comes from what I call the law of logs With any project andor information gathering the completion rate is very similar to a log graph For example 0  30 might take 3 days then 30  60 takes 6 days  and 60  90 takes 12 days At that point because of the exponential nature 90  95 could take 20 days and thats the part that starts to become frustrating The amount of time youve spent on the last stretch is starting to equal all the time youve spent on the rest and your brain cant justify the time,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Thats very true no 1  no 3 and no 4,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Omg You nailed it  Allofthem And those dashboards that I create that no one looks atI DELETE them from Tableau because I dont want them coming back a year later sayingohI found this dashboardcan you tweak it to do blahblahblah,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Thank you for being honest In our certificate program all we hear is how great it is I know its just like any other jobcareer where you get the good with the bad I already get annoyed with stuff in my classes and sometimes I just want to be like look lets not act like this is the greatest thing since toilet paper I dont have anything against positivity but I do like honesty too,1
2JnlQ8jwWbE,There is absolutely no profession I know of that doesnt have a downside Appreciate your pointing out the flaws in the data analyst position,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Alex is running out of content for the channel Saw this coming,0
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I could be wrong  to me the last couple of these seem like culture  SME onboarding issues that seep into a very new industry 

3  No Scope  Loose Scope with frequent backend revisions
4 Priority  Urgent Projects that arent utilizedviewed

Subject Matter Experts SMEs can often be notoriously unaware of how unmanageable they can be and the effect this has upon the team of professionals who work around them  

A couple ideas based on your sharing here  which I really appreciate
Might part of a solution be to simply be data driven on the back side of a project  

1 If this is urgent could we insert language to that effect into the scope document or create such a document and then continue tracking afterward to see ifhow it was utilized  

 For at least our internal use Did the urgency on the front end match the degree of utilization on the back end
 If there isnt much scope on the front end how could we document this and have the stakeholder signoff on it

2 If this seems too confrontational or unorthodox could we present this resourceenhancing idea beforehand to our lead or executive who we are most accountable to

I have seen in my experience as an instructional designer working with SMEs that guardrails and boundaries are really helpful  exactly the same way as a highly paid consultant would deftly manage the expectations and avoid getting into a place where they are stretched too thin

Your video did not come off that way at all  however reading between the lines  this was invaluable for me and other newer folks to see that SME management is always a vital part of the job  much appreciated",0

2JnlQ8jwWbE,Regarding your 4th point after a two decades of analytics experience marketing science at an advertising agency I start with the mindset that my work may not be used For me when its not used its most likely it doesnt support the stakeholders proposed plans They are quite likely to have commissioned a few pieces of analytics from different angles to back up a viewpoint or story thus want it there to be able to pick and choose I dont take it personally However knowing this Im always comfortable pushing back on timings I tend to find when someone wants something today they actually need in a week or even longer,1

hNTNZ00cZig,"Hello Alex First time i watched this video someone recommended me 
i have couple of questions please
My first question is I applied many places but didnt get chance to call for interview i dont know the reason

And any website you recommend me for perfect practice SQL Beginner to Master  
What kind of question they asked during interview for data analysis
Thanks",1
hNTNZ00cZig,Thank you for this video StrataScratch was a HUGE help in 1 keeping my SQL skills sharp while Im working through job applications and 2 helping me prepare for the technical interview questions Im able to do both of these things using the Free version of StrataScratch,1
hNTNZ00cZig,Important question please do you recommend using this site only knowing the basics of SQL and then just learning more SQL through trial and error here,1
hNTNZ00cZig,"Longer comment because this is so relevant to me right now both as an instructional designer whos added data analysis to the mix 
After having my first couple of technical interviews this is invaluable   Candidly this is a completely different world from an artificial environment such as a DataCamp or other fillintheblank approach  Filling in blanks does not teach our brains to demonstrate the realworld competency that our future team is depending on from us 

In learning engineering lingo we call this disconnect the difference between the learning context vs the realworld performance context  The goal of solid training is to first teach the basics but ensure that learners demonstrate mastery whether basic or advanced in a real world context  In the case of those of us who want jobs in this field it will be necessary to communicate what is going on in our brains just as you do in this video  To be super transparent with you and others reading this In my first such interview I candidly felt like a 2nd grader learning phonics and sounding out words which was an unpleasant feeling to put it mildly

Having to talk through a completely new SQL problem in realtime is very much a performance and having a way to simulate this in realtime would be helpful   
You demonstrated this competency in this video and that helps to a significant degree Some sort of service or fishbowl style masterclass could also accomplish this  

The community answers feature in StrataScratch is new and very helpful as there is more than one solution to these issues  Live Fishbowl style webinars one person answers while others observe or even asynchronous video submissions which could be reviewed within 72 hours or whenever could provide invaluable feedback in addition to forcing us to go through the real life situation that most job seekers will face",1
hNTNZ00cZig,You know nothing about SQL you cant think of structuring queries and your queries are not correct at all And you do this youtube channel for only money and give people false information,-1
hNTNZ00cZig,Is it possible to get data analytics remote internship,0

hNTNZ00cZig,Awesome stuff Alex  would you say being comfortable with mediumdifficulty StrataSratch SQL questions is the bare minimum requirement for the SQL portion to be qualified to apply for data analyst jobs,1
hNTNZ00cZig,I have a tech inteview with a SQL assessment tomorrow perfect timing Been using leetcode but Ill check this out too Thanks for this Alex,1

gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy my dude,0
gz2j5NBESSs,BOK CHOY You dont know how you are being a blessing and helpful in our careers Thank you Alex for this resource,0
gz2j5NBESSs,"Working from home sounds appealing for multiple reasons but for me Ill be even more socially isolated if I work from home which I think will take a toll on me  Not having others in close proximity that I can get help from or worth together on a problem with would be another problem for me  There are a lot of ways to communicate with coworkers thanks to modern technologies but its not quite a replacement to having someone physically nearby  Im also not sure I can focus as well if Im at home  Id actually have to try it to be able to know but those are my immediate concerns

Not having to commute sounds heavenly though",1
gz2j5NBESSs,Yes Driving in Dallas is a pain Main reason i want to shift to remote,0
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy 4 weeks late but here we are,-1
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you,1
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy I have been watching your videos for awhile Its been one of the main reason I took an online courses for Data Analytics I had been working in sustainability field and realized early on in the course how SQL in addition to various functions in Excel  would have reduced the number of hrs wasted on daily and weekly projects Im still anxious about looking for a career in data analytics but both your technical and topics videos give me inspiration when I falter Thanks,0
gz2j5NBESSs,"Ive never had bok choy  might try it at some point now

Alex do you think you would feel differently about working remotely if you were just starting at your current company Do you think there is more value in going into the office everyday for more junior analysts in terms of building good habits and getting acclimated easier",1
gz2j5NBESSs,Put your plaque up there We feel a connection to your success so in a way we are proud of it too And of course we love you,1
gz2j5NBESSs,"I can vouch for Alexs advice on how to get started in the field I followed all his advice including resume setup professional certifications online portfolio of work which technical skills to focus on I dont even have an undergrad degree yet Im working on it though I just accepted an offer to work at a global corporation as a Data Analyst even though I have less than 2 years experience working in a role you could argue was related to data analytics if you squinted really hard  But partially due to Alexs advice I interviewed well and had a portfolio and resume that was impressive for a fresher so I got the job And its a highpaying job too 

The way I see it getting a job in data analytics is the beginning of my learning and hard work not the end of it Now that I am in the field properly its on me to keep growing and learning",0

gz2j5NBESSs,Hey Alex Thank you so much for all of your content This video is super helpful for me at this time I just received two offers for a position as a data analyst One of them is fully in office with the opportunity to work part time remotely later down the line The other is hybrid starting off and fully remote  capable if I choose I wanted to thank you for all of your content and hard work You have helped me tremendously For any other job seekers here keep going I finished the Google Data Analytics Course two months ago and I am currently taking Fundamentals of Excel for Data Visualization also through Coursera I am planning to continue taking courses throughout my entire career Emphasizing my desire to continue learning new skills and advancing the ones I already have played a huge part in me getting offers I didnt talk much about it in the first couple of interviews that I had But when I did finally start talking about it companies definitely took note Thanks again Alex I truly appreciate you,0

I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Commercial Music I was working at a small business music retailer and in October I began the Google Data Analytics certificate after checking out your review for it I finished at the beginning of February just in time for the store I worked at to close its doors After following your videos on portfolio projects resumebuilding and 2 months of job hunting I am ecstatic to say that I accepted my first offer for an analyst job today I dont think I would have had the confidence to go for this career change without having come across your channel You really are doing the lords work Thank you so much Alex",0

Anyway keep up the good work your videos are incredible and inspiring

_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hi Alex Im trying to come up with unique ideas for my project portfolio but I am going through your entire course  Im doing this to highlight my background and explain how I have used data analysis in previous positions as a teacher library manager professor of empirical research methods and even a Realtor  But the question I ran into was this I have a data set that has given me the names of people but because of privacy laws I cant use the names in the data The names are given in one cell as last first eg  Smith John I created two columns to fix the issue by using initials I used this in the first formula

LEFTD21LEND2RIGHTD2LEND2FINDD2

I was left with a result of S11 John

In the second column I used

LEFTC21MIDC251

to get SJ

I then had to copy that column and paste it into a 3rd column to get the results independent of the formulas  Did I just reinvent the wheel or was there an easier way to do this

Also I was lucky not to have repeat initials but if I did how could I handle that",0

4A8LV6fObYA,I bought the Creator Elearning license which is cheaper than purchasing the Certification Prep Program 10 a month vs 1000,0
4A8LV6fObYA,ComptiA Data analysis,0
4A8LV6fObYA,Is free content on tableau websites enough to prepare for the exam,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Hey Alex i am in the process of deciding which one between these two to take Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate cost 39 a month or the The Tableau Data Analytics Certificate course cost around 3000 it incorporates business analytics implications I have a bachelor of science in economics and looking to do a career shift to business and data analytics I know the first certificate includes the use of R programming language so i am quite curious as to which one you recommend minding the cost skills that will be acquired and career and employment prospective Thank you so much in advance,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Theyre trying to LOOT us Maybe its a news for people in the US but education and specially exams should not cost that much,1
4A8LV6fObYA,I shelled out 750 at a discount for the exam prep course The course offers a mockup exam which is extremely valuable Using Associate Cert preparation is NOT enough For example an exam question requires us to know the difference between Rank Dense vs Unique Initial SQL vs Custom SQL  the title sounds cool but the exam is challenging if you havent used Tableau DesktopPrepServer for a while I would say years Long term I think the same is going to be a requirement Short term probably not  I took the exam on March 4 2022 and was still one of the first 1000 got this early bird thing which tells me the demand is still low or many fail,0
4A8LV6fObYA,Hi Alex I wanted to ask that I dont have computer science background Can I go for Data analyst,0
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex i will pass the data analyst exam in 4 april and I want to know if you have sources or courses to prepare for this certification 
 Thanks Alex",1
4A8LV6fObYA,Keep up the good work Alex,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Thanks for all your great advice and information,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Phewww Thanks for the video  So many requirements and certifications out there that Im asking when does it stop which in turn makes me feel like a mediocre Thought I had mastered Excel to an extent until I had to do an assessment using Google Sheets and Google Data Studio,0
4A8LV6fObYA,Thanks for the video  Any comments on the CompTIA Data cert vendor neutral that is just coming up Could you take a look at it,1
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hey Alex how are you I recently found your YouTube channel after taking an interest in data analytics Ive seen tons of your videos already and I am grateful for what you do and all the amazing content you put out Ive began taking the Google data analytics course and have been taking plenty of notes and so far I  think its an amazing course for someone whos a beginner like me but thats what scares me I went to college for a technical certificate in automotive For the last 4 years Ive been working on cars and making a living in this industry Im currently 22 and I know I have plenty of time to switch careers and do something Ill love What scares me the most about jumping ship into data analytics is the fact that my resume may be pretty weak compared to someone coming out of college with a bachelors degree in statistics or data related I plan on making a portfolio and creating an amazing LinkedIn page once I develop my skills more but looking ahead it scares me at the thought of not being able to find a job in this field and being stuck in my current career Any words of advise and encouragement 

I know the google certificate alone wont get me a job and I plan on taking a few more courses and definitely watching a lot more of your videos as well but any advise would mean a lot to me thank you",1
4A8LV6fObYA,I love how honest Alex is This is why I follow him,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Could you please recommend a good excel certification,1
4A8LV6fObYA,I took the Tableau Data Analyst Certification exam a few weeks ago and I received the result 6 hours after the exam Playing around with Tableau Desktop Tableau Prep and Tableau Server is really important because many multiplechoice questions ask you to list the procedure for doing certain steps ie creating subscriptionsalerts exporting cleaned data from Tableau Prep,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Which looks better on a resume this or the Google data analytics certificate,1
4A8LV6fObYA,"Jalapeno Oh wait

A grand seems like a lot especially if you have more time than money  Im sure there are people in both situations",1
4A8LV6fObYA,Which one to get Tableau data analyst vs    CompTIA Data,0
4A8LV6fObYA,My company is paying for the exam readiness program and Im looking to start it in JulyAugust Ill report back when I do I appreciate the thoroughness Alex,-1
4A8LV6fObYA,Hello Alex How do you get this Tableau software Is it after you enroll for the course,0
4A8LV6fObYA,Hello Alex now Ive only just got done with the 3rd Course of the Google Data Analytics certificate As u know only too well I shall eventually have to explore working with tableau doesnt the google certificate offer sufficient knowledge of tableau to get started as a junior data analyst  Will I have to go deeper with the coursera specialization on visualization  Lastly ur opinion on the free tableau courses on YouTube as a substitute for the coursera specialization,0
4A8LV6fObYA,Why would one want a certification from Tableau Do employers really care As long as you practice and make projects and focus on getting better isnt that enough,1
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex

So as per your inputs which certification can turn out to be useful for gaining knowledge also helpful in future",1
4A8LV6fObYA,Ugh Coursera is way better with free certs Dunno why they cost a lot,1
4A8LV6fObYA,For me  250 USD is absolutely too expensive for taking a tableau Data Analyst Exam If you want to show your future employers that you know how to build tableau dashboards  i think taking Tableau Specialist to good enough to go,0
4A8LV6fObYA,Im putting this video in watch later I finished sql  right now and i want to do lts of projects i saw your video on projectstheyre very helpful,1
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex At first please receive my thanks for all those amazing advices Your videos like many have helped me too to find the confidence and work towards the data analyst goal
I have a question to ask you What is the significance of statistics to be a good data analyst Should I learn statistics skill aside the basic ones before or after the data analyst certifications",1
4A8LV6fObYA,Hey Alex You seem to be an amazing guy love your videos Can u do a similar video for power bi too,1
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex
Thanks for making such informative video as always

Im a beginner and want to learn Tableau from scratch

Thanks",1
4A8LV6fObYA,Hello Im new to the channel and have a few questions What would you recommend for someone whose is interested in getting into the field I started a course on coursera but got sidetracked Ive even considered just going back to college switching my major and doing it that way Any advice would be greatly appreciated,0
4A8LV6fObYA,great vids like always will you be making in the future more project based tuts this channel is a great resource keep going thank you Alex,1
4A8LV6fObYA,Can a guy that learned tableu while google data analytics certification program pursue this certification,0

MPENhkuSo0Q,Also wondering about years of experience When you have a portfolio but no direct work experience should you apply for jobs that ask for 2 years data analysis experience 3 years What do you think is practical Alex,0
MPENhkuSo0Q,Another title that seems to align well with data analysis is a retention analyst I currently am in a role as a retention specialist and found when learning data analyst skills there was a ton of overlap I am now in round 3 and a finalist for a client retention analyst position thanks to the combined skillsets,0
MPENhkuSo0Q,How does Research Analyst compare to Data Analyst Would that be a good first step when trying to get into Data Analytics,1

MPENhkuSo0Q,I am towards the end of the Google Data Analytics certificate and I find the visualizations most interestingI think about taking a Tableau course next on Coursera,1
MPENhkuSo0Q,Could a masters in business analytics help,0

3irO29PJQHs,Im about to really start my journey so glad I found you,1
3irO29PJQHs,This is cool and very helpful   Id like to see an update for 2024  For instance could you replace IBM Data Analytics with the Google Advanced Data Analytics and the Business Intelligence course  Ive just started my journey into analytics with the Digital marketing course and now the Google Analytics course  Followed by the advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence when I get to it,1
3irO29PJQHs,"I wish the IBM one was included in Coursera Plus but none of the IBM courses are unfortunately I had most of these bookmarked already but added the last one for Tableau I decided getting the Plus was the better option since I completed the Google Data Analytics in just over 4 weeks I figure itd be a waste of money to end up paying for a second entire month if I finish in 5 6 weeks 

There is a Tableau Business Intelligence Analyst one too that looks like it will be fun to learn",0

3irO29PJQHs,"Thanks for the video Alex   I want to learn Python really bad but Im very new to data analytics  So I most likely will go with Coursera Still deciding
Excellent video Alex   I just have to make up my mind",1
3irO29PJQHs,"Coursera sucks  Learned more about SQLPYTHON in 3 weeks at Udemy than 4 to 5 months with Cousera  

Plus  You actually own the course and review it unlimited times vs paying a monthly fee  Less than 250 you can learn all the skills you need get started as a data analyst or programmer  

You can always list those certifications from Coursera on your resume as employers will not check   Wasted my moneytime with Coursera",0
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex Thanks very much for this video Im about to begin my journey as a data analyst Do you have any idea how i can apply for financial aid on the Google certification alongside the other courses you recommended

3irO29PJQHs,I am taking the analytics course from Google So should I also take any of these along with it for better results,1

3irO29PJQHs,Thank you for the video this made me realize that I really should take the IBM DA course instead of Googles to learn some Python skills as I eventually want to go into Data Science,1
3irO29PJQHs,Very informative  What technical resources would you recommend to take these courses   Thx,0
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you Professor Alex for this wonderful video All the courses you mentioned are excellent except for a SQL course The method of presenting the course is very bad and there are great gape between the first part of the course and the second part For me this course is unusable,1
3irO29PJQHs,what the best for Machine Learning IBM Data Analyst or Google data analysis,1
3irO29PJQHs,Youre the man I really cannot say thank you enough Im beyond grateful for your energy inspiration and youre making the world a better place,1

3irO29PJQHs,What the price,0
3irO29PJQHs,Is it worth for it to do a MSc in Data science from Uk,1
3irO29PJQHs,Sir why dont you open a course by yourself and teach us all about industrial data analysis,0
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex I have been following your channel and have made some moves out of a management role in Admin where I dabbled in some reporting and started to explore a career shift I am following along with your videos to see what exactly the path I should take is but with very little experience im wondering if there are some things you would suggest I do before taking the journey through the courses in this video

Knowing the Google cert is for beginners I am just thinking there may be some intermediate or advanced excel or maybe some intro to SQLPython or Tableau or maybe that really is not necessary

Do you have any advice",0

3irO29PJQHs,Omg so glad I found your videos  They are EXACTLY what I needed for questions Ive been having  Praying you see my last comment on working completely remotely and I can get your feedback on that or maybe a direction on where to go who to ask to make sure I can get a job as a Data Analyst that is completely remote and will allow me to work outside the US before I continue to pursue it too much more  Im flying through the Google course now  so interesting and just wanting to learn more and more  Thanks for all the great info,1

When I created my travel channel I just really enjoyed creating content editing creating scripts monitoring the performance etc I started to research how to get into tech and started learning SQL not realizing I used similar skills before

After days of research Ive become even more interested in creating projects based on data Recently started the google data analyst cert and Im loving it so far

BIUFr9srS78,"Hi Alex you really are an inspiration My cliff notes story is I had a kid young and never finished my bachelors but over time was able to at least finish my associates  all though it is a complete mess of courses with no focus I got a job about 10 years ago that was in a B2B call center Small company A couple years in I was helping with a project and the owner liked my excel skills and I was able to move into a position that cleaned prepped and loaded data for projects Over time I learned little things here and there with sql some Marcos in excel to help automate some reports I did I had a report that took hours I got down to about 15 minutes   
So I have just been there since but I am trying to grow my skills because I feel like I just know small pieces of a bunch of different things I have just felt stuck for the last few years
Your story inspires me to push and just dedicate the time to learn and do projects and make a portfolio Because in the end no one can take away your knowledge And knowledge is power and opportunity

BIUFr9srS78,Pepper Your story is so inspiring to me I recently graduated with my bachelors in applied math and I do have some experience with SQL python and R However I think my self doubt has prevented me from applying to data analyst positions because I think I am not good enough or dont know enough Im convinced I need to be an expert before applying which doesnt seem like the case based on your story I have an unrelated job at the moment and Im trying to work on my skills on the side Im hoping in 2022 I will gain confidence and end the year in a data analyst role,0

BIUFr9srS78,"Hello Alex 
Thanks for all your content believe its very concise and valuable to anybody 

Id like to ask you and everybody else who could help some suggestions regarding how to move
Goals
 Work as Data Analyst and maybe going on to something more Data science related but thats to be thought
 Work remotely I dont have any particular wish concerning the country Remote cause I wanna move on an island D 
 gettin paid more compared to now who wouldnt D

My Background
 Im 32yo even if I dont have it written on my resume and people think Im 8year younger  D
 4y experience as Business Analyst doing Functional analysis an testing in banking field
 knowledge of Excel SQL and basics of Python Tableau ETL processes
 Bachelor degree in Economics where I got enough quantitative knowledge especially Stats
 Attended the Google Data Analytics 6 months course 
 languages proficiency in Eng Italian native some French and German too


Thoughts
Ive tried some courses in a way or in another and I think that Im tired to attend anything in which I always have to do the same basic things since I think they wont get me anywhere 
I wonder if I should attend something thats more seriours and tough rather than a simple coursebut still what and taught by who 
Its then ok for me to pay 2040 a month for a course even 10002000 for a full course but only if it really gives me a good boost 
Maybe I should gather selftaught experience workiung on Kaggle datasets and then try to apply to a newbie job even parttime 
What would you think about getting into a low exp parttime job Do you think I could ever be chosen 

Anything I would do now is something I woulds start to do parttime since still got a fulltime job even if I got plenty of sparetime because Im not always full of tasks and I work remotely 

Then would it have any sense to think to go on into Data science or would it take too much time wo master

I know it can seem pretty confusionary but working with data is something I truely prefer over Functional stuff but since I had to start working I took what the market offered me back then  

SoSuggestion Is there anybody else who got the same problem

Thanks in advance

Z7hPEwCzk2s,i want to download the raw file but it is  not dowloading from github please help me,-1
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"I got this solution to value error from the net

When using XLOOKUP with multiple rows the result may be an array of values rather than a single value If you enter the formula in a single cell and the result is an array it will return a VALUE error
Solution To handle the array result you need to enter the formula as an array formula by pressing CtrlShiftEnter after typing the formula This will enclose the formula in curly braces  and allow it to return multiple results
For example if you want to get the corresponding values from columns O and P for each matched row in column I you can use the following array formula
XLOOKUPA3 I2I10 O2O10P2P10



and it worked for me",0

0156  The project uses an Airbnb dataset specifically the Seattle Airbnb open dataset with listings pricing and reviews
0253  The data has been consolidated into one CSV file and made available on GitHub for ease of access
0429  Understanding the data columns is crucial as not all data may be relevant for visualization
0604  Proper understanding of data relationships is essential for accurate data joining and analysis
0715  Data manipulation such as filtering and joining ensures accurate visualization creation
1050  Checking and confirming joins is vital to ensure correct data integration
1230  Removing unnecessary data helps optimize visualization creation and processing speed
1544  The projects use case involves optimizing Airbnb listings based on factors like location and pricing
1758  Creating visualizations such as price by zip code helps identify optimal locations for Airbnb listings
1839  Maps can be created using location data like latitude and longitude to visualize distribution and patterns
1920  When working with zip code data in Tableau ensure consistency and separate zip codes for better visualization
2113  Visualizations in Tableau can be enhanced by adding labels and average price information for better understanding
2320  Analyzing the best times for Airbnb listings can be done using time series data in Tableau to identify peak periods of demand
3252  The number of bedrooms significantly impacts Airbnb prices with larger homes commanding higher prices per night
3540  Visualizing competition for Airbnb listings by the number of bedrooms can provide insights into market demand and competition
4017  Completing the dashboard layout in Tableau by arranging visualizations and discussing its potential for answering questions and generating further inquiries
4154  Sharing the Tableau dashboard to Tableau Public for easy access and viewing by others encouraging viewers to explore the provided link for personal use or comparison
4307  Encouraging viewers to utilize the Kaggle data for additional fields and explore different data points to create unique dashboards and visualizations for their portfolios",1
zOR0-nygfDE,Your teaching style is awesome I appreciate your thoroughness  thank you,1
zOR0-nygfDE,thank you alex learned alot and created my tableau dashboard,0
zOR0-nygfDE,Airbnb has taken down the zipcodes from the updated datasets For anyone whos having trouble visualizing the map due to this you can make something similar by putting Longitude on columns and Latitude on rows Good luck everyone,0
zOR0-nygfDE,O wow thank you so much this is really insightful But a quick question how do i generate the zipcode i got the original data with the intention of redoing the entire project myself but there isnt any zipcode in the listings how can i get the zipcodes,1
zOR0-nygfDE,Thank you This was very informative Great introductory to Tableau,1
zOR0-nygfDE,"I have a question regarding the Avg price per bedroom chart Does it mean that for 6bedroom properties the average listed price per bedroom is 5848 It doesnt seem right for such a high price for just one bedroom It seems more reasonable to say that the average price for 6bedroom properties is 5848 pricing the bedrooms as a whole If this is the case shouldnt the title of the chart be something like Average price by bedroom number 
Its just a little confusing for me to analyze the data",0
zOR0-nygfDE,Great tutorial You are a great teacher I love how you solve errors and explain them as simple as it isI will continue with your bootcamp and other courses you have on your channel Congrats Alex,1
zOR0-nygfDE,guys i am not able to save the project it says free tablue limit is 15M how i can save this data,0

A4SVUF-fTwc,great work thank you,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Hi Alex I just wanted to say that your tutorials are amazing I recently took a data analytics course on Coursera that covered Tableau but your tutorial provides much more detailed explanations and features Thank you for what you do,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,files cant be downloaded on GitHub,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great video,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,where is the excel file,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Wow Joins I am enlightened,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,i watched the full SQL series beforehand so that lecture was A piece of cake,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great thanks,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,I did not know that Dwight earns almost the same as michale scott XD,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,THANKS,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,But like if i have null in my tableau it means I was doing something wrong in my SQLExcel,-1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Hello Aled sir Thank you so much for this tutorial I learned tableau in a very easy way I was facing a problem for 2 months and by these 5 parts I got it Thank you to adding each feature especially you are elabarating each types like average sum count why they using Good job,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,ahahah Assistant to the Regional Manager for Dwight love it,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Very good video with a great explanation thanks,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,I was so scared of joins but I have learned joins from your sql video in my semester break  Now joins are on my finger tips Since my concept are clear  this video was so easy to follow up,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great summary of joins I love the way you explain all of these concepts and functions so clearly It makes learning wayyyyy more fun As always THANK YOU,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,I have already learned a lot about joins from your sql course and other sql courses but in this video the part where you join the demographics and job title tables via employee name is such a clear and clever way of explaining again how the joins work It consilidated my understanding for joins Way to go alex,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you for this tutorial I am really learning a lot Apart from this tutorial but Mr Alex you are really good looking which gives some of us hope to keep on learning,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank You Alex I am mastering Tableau because of you,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you Alex,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,not a sheer one,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Any chance of explaning please the benefits of joining a table to itself in Tableau and how thats useful,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Im sincerely grateful for the video I have learnt something new joins today God bless you,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Apparently since this video has been posted theyve updated Tableau Now it spits out all the join info for you automatically Im going to do many things but complain aint one of them,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Hahaha Alex I just want to say You explained JOINs better than the Google Course,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,orrrr just use sql,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Not able to download the file from git,-1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Arent joins easiest  best in SQL then in excel power query  least in Tableau,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Im unable to download the join file from github,-1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Im not sure to understand why not simply doing relations instead of joins  still new to Tableau but experienced with PowerBI,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Big thanks for your video Alex,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Thanks so much Alex 
However I need help My joined table is not showing but rather its saying data preview unavailable what do I do please 
Pov I am using Tableau public",1
A4SVUF-fTwc,I watched the whole tutorial This is much appreciated thank you,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Done,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Alex you explained the joins very clearly Thank you so much,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Alex you look much better without those glasses   What I do not understand about this example is  Does it assume that the user is aware or unaware of the missing data  I would have to think that if one was aware of the missing data the better option is to simply update the original data source so if the user were unaware of the data issue what is your suggestion as to how this would materialize during the selection of Joins  In this example I believe you were searching for it only because you were aware of it so just questioning how obvious it might be for the average unaware user Thank you,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great vid At first I hated everything about joins BUT since I learned them its make Tableau so much easier Keep the vid coming your amazing,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,love the fact that you play League of Legends,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Oh you play League of Legends Nice to know lol,1

A4SVUF-fTwc,Alex The Goat,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,1330 man Michael Scotts salary is super low for being the boss man   lol  Great tutorial Alex,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Understandably explained thank you,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Where do we get the Tableau Joins file at    Help      Are we supposed to be following along  Where is the file at    Thanks in advance,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Love the reference from The Office with character names haha,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Just realising that those where The Office employees Awesome,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Alex now that we know you play League of Legends what rank are you,-1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Your tableau join file has an xlsx extension It does not download correctly Maybe you meant xls,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,Loved the fact that you are using tables with information about the characters from the office I like you more just for that,1
A4SVUF-fTwc,How do we join the data if they are from two separate files,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,so you made the joins but for the visualisation you didnt use it correct  or am i understanding this wrong,-1
A4SVUF-fTwc,when will be the remaining part is going to be uploaded,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hi
Can you make a video on difference between Busi Analyst and Management information systems
Really confused about these 2",-1
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hi Alex
But off topic but I have a question about learning my data analytics skills I am currently learning Python Now I saw you highly recommended the Google data analytics course Is it worth to do both courses simultaneously Or should I choose on or another Side note until the end of the year I can work full time on courses",1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Can you make an in depth video on data granularity and LODsok two  Found these topics of great importance for understanding Tableau and its power,1

A4SVUF-fTwc,"I have a question not about tableau I just wanted to ask you and this was your latest video
The question is there is a path in LinkedIn Learning to become a Data Analyst and it is for free and was there before Google Certificate and IBM too 
But no one talk about it and if it is good or not if it is updated or it is old for nowadays data analyst career and a comparison between the 3 of them
And a small tip for google and IBM we dont have jobs we do not have money to bay for Coursera why do not make the full course on your site if u do not get any revenue from Coursera",1
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you it helps me a lot,0
A4SVUF-fTwc,I wake up in the morning to a new tutorial vid Thank you,1

FnTunxd8tAM,Im currently interviewing for another data analyst role I rarely ever use SQL in my role mostly use Tableau GTM or GA Looker Studio other visual tools Ive had 12 years in creating high ROI digital marketing campaigns  so when I became a Data Analyt  it still baffles me why there needs to be so many visualization tools to make educated marketing decisions on how to optimize campaigns  Python SQL  GA4 R Tableau Power BI etc etc Truely in all my years doing digital analytics  we rarely ever used all these tools So many exceptional data anaysts are passed over because the hiring manager is hung up on specific tools that are rarely used and specific tasks  can be taught to almost anyone It feels like hiring managers are looking for unicorns but they just a need a reliable horse,1
FnTunxd8tAM,I have seen so many entry level jobs that ask for 3 to 5 years experience,1
FnTunxd8tAM,I am in one now like you were,0
FnTunxd8tAM,"I came across an entry level accounting job from concentra career choice Some of the job description contained the following

The Staff Accountant will be responsible for account reconciliations and other projects as assigned This position is entry level and requires someone with eagerness enthusiasm and problemsolving skills This position will report directly to the Accounting Senior Manager They will ensure the delivery of exceptional customer service by putting all customers internal and external first and displaying
 A healing focus
  A selfless heart
  A tireless resolve
I was like is this accounting position or am I also going to be doing mental counseling for l others and eventually myself",1
FnTunxd8tAM,"Other red flag phrases to look out for

Family environment  Gaslighting and other manipulation tactics runs rampant

Attention to details  Your boss will start the papertrail if you make even the most minor mistake

Must work well under pressure  You will be under chronic stress

Fastpaced  Unreasonable deadlines and never ending work

Multitasking  You will do the work of fifty people

Selfstarter  Boss is a boomer that believes in pull yourself from your own bootstraps when youre thrown to the wolves day one

Show initiative  Boss is a boomer that  believes in if theres time to lean theres time to clean instead of delegating work

Problem solver  Your competency will be questioned if you ask a single question

Fast growing and disrupting X industry  Expect mass layoffs",1

FnTunxd8tAM,I dont like working MF 85 so flexible hours sounds really attractive but Ive never done it before Would that be a good option in my case,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Being the first or only person in a role can be very tricky,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Please make a video on how to prepare for data analyst interviews,0
FnTunxd8tAM,215 Im on the 7th course of the Google Data Analytics Program and Im really afraid of that The course teaches a lot of skills and sometimes its just too overwhelming and Im always thinking that I will be expected to know EVERYTHING when I start applying for jobs and I have already forgotten a lot of what I learned in the previous courses,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Thank You Sir for your guidance Im a fresher looking for data analyst jobs and your videos about your experience give me a lot to guidance about what to look for in job profiles and how to build a good portfolio,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Very nice tipsreally appreciated,1
FnTunxd8tAM,"Hello Alex youve been truly an inspiration to me

Graduating straight from college I took a BootCamp and made my skills stronger in the technical term 

I do have a question regarding data analyst Would you label it more in the it field or financial field

Im currently interested in the it field to transition more into data analyst but I feel like being in accountant side of things help too",1
FnTunxd8tAM,Amazing video as always Alex unfortunately I was scammed into providing my personal information a few days ago on LinkedIn so be careful you guys I was too excited and quick to reply I questioned their request after I submitted my personal info which was a little too late so TAKE YOUR TIME AND ANALYZE EVERYTHING before going out any personal info,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Havent finished my course yet but just browsing LinkedIn jobs and Ive definitely seen all of these Especially 2 and 5 I see 2 in every field unfortunately 5 Ive seen labeled as a junior level a couple times Its frustrating Flexible hours does sound tempting to me but being on call is not,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Swear some people think were like data accountants lol,1
FnTunxd8tAM,I love this channels Im glad that I came across with your channel Keep the good work,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks Alex,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Please when will you conclude the Tableau series Thanks,1
FnTunxd8tAM,What is the difference between SQL SERVER MySQL  PostdgeSQL and others,0
FnTunxd8tAM,"These tips are great Id add if anyone you interviewed with resigns from the company during the hiring process you may want to decline any job offers LOL

This happened at least 3 times to me",1
FnTunxd8tAM,I have an idea as good as linked in but not the same I Need a Data Analyst or scientist app and web developer to help me to develop the idea Since this is an idea I will share everything in equal parts Who ever that is interested message me,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Complete the tablu series plzzzzz,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Hi Alex your videos always have huge amount of information and special thanks for that  As a Tableau learner if you make a video on some important terms in resume of tableau BI developer it will be really useful for us,1
FnTunxd8tAM,I use the exact same mouse Are you trying to copy my style Next thing you know I might shave my head to copy yours,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks for this video and always sharing your experiences Can you do a video on possible interview questions they may ask in a data analyst interview thanks,1
FnTunxd8tAM,If there is company values and you cant speak out  leave immediately,0
FnTunxd8tAM,They want a data scientist or data engineer but are saying they are looking for a Data Analyst,0
FnTunxd8tAM,"Alex I appreciate your mentorship on YouTube to those of us looking to break into data analytics

However Im a Nigerian Africa where the unemployment rate is skyhigh Because of this many companies list DA Job descriptions exactly like this In fact many give you age limits They tell you to have 35 yes experience as a Junior DA They expect you to have a Postgrad degree in statistics economics business CS et all making it hard to break into the DA field in my country 

Currently I just finished a DA bootcamp with a startup and Im about starting a 1 month internship with that startup 

I have my Bachelors and Masters degree in Pharmacology Switched into DA too late Im almost 30 

Really need your candid advice and encouragement because what works in your home country  USA may not work in Africa We dont have the luxury of choice here We take what jobs we can get even if the envt is toxic and the manager is Lucifers elder bro 

So what are your thoughts How can you tailor your videos to account for those in Africa",1
FnTunxd8tAM,You mentioned specific pitfalls for series A abs C but what about B I just got a phone screening with one and would love some questions I can ask to see if its a good fit Also awesome video thank you so much,1
FnTunxd8tAM,The most common one is listing the JD of a data scientist and label it as a data analyst so that they can get cheaper DS,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Almost all of these are exactly like what I applied for as a junior web developer position hahaCurrently switching my career so hopefully Ive learned it now and you confirmed it,1
FnTunxd8tAM,One general one to look out for  ask within this position who is the oldest member that is in that exact role Chances are if its less than 34 years it usually means either somehow people keep getting promoted out it gets burned out or kicked off,0
FnTunxd8tAM,"I agree with you 100 Places looking for junior rockstars ultimately want you to do everything and dont want to teach you the skills you dont necessarily have like Python

I think its important for people to check Glassdoor on interview reviews and job reviews For example is there a live coding session or is it a homework assignment Where the company tries to steal your work  My company has very bad reviews on their interview process due to a homework assignment that can take 3 hours and then they wonder why applicants are dropping out of the process",0
FnTunxd8tAM,"100 correct from my experiences I appreciate that you mention to still apply just ask about it then make the call 

I try to ask indirectly about work load I use things like what is the busy all hands on deck times for this team  that method has served me well 

Alex the mentor analyst",0
FnTunxd8tAM,Thank you  Those insights were quite helpful,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Woow  Omg this is exaactly the job description of a startup I joined a few months ago  It was for a prehiring internship I finished the internship and declined the offer,-1
FnTunxd8tAM,Great video Please make more portfolio projects,1
FnTunxd8tAM,This video is everything Literally everything you mentioned is exactly what Ive been seeing I cant get an opportunity tp save my life I saw a job post that was for a Jr DA and wanted 38 years of experience with everything a Data Scientist does I was puzzled About 90 of the jobs Ive seen want the world out of the DA,1
FnTunxd8tAM,ALMOST ALL jobs postings in greece are like this,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Can you make a video about the data analyst horror story if you havent already,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Great video Thank you,1
FnTunxd8tAM,"what are your thoughts on remote internships site by career up
is it worth it   Im still a student",0
FnTunxd8tAM,Any posting that mentions ninja or rockstar,0
FnTunxd8tAM,Great video Alex and thanks for posting it  I was thinking about you the other day tho and since you came from a psych backgroundI wonder if you had it to do over again would you have skipped your first job in the field if it meant waiting longer to become an analyst   I ask bc I have an accounting degree and going for a career pivot as well,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks Alex,1
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks,1

pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex

Im interviewing for a Data Analyst position and they want me to complete an exercise where I need to analyze a large dataset in Excel 42 columns 10 millions rows using Python or SQL  Then I have to present it Do you have any suggestionstips on the best way to do this  

Thanks for any feedback you can provide",1
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex how are you doing
I have a question to ask I have been googling it for a while now and the answers I find is either too old to be applied to 2021 or not well defined 
The question is is Chrome Os good for data analysis
There are a bunch of reasons why I prefer to buy a Chromebook to start my data analysis self teaching journey
1 I am extremely broke and Chromebooks are a bit cheaper
2 I kinda like the Linux way of doing things than the Windows
3 I like the ecosystem between Android and Chrome Os
I dont know to what extent how the slight differences between Excel and Sheets might affect me I would like to work with Sheets than with Excel
Please let me know at your leisure time how safe or unsafe it is buying and doing data science with a Chromebook 
I have another question in the pipeline but I feel like adding it to this one makes things lengthy So Ill come up with that next time Thanks 
And lo if you have a video or any document somewhere  answering my question please link me I think that will be much simpler for you",1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hi Alex a lot of big competitive and low tech market cities in Europe Australia and Canada have incredibly low success rates and awful applicationtointerview ratios for data jobs Some cities are so competitive they set the entrylevel minimum requirements to a masters degree and even then too many masters holders in lowtechjob cities like Toronto are sitting unemployed and switching to similar devIT roles just to make a living What do you recommend in those scenarios Is it worth moving to the US,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,Alteryx is an amazing tool and replaces the need to learn SQL Python or Data Science related coding The only problem is you need a company that can afford the license fees to get you a seat,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,"I love the content I have to disagree with the education I have 15 years analytics experience in the military built a portfolio but keep getting passed over for fresh college grads 65 job applications fromAug 8 through today  one job went to a 23 year old who didnt event know pivot tables in excel 
From my view to make it as self taught it is all about being at the right place at the right time Good luck with that For every Alex who I do appreciate nothing but appreciation from me there are 2000 others that are not given that chance Go get the education certification and anything else to help you stand out Keep trying dont quit  but stay realistic and get certifications",1
pL0jEjeM5hI,I wonder how long it takes to get a job after taking a data analysist course at a bootscamp like Faltiron on average,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,Lets assume i am total beginner in analytics I have very poor knowledge of Microsoft AccessShould i learn it or i can start with Sql right awayThank you for your answer in advance,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,As a Marine vet who is coming from Aviation data admin and worked as an Army contractor to now working towards my data analysis degree this is helpful Especially since right know college is a hard for me because I know from experience that while college is good OJT is the best teacher As you mentioned I also try to do other projects to have a small profile to show,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hey Alex can you recommend a python track alongside the google analytics cert,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hi Alex I just gotta say this is a awesome video Thank you I say this because it gives me a sense of hope and inspiration that I too can become a data analyst Im currently in an online school right now taking a course in data analytics Im also  taking a course in SQL  Im learning SQL on Microsoft SQL Server Im currently 5 months in on the data analytics course Im 2 months in learning SQL at another online school Im coming from working 30 years in the United States Postal Service   I wanted to start a new career that involves me solving problems and no more heavy lifting Amazon packages   Keep up the good work youre doing  Peace,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hey I have been following you for a bit and I wanted your advice because I was actually interested in BI analytics but I am not sure which master or certification online I should apply to I come from a total different background so I am kinda on the edge between the BI analyst or data analyst  Please help,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,I wanted to take this moment and truly appreciate how selfless you are you have made my college life a lot easier You are a life saver THANK YOU so much,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Very helpful information right here I didnt think much about he domain knowledge and now I know thats something very important to keep in mind thank you very much Alex for your excellent content,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thanks alex Been loving your content as a whole Very inspiring and very helpful at squashing imposter syndrome when it inevitably creeps up on a self taught analyst I havent been actively practicing my data tools and certainly needed this one Thanks again D,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hi Alex just wanted to say I recently found your page and am loving all of the advice and examples  Thanks for your hard work,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thanks for sharing this Very encouraging and inspiring to see these people coming from non analytics background and became a data analyst,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,How about power apps Is there a need to learn it to grow as data analyst,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hey Alex Id like to show my thanks and appreciation quickly before I get down to work Your channel has opened up a world of opportunity and potential to me You make high quality videos high quality in production but also content Youve drastically changed the way I think about data and the IT field whether through the topics you discuss the tutorials that you teach the references that you share and so much more I appreciate all the work and dedication youve done for us since the very beginning I hope to give back in return by watching all of your videos and someday buying your merch Sincerely from an aspiring 18year old data analyst,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thank you Alex This is more than an inspiration,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Alex Great timing my last interview mentioned Alteryx as a skill Id use on the job Will definitely watch this tonighttomorrow as I prep for interview 2

Thank you for all your content it has helped me tremendously as I transition into data analytics Do you have any advice for those of us who are getting interviews but havent yet gotten an offer Im still applying and studying putting myself out there but want to improve and get hired already Is it just a patience game and keep staying as positive as possible",1
pL0jEjeM5hI,Love that you all did not study data analytics in college because I for sure would not want to rack up more debt by going back for a second degree in data analytics I truly now believe it is about finding your resources and grinding Thank you,1
pL0jEjeM5hI,In terms of Data Analytics I have over 5 yrs working wAlteryx 5 wTableau and 9 wOBIEE BI literally 0 recruiters knocking on my door regarding these programs  If youre like me and you dont have SQL experience then youre nothing to recruiters,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hey I live in Allen TX too and also in the same field,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,"While Domain Knowledge is very important it is something that can be learned quicker  easier than the technical skills 

So if youre hiring someone who has most of the technical skills but not the domain knowledge dont count them out Just cause someone has domain knowledge doesnt always mean theyll be the better analyst 

At least thats been my experience in Analytics It might be easier for Analytics managers to think that way because its more convenientselfserving for them but doesnt mean its right 

As a matter of fact when you see an Analyst whos worked in multiple industries and done well then you know they must be good at learning",1
pL0jEjeM5hI,I appreciate that last question Im 44 I  explained to my wife that I can make a career change at my age Currently learning python for data analytics on udemy and working on projects  Thanks for the encouraging video,0
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thank you Alex,0
eg_5EAUXs5o,That has been my biggest issue trying to pick a domain Finance is my first idea or healthcare I do a lot of reading but Im leaning towards financefintech,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thanks a lot ALex,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,I am transitioning to data science right now I am not interested in any domain but I got one opening at a sports analytics firm in Berlin But there are very few players in the market of sports analytics and only one in entire Germany So that means less room to switch jobs for salary hikes and chances of boss turning toxic due to  domain niche would be more So I would target more generalist domains like banking or audit where tones of players are there in the market More room for growth and I will have a parachute ready incase work place turns toxic,0
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Thank you very much Alex for making a great and instructive video regarding a topic which often ignored in other data related channels It was really beneficial

Have a really quick question on this topic As you know there are many data consultancy firms which offer services to a many clients from a wide range of topics Do you think these firms are better place for a Jr Analyst position as you could get experience with different domains Then perhaps after 23 years you could focus on the ones you like most",1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Ah ok By domain you mean industry Which industry or type of business you want to be an analyst in I was thinking you were going to talk about technical domains and to specialize early in a combination of machineplatformlanguages Like chose Windows or Mac then choose Google of Microsoft and then choose their preferred suite of tools Get good in one combination before you branch out into something else Does that make sense Or should you just git gud at it all,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,As devils advocate a mistake you can also make is choosing a domain too early If you specialize too early in a young career you can limit your opportunities down the road I think there is a balance,0
eg_5EAUXs5o,Hey Alex do you think its still suitable if its done in reverse like getting a degree in a domain finance then learning about data analytics,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thank you so much You have really helped to things in perspective  I look forward to you the complete video,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Alex if you could explain how data analysis works in health care system then it would be great,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Happy New year   How can I register for the mentorship program,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,So agree on this  I decided early on to stay in the HR Domainfunction and it is was a good choice,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thanks for the advice,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,This is an awesome point Alex Domain expertise is almost as important as tech expertise,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,I would be wary of throwing salary numbers without considering cost of living size of company reputation of company etc Im an incoming Data Analyst at a large company making 100k first time in the domain with 15 of total YOE Glad youre discussing these sorts of topics though super interesting,1

eg_5EAUXs5o,Hey Alex So Im currently an HVAC tech and I started looking into data analytics as a full time career I am going to be enrolling in Googles data analyst course as well as doing a python course and 365 data science course on udemy My two major questions are what domains would you say are the best paying ones and what are some other areas or skills that would be good to study to put on a resume I do have a couple years of coding C and C experience from university but nothing else really skills related that would make me stand out on a resume from all the other Google course candidates,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,is telecommunications a good domain,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,Do you think 365 Data Science plus doing projects are enough to prepare for a job,0
eg_5EAUXs5o,"thank you Alex people tend to ignore this although it is extremely important for them Ive been wondering
1 in this context Ive been thinking about Finance can you make a video on what should I learn in order to break into this domain does a Master in finance worth it  or it would be better to learn by my own 
2Im majoring in computer sciencebachelor in my last year and Im seeking an internshipentry level job in data analytics during college Ive been working on software projects onlylastly I switched my interests into data analytics so I only have a certification from google as a junior data analyst and two minor case studies project stone in my certification should I put my previous projects in my resume and start applying now or work on other data projects and then put them instead of SW projects",1

eg_5EAUXs5o,Youre a godsend Thank you for making these extremely informative videos,-1
eg_5EAUXs5o,The next month is too long but I understand I think age is an important factor to consider on this topic if youre younger you can explore domains but an older individual with more responsibilities will have to put more consideration in selecting a domain especially if they are just entering the field,1
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Im just starting out with my career switch to data analysis Im teaching myself the bigpicture of what DA is and then I will dive into courses

Im really interested in renewable energy I like to keep track of it in my free time It is also a growing field I hope when Im done studying I can find something in that domain",1
eg_5EAUXs5o,To Alex and people in the comments section what domain can a Data Analyst or a Data Scientist be in that has to do with Psychology,0

ebjDwX8sUMk,Alex great video as always love this series Filling a huge gap in the Tableau community I have one bit of critical feedback which is the way youre using show me to get some final results Its generally okay especially for beginners but the issue with it is it obfuscates why the charts work the way they do For example on your pie chart to box and whisker plot click it changed the chart but theres probably about 8 to 10 steps it did for you including adding what tableau considers a reference line and if you dont clock those steps its actually a huge blocker for so many people when they go to build this charts later down the line As a trainer I see a lot of approaches that people have where they build a chart then use show me but then get stuck on the final mile I have a video just highlighting this issue here  but again this is meant as friendly feedback and Im being 110 pedantic about this,1

ALTERNATE WAY instead of making the request and getting the html page download the page manually from browser and save it in TXT file use the TXT file to pass the html page to your soup1 variable and continue the video basically bypass the step where you request the page and getting caught by Amazon

HiOtQMcI5wg,"man ive been battling with the bot blocker from amazon and also some scraping issues with price because the website display was changed a while after this video was uploaded but Ive managed to pull it off so i hope this might help those recent viewers who might be as confused as me when I started writing this code on my own

apparently you need to divide the second cell so you need to run the soup1 first before you run the soup2 then for the price you need to pull three part of span classapricesymbol span classapricewhole and span classapricefraction and combine it together into 1 new variable price then you need to clean it using strip and replace to clean the whitespaces and ns

hope this helps",1

We were invited for an interview along with the remaining competitor who turned out to be PwC We walked in and they were immediately Oh its you They were going to ask interview questions  using my book as the reference They saw the other person I brought with me and they knew him well too I planned it that way We got the deal Later for marketing research I asked the client where PwC was judged to be better than us They said that PwC had really nice brochures",0

CUa30M_FPhk,Crazy 105150 k per year sounds crazy While football player could get that amount in a week I know it is different thing But still There is so much unbalance resources spread in the world The person back door that make improvement to this world to become better really get paid by a peanut,0
CUa30M_FPhk,"120k a year is pretty low for a senior consultant in a technical role especially for a really large consulting firm like PwC

Consulting is a notoriously intense line of work Despite what they told you in the interview you always go into those jobs knowing youre going to be working long hours They know that and they compensate you accordingly They retain you with money not by making you happy And you end up having to sacrifice plenty of things if you want to keep that salary

The fact that you dont know this makes me feel you would have burnt out quickly because of misaligned expectations There just arent enough hours in a week to run a youtube channel spend time with your family sleep and have a consulting job",1

CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulations on the new managerial position  I just started at one of the big 4 about a month ago  My interview process was pretty much identical though I am in a different tech related field  One of the reasons why they are SO into domain knowledge rather than technical knowledge is that to be honest there are hordes of people who can do the technical part but it is more difficult to find someone who can sit in front of a HUGE client and really dig out all of the details of the project from them  Then that same person needs to relay that information to the developers so they can do the coding work
Consultants at the big 4 level are more advisors and SMEs Subject Matter Experts than coders

CUa30M_FPhk,Why therere too many interviews,1
CUa30M_FPhk,"I agree that just stonewalling a recruiter on salary can result in wastes of time however I still dont think you should give a range because you could be low balling yourself If a recruiter is pushing for a number Id ask the recruiter what the salary range is for the position and will just say yes or no if that range is worth moving forward without them knowing if you are jumping with joy or they need to hit the top of the range to get you  but this way you still get the desired result of both of you knowing you arent wasting anyones time

UGF49YZZRNc,"Or like Chandler from Friends he accepted a job offer that required horseback riding skills and signed up for horseback riding lessons DDD 
Halfjoking halfserious but many companies have such a low level of HR knowledge awareness that they could make a problem out of something so simple they dont understand that the technical part is the easiest part when you have the right attitude talents DNA etc",1
UGF49YZZRNc,Thanks for having been part of my data journey,1
UGF49YZZRNc,"Wow
The best video I have watched from Nigeria

I will start applying as soon as possible",1

UGF49YZZRNc,"How about this combo   SQL Python Tableau   or SQL R Tableau  But I feel these 3 are not enough You should have spreadsheets under the belt as well both google sheets and excel There is a redundancy of skills here from my point of view and that is because I am speaking as an outsider At the moment I dont know how companies actually utilize these above skillsets 
SQL can manipulate  large amount of data  very quickly and efficiently so there should be no need for excel manipulations Once data is cleaned in SQL and ready for analysis it can be imported in Excel for whatever reasons for reports to share with management so you dont need Excel that much of course it is good to have the deep skills in it Similarly what is Python used for Mostly for automation doing complex calculations fast They say it is used in data science model like numpy etc I am not familiar with it yet I am learning Python at the moment and doing the object oriented part but not sure if OOP is really needed for data analysis  Tableau you defninitly need It produces very good visualization One should go deep in it The google sheet chart capability sucks",1

UGF49YZZRNc,"my case is also same as Alex i have completed google data analytics in nov2022 from that time i dig almost every area of SQl server i think  some times they just want fundamental knowledge for entry level jobits been 15 days of starting pandas as i get confident i start getting applying for jobs 
some peoples are like that until they get satisfied they never step forwardbut its a valid point by Alex in video if you have strong fundamentals do start for job applying",1
UGF49YZZRNc,I think what I need to the confidence to do a project to add to my portfolio by myself  Ive watched and completed the portfolio projects you have on your page but getting started on my own with data is hard for me,1
UGF49YZZRNc,I personally havent move on to a visualization tool like tableau or Power Bi but my question is when you say learn two investment in Python has far steeper learning curve so why isnt that mention Is the assumption that the weight is equal should I just learn the two topic that require the least amount of hours to be job ready,0
UGF49YZZRNc,"I had an interview I thought went great but wasnt really asked any technical questions I thought I was going to get the 2nd interview but had to hear from the recruiter I wasnt It put me in a funk for some reason

UGF49YZZRNc,Dont forget R So many aspiring data analysts are only picking up Python which makes it much easier to get into companies that use R as their go to programming language for statistical analysis and visualization,1

UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex could you make a video about what maths notions are needed on being a data analystbusiness analyst vs data scientist 
Im still deciding between being a data analystbusiness intelligence by the age of 24 vs becoming a data scientist by the age of 2627 Im 22 currently",1
UGF49YZZRNc,Hi Alex Ive been watching your videos for 12 weeks now Question Do you think its necessary to know BOTH PowerBI and Tableau before applying It seems like if you can learn one you can learn the other and it also seems like the one youll use at work depends entirely on what company you end up working for I figure that focusing on just one would let me get to the point where Im ready to apply more quickly while still showing that I have visualization skills,1
UGF49YZZRNc,Is Data Analyst an evergreen career I am still in dilemma of picking my career path Data Science or Web development,0
UGF49YZZRNc,This is great Alex Side note  its giving off a very Binging with Babish kind of video vibe which is also good,1
UGF49YZZRNc,This is on point I made sure to focus my resume on data analyst relevant skills only and it at least landed me a job interview which was the precursor to me getting my job One thing that makes you stand out from other tech channels on youtube is the fact that you explain the why you need to know a certain technical skill This really helps keep motivation when learning such a skill I would recommend that in a future video you explain in more depth why you choose these core skills Excel SQL Tableau or Power BI Python and what people should focus on when learning each of these tools because they are so vast and the information overload can easily feel overwhelming,1
UGF49YZZRNc,Do you offer any coaching services I have about 3 years of SQL work exp in the healthcare field and I want to land a Data Analytics job In the nearby big city but it feels so impossible and Im so lost,-1
UGF49YZZRNc,Hello Alexcould u pls tell me how stressful is a data analyst job,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Did I overdo it with the sound effects Maybe

Do I regret it No",1
aLp-6C-p-T0,No one made video about this but this is must video for so many people to understand that y only courses are not going to help you need to do actual practical work and to work on skills,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,During the past year I have been taking multiple classes I felt that courses are not the best way to learn something You have to learn by doing In 2024 I want to increase the number of projects that i do,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,I just started learning SQL last Wednesday and Im a person who can get stuck in a course loop too Im at that point where I know I need to start playing around with datasets since I have a decent grasp of at least the very basic commands now but I guess Im a bit timid So I appreciate this message very much I think I watched this video at the right timing for me to hear it Thank you Alex for all your insights and wisdom,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,I agree Start doing courses and finishing them Once you have done enough do some guided projects After you do enough do some of your own projects and build your portfolio,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,There comes a time when knowledge needs to be translated into actual use,0

aLp-6C-p-T0,Great message Agreed Thank you,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,I feel like there is a balance you want to learn the fundamentals properly but then you have to apply them to understand how things work in practice I think this is an iterative process learning something apply it be confused about another aspect take a course in that apply it confused about another thing read about it in forums apply itetc,-1

aLp-6C-p-T0,Hey Alex Thank U for that insightful wisdom  I am concerned on the type of statistics class someone must take for Data Analysis  Is that a course on Udemy,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Alex i took more than 10 courses on Data analyst and I cant focus on anyone  Thanks man  I needed this video,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Hi Alex Im from Indonesia This is my first time learning about data analysts My background was a programming bachelors degree but I have no experience of programming or analyst In my country theyre always looking for experience for an analyst so I think its really hard for me to find a job or even an internship Ive taken a few courses too and I think it didnt help a lot Yes I need practice a lot of it Thanks for your video Ill try my best to keep doing my best as an analyst and put it in my portfolio,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Thank you so much I bookmarked your links Love this stuff Thank you thank you,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,The problem is that I dont know how to get started with a project Its challenging to marry what Ive learned with what I need to do with what I know,1

aLp-6C-p-T0,Very true You need to apply what you learn in the courses straight away in your work or projects otherwise its just head knowledge and soon forget it,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,TrueI only do this because HR likes to see this in your resume if not of this I would busy myself selfstudying documentations books etc And not courses or certificate,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Do you think taking courses is a by product of the job hiring process as a whole where credentialing is the primary motivator for hiring as compared to experience,1

I was told in two interviews that I was lying and dont know what I was talking about Thats cos I wasnt certified Maybe one should stop with online courses and rather focus on joining a community through certification or being chartered",1

aLp-6C-p-T0,I have a shit load of courses on Udemy and Ill take your advice at face value Ill finish them all eventually but 23 at a time and then apply the knowledge in a few projects,-1

aLp-6C-p-T0,Yeah thats TrueNow i should Start a Course on How to stop Taking Courses,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Same is true for college degrees  So many people get a college degrees as if that is all they need to get a good job You need to get actual handon experience also,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,I am the same  literally on my last of 11 for the past 6 mths lol and I made up my mind about actively practicing now that I found an area I can use to maintain my career as a main skill  and the rest as knowledge I wanted to make sure I can always understand all the departments I deal with and planned very specific courses to be of value  so after personally developing that understanding and im now I can focus on actively practical skillset and apply them as much as possible,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Thank you Alex Timely word,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Great channel brother How can I get in touch with you for a 1 on 1,1

aLp-6C-p-T0,Youtube  how to stop taking courses,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,I think course is only good for jump start when you really a beginner acquiring the basic knowledge and then the rest is about practice more,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,At a certain point books are better They go into way more detail If you read a few of the best books on a programming language and apply it you are well on your way to become an expert,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Watching this and getting inspired to take course on data analysis,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Main idea that I took away diversify your knowledge of how you apply what you learned in your courses Seek ways of applying knowledge to grow your understanding and dont trap yourself to a course Courses are not bad though and good to start out,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,This video made me realise that I was doing it wrong,-1
aLp-6C-p-T0,"What about taking new courses about new skills or knowledge

I mean I get your point regarding I took 8 courses on Python BTW why did you take so many of them  but I was wondering whether one course per new skill and a fair amount of exercises afterwards was a good approach",1
aLp-6C-p-T0,I feel thats a bad clickbait This will discourage good teachers to come out with innovative methods I learned all my coding from courses and wonder if the teacher would have ever taught if not paid This is individuals responsibility to finish the course,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Imagine only taking courses and not practicing with what you have learned,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Im not a coder but I do takes a lot of courses Skillshare Udemy Coursera Masterclass Domestika you call it  Im on art  design course purgatory lol,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,I hate course Simply because it will make you lazy to do things on your own I prefer self learning and ask people when I hit a wall Or you can ask someone to teach you so much better than pay a course,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,So Praxis then Praxis   The synthesis of theory and practice ie you practice the theory of what you learnt and develop the skill Basically practice makes permanent The more you do it the better you get,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,My Udemy library is starting to look like my Steam library Lots of stuff unplayed,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Shows an ad to buy a new course,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,We stil need to take courses that are neccesary They are like tool boxes Once we have those we can use those in our projects Without courses we find it difficult to start,-1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Any course worth its salt will invite you to embark in a project right after it,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,This is good advice Ive been quite the opposite throughout my career and that fact is one of the primary reasons I have been so successful Ill take a course every so often but then I immediately turn to real world experience to truly solidify the knowledge in my brain Until you see the technology implemented top to bottom in a system that actually does something useful it often remains an abstract concept that needs to take root There is no teacher quite like experience,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,This is happened to me now Im trying more practical approach,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Great advise thanks a lot and also great to see so many people on the path of selfimprovement D,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,It makes sense because companies that provide courses make their money by providing courses And the more courses you take the more money the providers make,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Your example of For Loops hit me Im still not sure how they work lol,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,"According to Andrew Huberman a neuroscientist at Stanford THE best way to learn is to make and fix mistakes during repeated practice on a single detail under different scenarios as many as possible and mistakes are essential in the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills However ironically taking courses basically takes all that mistakemaking away from you So its pretty reasonable to say that taking courses is an overrated way of learning

By the way I highly recommend Andrew Hubermans podcast Check it out if youre interested",1

About scraping as I can understand scraping from Facebook is not permittet anymore without the expressed consent of facebook

Me Logs into Coursera and see only 1 course with 10 completion

Me haz sad",0
aLp-6C-p-T0,"This is what Ive been calling a tutorial hell Ive been there I always remind myself how I wasted like half a year on doing python over and over I get reminded of this anytime I see some free courses on a subject on YouTube and people being extremely positive and happy about them in the comments while they are literally just learning for loops over and over 

Also there is a severe lack of intermediate and advanced courses that would either force you to do much harder projects or challenges or give you a lot more information on optimization of your code and deep dive into the softwarehardware interactions like memory allocation and so on",1

aLp-6C-p-T0,Can you recommend a course about quitting courses,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,I completely agree I learn by doing however I did learn some tricks while taking the google certificate the best way for me to understand is by doing stuff that is part of the job,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Gee who would have thought being a mindless idiot about something doesnt work Paid courses arent designed to teach you  theyre designed to get you to do more courses Theres SOOOO MUCH free python stuff which is put out not to make money,0
aLp-6C-p-T0,Yeah a person gets good by doing So if you are say learning Python you do TONS of Python coding and consult online resources when you need to know something or answer a question There is also a talent factor  in anything  which will limit the results of any individual You cant learn or buy talent you are born with it Things like hard work and experience simply develops the talent a person is born with it but wont surpass it What this means is that you can never use courseshard workexperience to COMPENSATE your way beyond your natural talent level Thats just a fact of life Your potential in ANY field is limited by your natural abilities in that field You develop that maxpotential mostly by doing with the right amount of instructionstudying mixed in,1

Thank you",1
aLp-6C-p-T0,To be honest YouTube crash course and free videos and Google searches when the problem comes in real life taught me a lot rather than courses on Coursera and Udemy Just my views but yes real life problem are best,1
aLp-6C-p-T0,Come up with a project and then learn the skills that you need to complete that project For example in learning python I came up with my own hangman game There were a lot of skills I either didnt have or didnt fully understand that were necessary to complete the project so I looked them up as I coded Slowly I learned new things or finally understood how something worked once I was applying it to my unique situation and learning how changes affected how that code worked,0

iPYVYBtUTyE,Ah hi Im doing this video in 2025 and its got completely different result and I honestly looking at my result following your video steps to steps and the data correlation doesnt make sense,1
iPYVYBtUTyE,Completed 4th one  I will do complete the rest tooo,0
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Something to note here for any future watchers Around the 17min mark or so Alex is correcting the year but its been some time and the original data is different so his line no longer works seamlessly 
You can substitute his line
dfyeearcorrect  dfreleasedastypestr4

With the following
import re
def extractyeartext
    match  researchrbd4b strtext
    return matchgroup if match else None
dfyearcorrect  dfreleasedapplyextractyear

to achieve the same effect The data changed from a format of YYYYMMDD to Month DD YYYY Location and so the regex above will search for any grouping of 4 numbers together and return that group 

Note Alex is incorrect in saying that the IMDB data is incorrect for these years They just mean something different You can confirm by checking IMDBs Help section Essentially Release Date refers to the public release of the film but year refers to first ever airing and includes any festival release dates I think a more appropriate response would be to change the names of the columns to something like First Appearance and Public Release or something along those lines I opted to not include this particular section in my portfolio project for that reason 


That said Alex has made a fantastic series of videos that are phenomenally helpful and organized mistakes here and there are human and the effort to put together this series with far than make up for any minor mistakes throughout this series",1
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Even though I barely understood the code I used this to get the corrected year

dfyearcorrect  dfreleasedstrrsplit  n1str0strsplit n1str1

Then I used this to convert it to a numeric value
dfyearcorrect  pdtonumericdfyearcorrect errors  coercefillna0astypeint64

Good luck

PS I downloaded the dataset on 13032025 and the rows seem to have been updated Also we now have missing values do check the comments on how to deal with them",1

Thank you for creating such useful content

iPYVYBtUTyE,DOUBT Hello Sir I am trying to use matplotlib inline in vscode But it is showing error Can u please resolve this,0
iPYVYBtUTyE,I think that at 1710 they made a mistake naming 2 different columns with the same name because one was supposed to be the year release while the other year of production The year of production actually matches with the year of release when they start to shoot the film at the begining of the year and release it at the same year Sometimes production starts at the end of the year so thats why the release is the year after that So as a beginner and your student is it good to directly rename that coumn so we can have some extra interesting data to work on Sorry for my bad ensligh but I hope that Ive explained it well and thanks a lot for all your amazing videos I cant never stop to say thank to you,0

iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hi Alex great job you are doing in your channel thank you very much I just wanted to say if it might help anybody who is watching you  because I believe that you already know it after two years that a correlation measures the reaction of one value against the movement of another value For this both values need to be able to move and get bigger or smaller something that letters and names in consequence cannot do neither can letters or names disguised as numbers because those are static too hence the non numeric correlations showed in the video are false 

This problem could just be a mess up in any project but in a project that is our portfolio our showroom it will only show how much of a data analyst we are NOT 

Kindly study a work around to this statistical problem which is not to change letters by numbers So many great developers behind Pandas would have implemented it many years ago",1

I just enrolled in Courseras Data Analyst course today so well see how far I can go from here Wishing everyone pursuing a career in tech or data analytics much success you got this",1
dMHWOhgzUhU,"To me and future data analyst probably what you are looking for is how do you place or frame yourself as someone who is ready for the role especially coming from non it formal education customer service or other non it role you old etc but all you have are EXTENSICE years of experienc doing non related work

Alex tell you to 

1 Put whatever related to Data work on the top
2 What data related work you ask Well since you have no experience then portfolio and certs are your only game changer cause why you ask next TA or Rec dont waste their time listening to our sob transitioning stories So dont waste any opportunity 
3 What will happen is that they will be drawn to the skills you acquired and how you apply Skills you ask Sql excel power bi some related tools like ERH etc if you are into it Apply Thru projects esp with real data sets answering real business concern 
4 LinkedIn Best place so far  optimize your profile by making your profile open to work and choose data analyst or datarelated role as your role Why this platform you ask Cause you NEED THE HELP OF THE RECRUITOR instead of blind apply on other platforms You want the TA to find you and vice versa Also connect to recruitors It doesnt kill you Rec will ask where you are in the stage and find you the most suitable role you can apply or the most suitable company
5 Technical interview  Test skills 

Ok thats all i guess I hope this is still relevant in 2025 march 18th",1

RJw-GSXXguA,Dan Wes Power BI courses are very good because he clearly explains DAX without which Power BI cant be used to its full potential He seems to be quite an underrated teacher on Udemy,1
RJw-GSXXguA,Does Tableau public work for the course or needed a paid version thanks,0
RJw-GSXXguA,Alex The Analyst  Could you please mention the course which you have pointed at 542 in the video some course related to tableau projects Could you please let me know what course it is Waiting for your response sir,0
RJw-GSXXguA,Whats the course you are mentioning at time frame 542 something like for projects on Tableau Could you please let me know what course it is,0
RJw-GSXXguA,Currently taking the Power BI course Still half way but learn a lot from it,0
RJw-GSXXguA,Power BI with no DAX is like going on holiday and not leaving the airport Tableau has alot more limitations in data modelling Data blending sucks and is a shadow of a real relationship Tableau requires alot more hacks and has less expandibility If you are just using to show so data without any modelling then both are equal any more interesting and you start hitting walls,1

One more step is done project is completed  
First of all Alex Thank you so much for your courses and your time spent on it Personally for me your educational materials appeal to me much more than other sources I use for my education Thank you Thank you Thank you  
Just let you know it is especially intriguing when I am working on data with approximately 2 years gap from your video and I see how much the picture is different from 2021 in the term of data I also was curious to compare the forecast made in 2021 concerning further infection rate according to an analytical tool in Tableau and my observation is that the projection was a little bit overestimated compared to what Globe has nowadays 
I am going further to your course Thanks Much
Best regards Andrei",1

qfyynHBFOsM,Im doing this in Oct 2021 and apparently one of the code chunks where you need to convert newvaccinations column to integer the sum value now has exceeded 2147483647 So instead of converting it to int you will need to convert to bigint Hope this helps everyone,0
qfyynHBFOsM,My data set when downloaded and opened in excel only has 3 columns  Please help,0
qfyynHBFOsM,For anyone wondering if this still applies in 2025 August I am happy to report it does I completed all four projects and made a portfolio web page for my resume and landed an analyst job in three months this was full time job hunting as I was unemployed Thanks Alex,1

qfyynHBFOsM,"Im 15 min into project 1 and suuuuper impressed by how up to date you have kept these videos like you uploaded links in description for the dataset which arent available on the site in video but i was able to keep along with the video because you shared a copyfile of the dataset on the github repo  

You also tried to explain stuff that experienced people would understand on their own like  tables and import issues Really appreciative of the efforts and time youve put into this 3 3 3",1
qfyynHBFOsM,Am doing this on July 30th 2025 for those who cant import the excel into sql here is what worked for me change to excel file to csv dos then right click ur database choose tasks then import flat file browse ur file then next uncheck the box that says use rich data next then change the data types to float but testunits should be nvarchar50 now its 1 also population should be bigint not int or float if you do that then VOILA the file will be in during tables hope this works for everyone,1
qfyynHBFOsM,"Hi Alex firstly thank you for this project and the guided video 
My question comes in at around 4027 if we are trying to get TotalDeaths by Continent shouldnt we take the Latest Death count from each country and then SUM them up according to continent For example in the case of NA shouldnt we take the MAX number of total deaths of Canada and add that to the MAX number of total deaths of USA and then group them by the North America Continent
I wrote a whole CTE but I do not know if I just over complicated Would love any help",1

qfyynHBFOsM,Useful,1
qfyynHBFOsM,"Took me 25 hours to get to 10 minutes of this video to set up everything But it was worth it as I will never forget these steps

Steps I followed
1 Downloaded MySQL watching  
2 But did not know I had to install Workbench and so I tried reinstalling the whole thing again
2 Realized I had to click to install workbench and other stuff
3 Then realized Alex was using MS SQL Server Management Studio in this video so I closed Workbench and installed that
4 But did not think that I had to install the MySQL Server to make a connection For 15 minutes I was trying to connect to some nonexistent server
5 Went through his another video to do so 
6 Was trying to import excel file but kept getting an error but different errors than what Alex got So I checked with ChatGPT 
7 Took some time to follow all ChatGPT steps and finally realized I did not install the Microsoft SQL Server Native Client Did that and now I am in

Just curious though I know I did some silly things while setting this up however isnt this too complicated I am only familiar with Postgre SQL and that was so easy to get it running locally and I believe it runs all SQL native functions and code while MySQL has some query limitations Correct me if I am wrong",0

qfyynHBFOsM,,0
qfyynHBFOsM,when downloading the dataset Im getting only few columns can anybody help,0
qfyynHBFOsM,I dont think it is so important for most people but I used Dbeaver for SQL and I could not import that whole dataset for Covid Deaths I had to clean the entire dataset with python first and then was able to use it on Dbeaver It was also much easier  then writing the code for only countries and no continents for each thing we had to execute There is another Video on Data Cleaning with Python I love it soooo muchhh,1
qfyynHBFOsM,Honestly not wanna waste anyones time But this video is time consuming its better to do 100 sql queries better then wasting time in this video I am not cretisizing but this is honest review I almost took 4 days to do this becasue I was a beginner and I took and understood each and every step from chatgpt so this course project was waste of time It was not point to point story telling thing He is a great person and his contents are good but in this video  reputation fell down Recommending everyone whoever watches comments please do 100 sql codes rather then wasting time watching this video,1
qfyynHBFOsM,You might be good but in sql video you have explained few things unnecessarily and its very confusing to learn Honestly I got frustrated because I was always going to chatgpt to learn about your concepts Please if you are doing any projects then explain each and every step without any extra information that is not required We follow you and learning from your content but this took a lot of time and I learned 10 of this video,0

qfyynHBFOsM,It took me one day to import the xlsx file to the database my device is mac and I am using azure data studio but it does not support xlsx files and I changed the format of files to csv still it has error,0
qfyynHBFOsM,why does it saves on wrong format on mine theres only 3 rows,-1
qfyynHBFOsM,Hello everyone please select Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server as the destination source it works fine thanks,1
qfyynHBFOsM,"So if you are having problems importing the files at the beginning do this maybe the words wont be the exact same because my pc is in italian
 in the excel file check the data format it must be mmddyy this is very important
 then save the excel file as csv
go to SSMS right click on the database  tasks  import data  next  source data flat file source  then chose the csv file change the file extension during the file selection and change local setting in English United States very important next  next again  the destination is the last one Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server  next  next  finish  and finish again",1
qfyynHBFOsM,Dear all I am currently working on this project on the 28th of january 2024 I am stuck at importing the data in SSMS and got a notification from the export and import wizard  merge and subtitle instead of proceeding to selecting the data source option Can anyone tell me what to do Asked Deepseek and Chatgpt and googled my ass of on finding the correct thing to do I already installed it and reinstalled it and still gives me errors Help is much appreciated Thanks in advance,1
qfyynHBFOsM,10528 this query is wrong because if you see the percentage vaccinated for Gibraltar it will show 18211 which means totalvaccinated is more than population which means newVaccination column count is wrong instead use maxpeoplefullyvaccinated to find count of vaccinated individuals per country and maxpeoplefullyvaccinated population for percenatagevaccinated,-1

qfyynHBFOsM,Hey all heres how to acces the data at 253 look at the top left corner of the graph click the link then scroll down to the red button to download the full data as csv,1
qfyynHBFOsM,I am not able to download the dataset is the link correct,-1
qfyynHBFOsM,If you are having issues  trying to import to mySQL Workbench  Save file as CSV then use Visual Studio Code to change the encoding to UTF8 without BOM You will be able to do this using the bottomright corner of your VS Code window If it says UTF with Bom change this to UTF8 by clicking it then click save with encoding then UTF8 then save file I also used VSCode to find and replace blank cells with NULL Hope this helps anyone who has had the same issue as me,1
qfyynHBFOsM,"Doing this is in January 2025 The WHERE clause on 3514 did not work for me so I used
WHERE continent   

This is similar to IS NOT NULL but in this case the data has probably been deleted manually so in that case we use this way Hope that helps",0

m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thank you for the course,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I really appreciate your work but I love to learn more under you as a student as I love to be certified,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Hes really quick,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Youre a remarkable tutor I cant believe it just took me 10 minutes to actually understand this perfectly,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This is just the right channel for SQL Hatts off man,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I see that in most cases you can use a join instead of a subquery Which cases are better for each method,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This interface makes me mad,-1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I stumbled across this video seeking additional help as I am currently on a subquery section in a data analyst course from Udemy and I found it to be very helpful I was planning on finishing the course then starting the Google Data Analyst Certification from Coursera what are your thoughts on it  Ive heard mixed reviews,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This performance gave me goosebumps Incredible talent,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I actually got really good at CTEs first then Temp tables and last was subqueries Apparently thats backwards lol My struggle is knowing when to use each one Ive written queries using all 3 for one reason or another most of the time it just depends on how i feel that day as i havent noticed any differences in the run time or results,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,let me subscribe to your channel real quick,1

m1KcNV-Zhmc,This is a great video about subquery Thank you Alex,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,do you have any suggestions on where I could practice these functions more and this playlist is really beneficial thanks for the time and effort,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,what is the tool you using,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I find the comments ridiculous
These kind of subqueries are things you learn after 1 week of work on a sql dwhIs Just basic basic basic stuff",0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"great content
had a bit of difficulty sticking it out because of all the vocal fry No offense intended
I would like to suggest doing some vocal warmup exercises to make it more aurally pleasing but Im also an idiot so dont take what Im saying too seriously",0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Thank you for sharing really really appreciate this I would love to see more advanced stuff specifically examples where youre using synonyms across different servers within source stored procedures used to populate stage tables to make joins along with ctes I am at an internship right now and still in my first year of college I feel completely lost when working in these health insurance databases most videos on youtube dont really go into more complicated stuff that I work with everyday so thank you again

Many of these queries in the code base are 3000 lines long and my brain goes numb looking at all the subqueries joins and obscure functions I have no idea what they do",1

m1KcNV-Zhmc,Very helpful Than you,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hi I just tried the syntax for subquery in where but I tried it also using join and got exact result

Alex subquery in Where
select EmployeeID JobTitle Salary
from EmployeeSalary
where EmployeeID in 
	select EmployeeID
	from EmployeeDemographics
	where Age  30


my syntax
select demoEmployeeID JobTitle Salary
from EmployeeDemographics as demo
join EmployeeSalary as sal
	on demoEmployeeID  salEmployeeID
where Age  30

Anyway I find your tutorial very informative and tried to use some work arounds if they will have the same output Thank you always Alex",1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Done for SQL Tutorial after 3 weeks of learning and spending 23 hours in each session while creating different scenarios outside the samples hehe Mygee I made it haha Thank you Alex Next step is to get a certificate of SQL before proceeding to the other Tools Hopefully Im doing it right Lol,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I am Finally done with SQL on this amazing channel But got to go back for some revisions,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,As someone who received SQL training during masters degree I have to say that I learned much more from Alexs SQL lessons than what I learned at school You are amazing Alex,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This wasnt bad but do you anything other than really quick You said it 21 times in 830,-1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How many times can someone say really quickwow good stuff tho,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How tf you set an alias for a subquery as a,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I just finished the Beginner Intermediate and Advanced SQL videos Thank you Alex for publishing these Im adding SQL to my tool belt These were a fantastic first look at the language,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Slowing down your pace a bit would help the absolute zero beginner,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This looks like a really interesting subject I didnt know anything about it until now but I suspect the exponential geometric and weibull distributions might factor in,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Brilliant SQL Tutorial Series Every Video has really helped to fill in any potential gaps in my knowledge and even reinforce my existing skills Thanks Alex,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Just to clarify only the where statement combined with the subquery can only have 1 column selected SELECT and FROM can select all columns if wanted from a subquery thanks,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Should have started watching you long ago,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Where is primary and foreign key video could you please share the link,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Mr Alex  Im currently following your steps on tge sql project  but it shows me operand divide And it is giving me errors  Please someone show help me out,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I have enjoyed your videos I have been programming and working as a dba for a long time 28 years  since sql server 42 Do you remember  I would consider myself an expert in sql server I was even able to pick up a couple things in your sql videos that I didnt know or at least did 8n a different way Great job Looking forward to the python and newer content Working towards learning how to use ML to help clean data and find errors over the next year,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Excellent Tutorial,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Instead of doing WHERE EmployeeID IN SELECT EmployeeId FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE Age  30 you could do WHERE EXISTS SELECT EmployeeId FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE Age  30 AND EmployeeDemographicsEmployeeId  EmployeeSalaryEmployeeId No Which one is more efficient,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,that was really quick,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Ill stop here at DAY4,-1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Still confusing AF but I think I will get there at some point  Thanks,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I just finished the SQL tutorial from beginner to advanced Now I want to start the portofolio project but part 2  4 of that video are missing Let me know when those video already uploaded thank you very much and sorry if theres something wrong about this comment Im still learning English,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Where this may be good for beginners I was hoping for some actual advanced queries These were sort of common sense basic IMO Where I work they have some COMPLEX subqueries and I was hoping to get something even remotely similar But im just not the target audience for this video obviously,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How do you do this on MySQL or MariaDB,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Hey Alex All your videos on Sql Tutorials are awesome Can you make a video on how to use primary and foreign keys in Sql Server Youve mentioned in one of your videos that youll be covering those topics but I havent come across the PK and FK in the Sql Tutorialsmaybe Ive missed them Or if you have a video already out could you direct me to it Thanks for all the videos theyve helped me understand SQL Server much better,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thank you so much Alex Your videos are superb,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I thought I knew SQL but this whole series of videos help me understand that I dont know anything Although your explanation was ease to follow and understand I feel that need more study to really understand all the conceptsThanks a lot for your time to make this series,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thanks it was helpful,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,question im confused why does GROUP BY not work when writing subqueries i didnt quite understand,-1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Holy mackerel We think and code exactly the sameThis is exactly how I teach people about subqueries and partition by and even the rarely used right join which is similar to not in where clause subquery,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thanks Alex,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How about doing an AVG SALARY for each employee instead of AVG FOR ALL How do you query that,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Hi Alex Im following you in LinkedIn Pls keep me post it about the data analyst bootcamp you plan to launch I myself I am changing career I want to be more technical marketer with strong focus on web analytics and touching here and there analytics subjects,1

m1KcNV-Zhmc,Great content Thanks,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Ive just finished this series 1 week Im going to rewatch it all again hopefully 1 day and then start the Portfolio Project I started from 0 and your videos are purely useful content it made me understand SQL really fast 
Thanks from Spain 
PD I will communicate here when I finish the course completly and also if I am lucky enough to get a job",1

m1KcNV-Zhmc,"On my journey through the boot camp

This comes in handy Thank you",1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Im so grateful for the SQL tutorial video Thank you for sharing your knowledge,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Can anyone please help me understand Why is there a FROM operator in both the outer query and the subquery  

Hi I love the way you explain things  People have very different ways of explaining programmingcoding concepts and your ways of seeing things really works well for me  

SELECT EMPLOYEEID SALARY SELECT AVGSALARY FROM EMPLOYEESALARY
              FROM EMPLOYEESALARY 

What does the FROM operator do in the outer query that it doesnt do in the inner query",1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,King you are the best sql teacher on youtube Thanks SO much for making content on sql concepts that are actually used in everyday work flows,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hello Alex
I love ur videos they v been guiding me through data analysis but i v issues with my sql",1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,There is a missing pieces that is preventing me from cracking this thing i just cant figure out what it is,-1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Subquery can also alternatively be replaced by temp table or CTE,0
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Bad example on partition by but everyone on YT copies one another and gives nonrealistic examples For anyone reading for people who actually work with  SQL Partition by in a Nested join subquery will give you a count when grouping by something different or you can use it in the outer For example 5 nested tables 1 primary table nested from table The partition by in the outer you can cntd partition by xyz fields to produce a value For example lets say you are running daily dates and want a count distinct by accounts etc You will 100 not get the right count Why your nested quries are pushing out numbers by day fine with sums Not fine with counts count distincts Essentially you are counting distinct daily and it must be dealt with inside nested query  out or in the outer These things are what should be covered However instead you get people who id suspect dont know anything about SQL and downloaded some videos and copied it over to their own version Anyone rushing over partition by trust me close their video Its massively powerful and in all honesty one of the most important functions along with LAGLEAD that you can possibly grasp Especially aggregating updown across multiple timeframes Once again real job vs playing around pressing play for kids on youtube,1
m1KcNV-Zhmc,SubQueries I keep coming back here,0

IZRe0nwkuXc,Thank you so much for these videos I relate to your career story so much I was wondering about what a data analyst role can be in the clinical setting I am a former respiratory therapist and professor of biology and I really want to analyze clinicalpatient data Not as interested in insurance analysis Do you know much about how data analysts are used for clinical data if at all,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,It was very refreshing to hear that a data Analyst not necessarily needs to become a data scientist I share the same feeling more towards data engineering and with this video I have realized that I am not crazy for thinking about it hahaha,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,I am currently a data analyst in a data science department Personally I enjoy putting data together to tell a story more than building predictive models Ive never felt the need to jump into being an official data scientist,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex thank you for your videos they are super helpful
Im not sure where to ask questions I watched a video today on an intro to stats and near the end of the video he talked about pvalue hacking Do you know about this I am trying to get into data analysis and am wondering if this sort of stats stuff relates to data analysis roles at all
Thank you again",0
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Do I need to learn python indepth or python for data analysis

PS Coding haunts me",0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex Like your videos The way you present yourself and your thoughts is really appreciable Last year I was thinking of transitioning my career from an engineer to become a Data analyst Your videos helped me a lot Your videos also helped me to choose the right courses and skills And now I  have all the right skillset to become a data analyst Thanks,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Im more fascinated by data engineering too  The thing most data scientists hate about their job is data cleansing but thats one of my favorite aspects of being a data analyst,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Watched this video as I sit in the middle of no where Ohio,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,This is really the most authentic QA video Iv ever watched love your content and wishing you the best of luck on your new role,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Thanks Alex I like how honest you are when answering questions about career and goals,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,really am not so good at programming and i would like to study data science or data analyst can i pursue it,-1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Thanks for the information,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,if only i had a teacher like you in my school tysm alex,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,New subscriber here Great channel Im a recovering digital advertiser transitioning into becoming a data analyst Looking forward to diving through the SQL videos that youve made D,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,You said you regret not having done computer science but you can learn in your free time right,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Amen about doing Python first of course that is the ML mindset,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex
This was a really great video
can you make a video about
How much math do you really need to know to be a data analyst",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Great video alex
Thank u so much 
I have found ur channel and its a big boost for me to link my medical background  I am a pharmacist working for 3 years now  with data analysis which I really like cuz the combination of these two set a lot of potentials imo in medical field
Currently I am working in data analytics certificate in the second course and at same time I am working in Udacity course  there are 3 tracks I am in the Challenger track  next one is professional and advanced 
Which one u think I should put all my time and effort  Google or Udacity cuz feel I am distracted between both switching back and forth 
Hope u can give ur insights I would really appreciate it
Best greetings from Egypt",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hey Alex
Thanks for answering my previous question
Do you need to make any notes or revise in order to complete the google data analytics at a high level or are you just required to watch the videos and do the questions in order to complete the course and gain the certificate
Thanks",0
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex I hope you ar doing well Do you think that being 30 years old with no experience apart from excel is a huge liability if I want to start learning data analyst skills and potentially look for a job as one

Keep up the amazing channel",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,I dont have any questions for you I just wanted to say you are doing a great job,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hi Alex I see Business Intelligence Engineer and Data Engineer start to become more popular these days Do you think companies are starting to classified Business Intelligence Engineer as a distinct role than general Data Analyst Will there be a future for this role,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Math was never my strong point Do you feel there is a deep need for it as a deep level to succeed as as analyst,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Heyi just got an internship as a data analyst in a startup thanks to you too but now the problem is how do I progress as a data analyst could you share some resources to get more insights and better understanding on data,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hey Alex bit of a longer question here with some background information if you have the time

So I am a PhD student in a social science field that stresses quantitative research Essentially what this means for me is that we utilize software such as R and STATA heavily deal with large data setsmerging numerous data sets together running various regression models interpreting regression outputs and running diagnostics on these regressions and engaging in data transformation to resolve any errors in the regression models Along with data visualization of descriptive statistics and regression outputs


With all of that being said my excursions on job hunting websites have led me to so many data analyst positions where it appears that none of the things I practice in academia are advertised as required skills in these respective data analyst positions Am I simply looking for the wrong type of job Do different types of data analysts do different things Is there a uniform set of skills as opposed to programs you need to know such as SQL being a must that practically all data analysts are required to know",0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Would you be able to talk about what I can do to get from mid level analyst to senior level Or is it purely on experience,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Please do a video on projects that can help a person stand out in an entry level role Also take us through all the steps so that we can have a idea on how to do our own projects,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,1749 Its awesome how youre crystal clear on your passion Great video Alex,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Is it possible to become a Data analyst and also a Data engineer Like having equal experience on both and decide to analyze and also do the engineering work,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,The thing is that data analyst and data scientist are very different things I was a data scientist for 3 years our department got consolidated and I was let go Due to extremely high work requirements for a data scientist I actually was looking at a data analyst role and quickly learned that I have never built KPIs SSRS reports and very basic forecasting In one of my interviews I was given a task to do some simple EDA on a medical dataset When I was done with the task I actually built a pretty solid XGboost  Classification Models in Python I know python R MATLAB SQL and have written my own packages cleanup functions  including the requested data cleanup EDA In presenting my findings the manager and her team were more confused with my analysis than anything else Needless to say I learned that you cant go from data scientist to data analyst Recently I got hired back as a data scientist with a different company,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Thank you for the transparency As far as data science goes do you think the field is getting hard to break into Will the field eventually close And if so when,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex when you say  if you have 2 years experience of Data Analyst you should know a lot I think in depends where you did it for example I started my 2 first experiences working with SAS Software It was not SQL I needed after to learn sql python etc

One other stuff I have a computer science degree and sometimes I think It was not necessary to do 5 years to do this job because It was a lot of Math but really who really cares in Company Its better to be good in programmation and communication to do this job",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Big big big thanks for this video
And really looking for your SQl videos and portfolio video
I was just looking to get started in Data Analyst role and help for it and you really are helping me a lot
Hope so I get into my passion",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,You mentioned that you would like to move into a data engineer role can a data analyst move into a data engineer role,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Im new here and found so much related to my career I wanna be into data analytics and i have to start my learning Your content has clear my path and has given me such valuable guidance Thank you Your channel is the most clear search i gave gone through till now,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,heyy Alex Is front end engineering has more number of job opportunities that Data analyticsengineering,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Ive been 3 years into my Journey using mainly tableau Ive been spoiled by solution architects writing SQL that i visualize Think its time to learn more SQL,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Got SQL a bit beyond basic select snd joins Tableau and Excel covered Excel actually pretty well as I ve worked with it for a year Now the hardest part is getting a job Literally all jobs Im seeing out there ask for at least two years of experience This is the hardest part to deal with 
I d like to see a video about legit job requirements I think I ve seen the one maybe two about resumes and the one about totally unrealistic job requirements but I think I d appreciate more detailed content in this direction I got laid off last year when the pandemic hit so I no longer have the option of transitioning but have to actually start from zero 
Getting the skills is half of the task the other half being applying them and I find this part much more challenging
But great work so far I really appreciate your content",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Really looking forward to your SQL portfolio video I searched high and low and I literally couldnt find anything,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Really good video Quick question though but if you could give a percentage or break down of what data analyst skills you use day to day what would it be,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Is statistics obligatory to become a data analyst,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex I regret to not have asked this question in AMA What job role and salary one can expect if one has 2 years of experience in operations and post that a MBA in data analytics concentration Will he still be considered a fresher,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hes not a data scientist because I have monopolized all the data science,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey there I really appreciate the videos you are putting out You have helped me a lot in overcoming questioning my own capabilities for a data scientist role I just recently was accepted into a masters program for data science and you have played a large part in helping me get there I just wanted to relay a sincere thankyou from a fellow Texan and future data analyst,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Ohio  yeah you are  right we dont get pay that much lol  I have compared my salary with other states and we dont make that much  what do you think about micro masters from MIT and Harvard,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hi Alex I really appreciate your channel Im wondering if your estimate of entrylevel data analyst salaries is a little too low The information for the Google data analytics certificate lists 67900  as the average entrylevel salary Do you think thats unrealistic Maybe that average is skewed with all the jobs in Silicon Valley Thanks for any input,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Timestamps for questions please Thanks,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Great video I really liked that you shared your thoughts on why you prefer data analyst work over data science work Keep doing what makes you happy Anyways this has motivated me to start my final project in my data analysis course haha,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Heck yeah thank you for answering my question Alex   Im always curious on what others in our field are planning next in their careers  Im also a little unsure as well on where I want to go next so it was refreshing to hear that others are encompassing the same thoughts and issues when planning for the future  Keep up the content

PS Regarding my first question Python vs R IMHO I would have installed Pandas first ha",0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Do you think data analyst job will be automated with AI,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,This was great Thanks Alex,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Im taking a data science specialization rn currently going through statistical inference How important is that in terms of data analytics which is what I think I would like to land a job in Also if I already have a decent base in r retrieving cleaning and graphing data how important is it to still learn sql,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hipls do full project video on sqlplzzz,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,As a current data analyst health informatics analyst living in Ohio but working remotely out of Michigan I can tell you that Alex is correct Recently had an offer for a data analyst role and the hourly rate was less than 1800,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Im  recent college graduate with realistically about a year or so experience I mean I have been in my Co op role for almost 3 years In my internship supporting a fortune 500 company IT dept Very experienced in excel comfortable with SQL learning python And I feel like Im illequipped Struggling finding a job I feel like I have fundamental knowledge of alot of things like data mining machine learning nosql data structure big data etc But Im no expert at none of these Any advice or tips,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Im just working on my BA thesis your videos motivate me since youre so passionate about it,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Thanks Alex for a great video Ive been sort of slowly working towards Data Science However the more I look into the field the more I see Im probably better suited for a Data Analysis role A good part of the reason for my change has been your very informative videos so thank you Yes DA is the sexy cool job everyone is pushing but damnthe MATH  MY GOD THE MATH LOL You might as well just add a dual Statistics major along with anything else youre studying That and making data models doesnt seem that interesting 

Watching your videos along with Ken Jee and Jens Career Force videos has really helped me refine what I should be working towards Thanks again",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,If you just jump right into Python you can get really lost  yep been there,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Wicked I love your channel man good to hear an honest opinion about degrees and that you dont just give any old bull about no regrets and just follow your passion youre open about thinking you couldve done better with a different education Fair enough I know the feeling D Am looking forward to the portfolio video Peace from UK,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Great answers Alex thank you,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,You didnt mention Information Systems as a good major so Ill give my experience I just graduated studying it and learned R Python SQL and an array of database management skills I think for an analyst it is better than CS If you want to be a dev or data scientist then CS is much better Hope this helps clarify to anyone deciding between majors,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Appreciate the last answer Alex We need more exposure for this other perspective Theres way too much narrative about data analyst as a means to an end Its almost just assumed that of course everybody wants to be a data scientist Nah,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hello Alex Great video I had some questions as well wanted to clarify some thing
1 Do you recommend learning TSQL or PLSQL as well 
2 What type of datasets to use for a project as a beginner From a simple dataset to a more intermediate level
3 How to make sense of data to spot trends facts relationship between them and make inferences It would be great if you can do a project series
4 Ive been toying with the idea of freelancing So if I get a project how do I go about asking client the questions Like what are they looking for or just how do I communicate with them I have no work experience and honestly this part terrifies me a bit 
5 Suppose a project is at its end we have made a reportdashboard What comes after this How to convey to the client what insights we have made",1
IZRe0nwkuXc,In the Google Certificate Ive learned that being a Data Analyst could be a stepping stone to being a Data Engineer as well Do you ever get asked about that career path If so is it more geared towards programming Or does it require the necessary math skills like being a Data Scientist Thanks,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,I really appreciate the fact that your answers and reaction to the questions were quite honest and real I enjoyed and learned a lot while watching this Q  A Thanks a lot and keep doing it,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex I hope you are doing well I am in Business Management Major Planning to transition to Data Analytics Can you give me some tips on what to learn first for Data Analytics And any other advisr you can give Thank you,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Your videos motivate me to work towards my goal Thankyou Alex,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Great Video I have a degree in Mathematics Is Data  Analytics suited for me,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,One thing I havent figured out is the best way to find data sets to use for practical practice or portfolio projects Any tips,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Im very excited for the project videos I think it would be to see a professional run through some examples and use the full technology stack,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,This is going to be pretty laidback Awesome Because I hate all your stodgy buttonedup videos Take the tuxedo off and relax man,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Data analyst remote work,0
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex Big fan Awesome video How does the Google data analytics certification compare with the data analytics or data science track on datacamp Thanks,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,If you would please answer my question which is I have been working as a customer service industry and really I got upset of it recently Im studying data analysis from udicty platform my degree is accounting but I dont like numbers at all however as far I went through the course I found myself adapted with numeric stuff so I wanted to know when Im getting deeper into it would it requires me to do more complex mathematics thing or it is more about mining data and visualize it,1
IZRe0nwkuXc,Bro when are you going to upload the whole series of the SQL videos Im looking forward to it,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,In Google Advanced Data Analytics Certifications  Python  Statistics ML  Data Science etc is Taught,1

9RRQtNnq3s0,Im halfway through my IBM Data Analytics and I love it,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Thanks for the comparison There are lots of these reviewscomparison videos but no one really addresses what seems to me a pretty big detail as someone who is yet to take either course and that is job type that the course states that it is designed to set up its students for 
IBM Data Scientist CA102745 median entrylevel salary for Data Scientist
Google Data Analyst CA76837 median entrylevel salary for Data Analyst

Why is there this big difference",1
9RRQtNnq3s0,IBM is still better,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,GOOGLE TEAM,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I loved Sally too,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,I took the Google course when it first came out and did not like it I hope theyve improved it since then I did not like any of the instructors It was too much fluff and not enough intheweeds info about the technical skills I felt like it barely scratched the surface of SQL and R and the concepts they did review were poorly explained The job consortium and employment help did not lead to a job and a LinkedIn group for others taking the course confirmed I wasnt the only one who wasnt helped by these resources Unless its now much different and has had a major revamp I would not recommend it,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hey Alexand strangers willing to help I wanted to know if I could still get a job with the help of Google if I am not American or living in the US I know this video is old and I really do not know much about anything right now but this would be really helpful Thank you in advance,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,The people that teach you the lessons on the Google cert are just reading it it feels unnatural I prefer the IBM style where animations are presented while the content is read much easier to focus,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hey Alex now that its been over 3 years Would you say that your opinions have changed or the courses havent changed much to warrant it

Id love to see an update video",1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Found this video today Its great to hear about the differences between the IBM and Google Data Analytics Certification offerings I am planning to enrol into your Data Analytics Bootcamp and go for certifications for some of the technologies eg PowerBI Python etc If Im already embarking on this route do I still need Googles certificate Will it add value to what Ill be getting from Microsoft Python Institute etc,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Where can I learn python while taking the Google course,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I started the IBM one bc I figured google would focus on google sheets when excel is the business norm but I know what ya mean with the more personal touch google has when I took the digital marketing certification,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thumbs up to Sally  Hopefully Sally  his wife are still friends,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Too many bots in the comments,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Sally me ganhou kk,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Thank you for this Excellent video

Please I have a question 

Is it possible to certify a whole analytic Agency  an entreprise which proposes mainly services of data analysis in order to be more credible

If yes how",1
9RRQtNnq3s0,I just signed up for the course and Im excited to meet Sally,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Would you say using google sheets will conflict with your usage of Excel or are they similair in way,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hi thanks this video is helpfulcan you please share the link to the channel by Sally,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,hello Sir first of all thanks for providing this content I had one question if I purchase One course for 1 month and not completed within it does my course expireor does it asks for another Payment,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,This is super helpful because ive been comparing the two trying to spot the differences Also with IBM were there any concerns with language barriers Ik for me when learning i struggled in statistics when the instructor spoke a different language,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thank you Alex  i discovered you from LinkedIn now am hooked to your channel as someone trying to switch to Data analyst am learning alot,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,After getting enrolled in any course and successfully completing it will I need to pay extra money for the certificate,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,What Python course do you recommend,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hey Alex I am completely new in this field and was looking for something like this I aspire to be a Data Analyst but in my previous attempts I have failed twice I think again Ill opt for it as I dont want to give up and maybe this time I might actually make it I have learned about the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate recently and its looking right for me Do you have any thoughts,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I tried both I finished Google because it was much better structured Also the IBM courses range between great quality at a high level of understanding to unclear and irrelevant questions with countless numbers of grammatical mistakes Many of IBMs voiceovers are likely AIgenerated I think too,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,R is going extinct,-1
9RRQtNnq3s0,I prefer IBM simple and straightforward,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Totally agree with you on the Google style vs IBM,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I already have my Google Data Analytics Certificate Would it be better to get the Advanced Google Data Analytis Certificate or the IBM Data Analytics Certificate,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,What about google it support vs ibm support,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,well hope your wife didnt see this video yet,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I am an absolute beginner Can you please recommend to me which Python course should I take along with the Google Data Analyst Certification course I do not have any basic knowledge of Python either,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,point my curiosity is now well fed I am enrolling Google Data Analytics as well as PYTHON programming on a different platform Please what platform do you recommend for python,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hi I am a freshman at college majoring in Economics learning statistics and Econometrics I hope to sharpen my skills before I look for internship So Data analysis is on my mind Which certificate is more suitable for me Thanks,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,i dont like that google instructors look talk and move like bots i also think IBM course teaches better programs,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Sally is really great in that Google module,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks a lot Alex Just completed Google Data Analytics certificate and now enrolled in Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate Love from Pakistan,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,both are useless if youre seeking a data analyst job without a Math of Computer science degrees it worked of few people ONLY in the US and Canada while its as good as a toilet paper everywhere else however if youre a college student and want an introduction into the field well it may give you some tips,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,answer is both,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I would say do both  I learned R and Python in college and they both good usage to it Man once i am done with python i wanna try Google Analytics Thanks for the recommendation,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Have you herd about the new product of microsoft fabric It is more and more interesting AI is now digging into data analytics world,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Please drop the link for both courses Thank you,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Google,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Really helpful video Thank you,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,I got both and neither of them got me any job so,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Awesome You make things really easy for beginners I really appreciate it,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hello Alex  I would like to know if there is a difference between data analysis and data science  if yes which professional certificate would you recommend,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Honestly I have no idea why watching someone talk to you is better than listening to someone with actual slides on the subjectI get tired of fun talk training on serious subjectsthats a problem actually,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks Alex For your valuable recommendation,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,so guys did actually anybody a job after finishing the course,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks Been thinking about this for weeks,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,"This video helps me a lot Im just in that situation meaning wich data analyst program should I take and I think that after this video I definitely will go for the Google data analyst program Thanks for made life easier 
Btw I also prefer someone explaining yourself over a ppt slide or whatever that was 
Best",1
9RRQtNnq3s0,If youre paying for Coursera plus it becomes a question whether or not you should grab both of them,0

9RRQtNnq3s0,I am on Sallys course now and I love her very much,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Can I land the job where I will get paid nothing But at least learn,-1

9RRQtNnq3s0,I wonder if Alexs wife is worried about Sally,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Nice video but you omitted a huge deciding factor for most people  cost,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hi Alex Thanks for this video  I was doing the Google Python cert but I will also add this cert as well  Cheers,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Ive spent about a day or two manually comparing both courses to find a winner Thank you Alex youve made my endless search come to an end with this video I think its worth mentioning that IBMs had the ACE recommended feature for people looking to earn up to 12 college credits

I recently chose to start a career in Data ScienceAnalysis over Product Design and this will be my first course to actualize that dreamgoaltarget 

Wish me luck",0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Good info  I just started course 3 in the Google data analytics I subbed,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hi Alex can managers take this Google DnA Certificate Or only meant for beginners,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Google uses google spreadsheets and ibm uses excel does this make a difference,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,Do you still recommend Google certification or something else,0
9RRQtNnq3s0,I got them both but I felt IBM certification is more professional IBM courses include some model building model evaluation and some other deep knowledge about data analyzing,1

9RRQtNnq3s0,Sally doesnt know you You are just a pervert haha,1
9RRQtNnq3s0,please do google provide the means to download all the tools you need after registration Or you need to have the apps installed before you register A response will highly be appreciated,1

qewHAdfzLOw,Question do they pay you well,0

But I chose the wrong degree 
And now I have a bachelors in mathematics 
I am so lost rn",1
qewHAdfzLOw,are their r communities on R such as,0
qewHAdfzLOw,My last company gave us subscriptions to Coursera we had to apply I was able to learn how to code through it which helped me in my then job My current company gives each manager a training budget so I could take courses as long as they make sense for my jobjob prospects within the company,1
qewHAdfzLOw,He said learn on employers time not dime Actually employers love to pay for certificates they will probably not pay for a degree even if you could attend in the evenings,1
qewHAdfzLOw,He s right a typical data analyst will have a business degree and experience in less technical and more businessfinance areas,0
qewHAdfzLOw,Hey Alex very informative video Im interested in data science and am currently choosing between online DS master degrees in Australia coming from a bachelor degree in agribusiness One is a year longer to complete but seems very thorough The other is a bit light on for stats and python but is shorter and cheaper I could use the extra timemoney to learn more advanced statsget online certswork on GitHub projects If Im willing to put in the effort in my own time do you think a weaker degree is likely to prove a drawback Im imagining I would start out in analytics either way,1
qewHAdfzLOw,Love it,1
qewHAdfzLOw,I love that Ken is wearing a houseplant hat throughout the video Thats a nice juxtaposition of foreground and background in Alexs frame And actually more visually pleasing than Kens weird offtopic clips within his own video,1
qewHAdfzLOw,Hey Alex I love your video Can I connect with you on LinkedIn Im a cs junior at UIUC and I am currently exploring both data analyst and scientists roles If you are convenient It would be great If I can occasionally ask you a few short questions,1
qewHAdfzLOw,Hi I didnt know that employers dont invest on their resource knowledge leverage or fund them to reskill that is not the case where I work so that amaze me I cant tell where is it or their social media studio robot will pop the alarm and will look at my other comments as well but if you want to get a certificate is very common to get a voucher and time and if you fail one time they also cover it so is good to know Im in a good place to start my career shift Thanks for your videos,0
qewHAdfzLOw,I disagree with employers not paying If u are at a fortune 500 Ive found this is the norm My first company paid for my entire masters,1
qewHAdfzLOw,The legendary nerd beef xD,1
qewHAdfzLOw,Hi Alex your video tutorials are pretty much awesome I want to you personal chat regarding data analyst career Can you share your email please,1
qewHAdfzLOw,"Its jarring as a new viewer to hear you harp so much on jobs not paying to upskill their employees as I just watched one of your videos yesterday highlighting tuition reimbursement as a benefit to keep an eye out for when applying

If youre going to position yourself as above drama then be above it You dont actually get points for claiming to be above drama and having no issues with someone when you actively engage in with what you believe to be drama and spend a whole video being passive aggressive

This contention definitely feels like a thinly veiled attempt at driving engagement Which is kind of sad but on brand for 2021 influencer culture 

It was just weird to hear you say you love this guy like a brother and have no issue with him and then in the very next breath say that he stole a video topic that you had not yet published  with a straight face It was surprisingly accurate foreshadowing of the next eleven and a half minutes of judging his tabs his video editing and his pull ups

Not sure if yall see the Google Certificate as something that will significantly expand your niches viewership and are now trying to claim the biggest share of new viewers but if so I guarantee you aggy videos like this arent going to keep viewers coming back Fix it",0

My option 1  Lenovo ideapad slim 5 Amd Ryzen 7 16gb ram 512ssd

Option 2  MSI Modern 14 Intel Core i5 16ram 512ssd or MSI Thin Intel Core i5 16ram 1tb ssd

Option 3  Asus Vivobook Pro 14x Ryzen 7 16gb ram 512ssd or Asus Vivobook S15 Intel Core i7 16gb ram 512ssd

I also considering the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5 which is Convertible It has Ryzen 7 16gb of ram and 512ssd honestly i really like the design also Amd is much cheaper than Intel But is it enough to use for learning Data Analyst Enlighten me please",0

bHssBHfHWmU,,0
bHssBHfHWmU,Greetings Alex First off I want to say how much your vids have helped me throughout my carrier path and I appreciate what you do So the reason Im writing you this is to get your professional advice Im a student of Data analytics and I just finished the course and Im currently on the verge to start on the coaching process They are recommending that I use 16 Ram and what I have is 8 Ram Can I work with it on the long run And also I brought a new laptop that had windows 11 but wasnt compatible because it works only with windows 10 Any opinion,0
bHssBHfHWmU,Im 42 a total noob looking to selflearn IT with a focus on hacking ARM and Networks My budget is 200 firm What phone laptop OS and language would you recommend,0
bHssBHfHWmU,An SSD is great for speed but they are just a big flash drive that has a life span determined but the quantity of read  writes so its better to have an conventional HDD for long term backup You can get free software to monitor how much life an SD has before failure For a laptop an external HDD to back up to works well for my While in my desktop I have both with storage for things not used daily and a partition for scheduled backup of the main SSD,1
bHssBHfHWmU,"I would like to add that you shouldnt suggest laptop which have an U in the processor series The reason stand that the U is an indicator that CPU has been drafted for users Customer so its not professional because the performance its peaked for the target  normal users peoples
If you have to work do not buy a laptop with U letter in cpu",0
bHssBHfHWmU,i am now looking for laptop to start learning about data analyst and its confusing this video helps me thanks,0
bHssBHfHWmU,Why am I told by the professor to get a MacBook Pro I prefer windows but they seemed to be leading me towards that Also does anyone have a courseboot camp they recommend,0
bHssBHfHWmU,Do you have any update for this video  or this video still relevant for 2023,1
bHssBHfHWmU,"Is this video still relevant for 2023  Do you have any update video

I am usually use power bi sql dan python for work do you have any laptop recomendations in 2023  

Hopefully you can answer Thanknyou",0
bHssBHfHWmU,What about graphics,0
bHssBHfHWmU,You forgot to mention that a ryzen processor is about 70 faster on  excel than an Intel of similar range,0
bHssBHfHWmU,Because I use my laptop to run VMWAre Workstation Pro to run CiscoCML and my data science apps  I need 128Gb of RAM as the base  Cisco CML uses a lot of RAM and CPU so I need a good 12th Gen CPU  I need a good NVidia card which is used to MLDL use cases  For install all the software i need at least 2 Gb of HDD storage  For these purposes I find these requirements cost about 5K right now  Yipes  But thats what my dual purpose DS Cisco CML EVENG sim cost,1
bHssBHfHWmU,"I have a Mac M1 16GB ram 
Ive been using windows for 15 years so it took a bit getting used to 

I love the build quality of MacBooks but i do miss windows I will say Windows glitches out and has more hiccups than MacOS But I miss the little features",1
bHssBHfHWmU,Might be a good time for an update for 2023  happy new year,1
bHssBHfHWmU,I only disagree with you on the importance of a full keyboard w a 10 key any DS should have easy access to the number keypad  I work mainly from home and I want to use this Envy 156 for a desktop monitor eventually  I have been wanting to stick w HP but my Envy has an issue with screen blackout at random times mostly when I have a split screen  But as it is almost 2023 I am going to check out the Omen to see if there are any configurations that I prefer  I am looking for 1T 16GB i7 or AMD Ryzan 7 17 screen size with a full keyboard  Any thoughts would be awesome Thank you as always Alex You rock,1
bHssBHfHWmU,Yhank you,0
bHssBHfHWmU,The amt of time u gave storage is wierd1 Tb hdd  plus 512 SSD should be good Analyst open several files at a time RAM plus high processor speed and no of core will make all the difference,1
bHssBHfHWmU,"One thing that I really like about reviews is follow up reviews of the product People cannot get a good reaction out of a product unless it has undergone a period of time in which its been put through its paces 

I would really appreciate a review of this product after the laptop has seen its 3rd anniversary of operation",1
bHssBHfHWmU,I like all your videos but this one missing very  important information The specs you mentioned are very generic and not accurate For example in RAMs other than GB it is important to be DR4 not the older types DDR 3 and Higher GB  in RAM and higher core i number in CPU DONT prove a better performance especially in CPU and RAM Thank you for sharing the videos Ive learned a lot especially the data analyst videos,1
bHssBHfHWmU,Hey Alex im a mac user for 15 years and been upskilling in data analysis in recent months and been using a mid tier windows which I have enjoyed with its compatibility many ports etc but the screen and battery life just dont compare to my mac How would you rate omens screen and battery life Thank you,1

And what next step after finih Andrew ng course",0
A4OVjWeVb10,"Im currently doing the Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization and let me say

If I wasnt doing my undergraduate in mathematics i would have a really hard time with this course 
Also having Python experience is definitely a prerequisite to the course It gets tough",-1
A4OVjWeVb10,Thanks for this Alex its all been added to my to learn list,1
A4OVjWeVb10,As much as I admire Andrew Ng his machine learning course uses Octave instead of Python which was the reason I decided not to take his course Its a bit outdated being 11 years old but Im sure the basics are still relevant,1
A4OVjWeVb10,Is the math course required Im in a masters program and the math is just so dry I want to code,0
A4OVjWeVb10,Dude did you really take all those classes Kudos to you man,1

SIseim20_Dc,"You and cauliflower are teaching me English vocab for vegetables quite well I had no idea what that is despite really liking it xD

Btw theres one other and very big thing that people often forget to take into account Machines glitch They glitch a lot No matter how good your IT department is

For example where I currently work as an intern we have a lot of standartised reports automated Analysts basically just need to prepare the data to fit a specific template and then the robots can prepare all the reports for us However with every new update to the report templates andor the robots there are inevitably a bunch of new bugs including robots preparing certain reports incorrectly or refusing to prepare them at all And sure sooner or later the tech guys are going to fix it until something new breaks at least but when push comes to shove and our deadlines are close which they constantly are it is up to the analysts to actually do everything by hand until the robots get fixed And thats why despite all the automatisation were still needed at the job",1

I am not understanding this can you please explain it if possible with a small example",-1
SIseim20_Dc,"So a question about the Automation of Data Analysis Edit And about the future of Data Analysis as a career in general 

Like I commented under another of your videos Im trying to find a different career path to get out of being an electrician Data Analysis really seem like it might be what I will be going for in the very near future My question now is considering the maybemaybe not automation of the job in the future do you think it would be worth it to get into the industry And do you think that in the future with automation ramping up the will be as good money wise as it is right now Im currently 24 and depending on how much money I make I plan to work until I am at least 60 The thing is that I dont know that much about the industry and want to prevent myself from entering a possible career path that wouldnt last me as long Granted if I work as a Data Analyst for such a long time I might find opportunities to branch of into a different direction but right now Im solely looking at the case of me doing the same job  going the same direction until I retire

SIseim20_Dc,Im thinking about my job and how complex the business is and Im not sure AI can fully replace what I do Our business has 1000s of tables with complex relationships that are very complex in nature Our orders table for example  has billions of records with information on taxing discounts products etc that all relate to other objects Im starting to think about all the views and tables we create for reporting needs and all the complex logic and SQL that goes into creating these views and I just dont see how that can be fully automated without a human being involved Can the AI and human work together Sure but the AI on its own doesnt sound like it can work After the data has been massaged and transformed there are so many ways to interpret the results that you couldnt possibly rely on just AI for that without human intervention I think the two will ultimately work together and nobody has to freak out about AI replacing any jobs,0
SIseim20_Dc,"I think people also confuse Automation with Artificial General intelligence which from my understanding are two very different things 

At a certain point if a large majority of jobs get automated and it puts a large amount of people out of work then who will be left to actually buy stuff

NrBJmtD0kEw,Oh my god thank you so much for just getting right to the point in your video  finally someone gets it,1
NrBJmtD0kEw,Remarkable how much content there is in here digestible and usable  Thanks,1
NrBJmtD0kEw,Why not simply use HeidiSQL,0
NrBJmtD0kEw,i really loved The Office names in DB hahahah,1
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I dont understand
Why would we want to use Stored Procedures over VIEWS or Functions",0
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I appreciate the work youve put into these tutorials I get a strong impression that you really know what youre doing However the learning experience with this particular videojust didnt feel good On the one hand during grad a school a professor once told me that in grad school Im learning how to learn so I understand that there will be times when Ill just have to go out of my way to fill in the gaps when trying to learn something from someone like an instructor or something like a textbook On the other handit feels like there were a LOT of gaps to fill in with this video and during the lesson I wasnt sure what I was supposed to look up to fill in those gaps 

Maybe its because Im using a different version of software than what was used in the video or maybe our applications had been configured differenlty but I just could not create the stored procedure based off of the SQL code in the video and it wasnt until after I had seen the code on GitHub that I finally could Moreover I had to figure out how to open up a new tab to modify the stored procedure because I couldnt tell how you had done it in the video and then after that I had to figure out how to commit the changes that I had made to the stored procedure 

After having finished the video I did a search for the keyword GO since I had to use that to create the stored procedure and I thought Ohokay Thatkinda makes sense And then I did a search on how to create a stored procedure in SQL and then I finally thought Oh That makes sense Its likeeverything from CREATE PROCEDURE all the way up to GO inclusive was one big transaction or a collection of SQL statements that I have to be performed all together as one atomic unit Moreover the semicolon    doesnt seem to be necessary when coding in TSQL but explicitly typing that character out makes it clear at least to me where a statement or transaction is intended to terminate 

So once again thank you for your effort to explain these concepts You really do seem to be very knowledgeable on the material Im just concerned that key details are being inadvertently omitted because they seem like second nature to you as a function of your years of experience Take care",0
NrBJmtD0kEw,Bro you take the time to make videos and put them on YouTube but you cant be bothered to do a basic mic check before you start filming kind of lazy bro Audio quality is total shite Its like reverse ASMR and highly irritating Sounds like you just used the built in mic on your laptop WHILE youre typing on it what the fuck,0

NrBJmtD0kEw,It was nice video and easy  to understand Thank you so much,1
NrBJmtD0kEw,You have not mentioned that after modifying the stored procedure we need to execute it in order to ensure the modified stored procedure is the one that runs when we do EXEC TestEmployee,0
NrBJmtD0kEw,deus te abenoe,0
NrBJmtD0kEw,this video was a little bit complicated for me,-1
NrBJmtD0kEw,I am unable to run the INSERT into tempemployee chunk of code I even copied and pasted from Alex code I receive this message  Invalid object name tempemployee Any ideas on what I could be doing wrong,-1
NrBJmtD0kEw,"ok so immediately after creating my stored procedure i ran into the problem of it not being in the right database even though i did everything correctly and without syntax errors if you also have this problem im writing this comment to hopefully help sorry itll be a long read
so like i said my stored procedure was not in my SQL Tutorial database as intended and after some searching through my own files still nothing i read a comment saying that someone found their stored procedure in the master database so i checked in there and there it was so if you havent been able to locate your own yours may be there after locating it i looked up how to move the stored procedure to the right database and the steps i followed are here with my notes in brackets

1 Go the server in Management Studio
2 Select the database right click on it Go to Task
3 Select generate scripts option under Task
4 and once its started select the desired stored procedures you want to copy for this step i chose to just open the script in a new query window so i didnt have to download a file and work more quickly but choose the method that is best for you


now once you have the script of the stored procedure pulled up look to the very top at what i guess to be the USE statement the database in which the stored procedure is in will be in brackets go to the USE and change the name of the database to the one in which you want to be the location of the stored procedure once you change the database as needed execute the whole thing and you should be good to go be sure to check for the location and refresh as needed to make sure everything went smoothly before moving on please note that these steps may not be helpful if you made a typo or anything so check your query that created the stored procedure to see where you may have an issue i suppose in the future for creating objects such as stored procedures and anything else that needs a location specified placing that USE statement when you first write the query may be the best course of action im still new to this so there may be better ways to do this at any rate i hope this helps 

edit an additional note i learned that to specify the database location you must use GO directly after the USE statement otherwise youll get an error saying that the CREATE statement must be first not totally sure what the GO does in this case if anyone knows please share   so when youre creating your stored procedure for the temp table write this right before your CREATE statement 
USE  
GO

your desired database will go in the brackets of course  then you should be good to go to continue writing your query

edit 2 I double checked in my master database and saw i had a copy of my TEST stored procedure so i just deleted them once i made sure i moved them to my desired database so do with these copies as you see fit",1
NrBJmtD0kEw,where can I find the tempemployee table you created within the procedure I could not find it anywhere,0
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I was slightly struggling with it to follow along so here is the steps to actually get the same result 
1 You write a stored procedure drop table if exists create table inset into and select  finish with GO you can also wrap the whole thing in BEGIN all queries END
2 Run what you wrote all of it
3 Exec store procedure name
4 Modify  add parameter 
5 Run the whole thing again  I mean the modify query
6 Exec  store procedure name your parameter",0

NrBJmtD0kEw,"For those using SQLite this DBMS doesnt support Stored Procedures For people using MySQL the Stored Procedures is quite different Below is the way how I did the first and second examples Finally there is no way to modify the parameters or the body stored procedure in MySQL so you must drop it and create another one using DROP PROCEDURES IF EXISTS

Example 1
DELIMITER 
CREATE PROCEDURE TEST 
BEGIN 
SELECT  FROM Employee
END 
DELIMITER 
CALL TEST

Example 2
DELIMITER 
CREATE PROCEDURE Test 
BEGIN  
		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS TempEmployee
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempEmployee JobTitle VARCHAR 50 EmployeeperJob VARCHAR 50 AvgAge INT AvgSalary INT 
		INSERT INTO TempEmployee
		SELECT JobTittle COUNTJobTittle AVG Age AVG Salary  
		FROM Employee emp INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary sal ON empEmployeeID  salEmployeeID
		GROUP BY JobTittle
SELECT  FROM TempEmployee

wnapnTAMj68,"To enrollees  potential enrollees I stress having a sense of healthy urgency to complete this program It is not a course per say Courses are individual modules adding up to a full specialization program or professional certificate it is a number of courses rolled into a program where one should pace themselves to actually LEARN the materials  not speed rush through it just to obtain a certificate 

However you can still review the materials after youve finished if you rushed through it I dont recommend this method because most ppl dont typically commit themselves 2 do that And dont cheat You only short or limit yourself if you dont properly leverage the programs skills  training the right way 

Employers are generally not hiring based on your techhard skills alone or at all which can be more or less OTJ training anyway They are hiring more so based off of your soft skills Faking it until youre making it usually dont always apply So build on your business acumen or portfolio after SUCCESSFULLY completing the program  let the program work FOR you not against you

wnapnTAMj68,Hey Not sure if anyone  has experience with this course but a question Do I just trust the course and go through it A to Z or would you recommend stopping after the introduction to topics early on to go for a deeper dive into a topic Ex After being introduced to SQL Im not really clear yet Do I stop and work on it or keep moving forward and the course will come back and really reinforce it Thanks,0
wnapnTAMj68,I absolutely loved this course I am 2 months in and almost finished Ive just started the 8th module today Complete a Case Study Its a bit overwhelming and theres not much guidance as to how to best utilize the skills Ive learned so far I suppose thats part of the selflearning aspect of the program though Im very glad I found your channel I have a feeling It will soon become one of my favorites,1
wnapnTAMj68,Wow what a phenomenal video  Stumbled across this while researching the topic  Great overview of this certificate  I do think that google certs are changing the game and they are only going to get better as network effects start to build,1
wnapnTAMj68,Can you do a updated video on this,0
wnapnTAMj68,I will use this as a beginner cert before I start go to college for this field  cheap tester trial with a cert to boot,1
wnapnTAMj68,Selfpaced learning is a great mode for learning I have been working towards a library technician certification as a precursor towards beginning my MLIS A friend of mine encouraged me to check out this certificate and its process for data analytics I was wondering what you thought about his after having completed the Google certificate I am still looking things over before I make a decision I think it will be a good decision and direction for me Great video Alex Little Mountain Lion,1
wnapnTAMj68,Just finished the certificate today Whoooooo that was a tough one,-1
wnapnTAMj68,just over half way through  so far so good,1
wnapnTAMj68,Based on real world experience could someone coming from another financial background take this course and hope to get an analyst job paying a little more than the 69k average,0
wnapnTAMj68,Sooooo sign up for this analytics certificate program ORRRR data analytics bootcamp for 8k hmmmm,0

wnapnTAMj68,Hi Alex thank you very much for the thorough review Is it possible to take this specialization with mac M1 or I need a window laptop,1
wnapnTAMj68,Can someone with no prior programming knowledge become a data scientist,0
wnapnTAMj68,Should I learn SQL first or they will cover it in course itself,1
wnapnTAMj68,The only problem I seem to be having is how to get started with a case study Could you give me some advice,0
wnapnTAMj68,Hey Alex great video I have some doubts about the payment structure Im from India and its like 3k rs for 6 months  So is it course wise like do I have to pay for each course 3k rs  Or I complete all 8 courses in 6 months  Pls help me with this,1
wnapnTAMj68,505 to be continued,0
wnapnTAMj68,should i take another excel curse along with this curse if i dont have any experience or is it enough just with this course,0
wnapnTAMj68,3 courses down 5 to go Maybe its just me but I really feel like they spend way too much time reiterating things and a lot of the videos provide little or no value   They also talk very slow and pause a lot I sped all videos up to at least 15 and it made it more bearable,0
wnapnTAMj68,Hi Seeing that the Google course teaches Tableu how can the learner access it when it is a subscriptionbased app,0
wnapnTAMj68,So I guess we study Python after this course,0
wnapnTAMj68,700000 have taken it last year Is that my competition,0
wnapnTAMj68,I think Python is a language anyone can teach themselves hence the choice of R is well advised With R possibly Python is walking downhill,0
wnapnTAMj68,Its not worth it But this is a google platform so why wouldnt they lie,-1
wnapnTAMj68,Yeah plus you can listen to their videos at 2x speed,0
wnapnTAMj68,"Hello Captain Alex

My name is Anand I am a graduate in Finance with no exposure to Technical knowledge like programming Python SQL etc 

So my question is Can I still pursue GoogleIBM course on Data Analytics as this involves the programming languages 

If yes do these courses offer training from basics Please help",0
wnapnTAMj68,How much is the course per month,1
wnapnTAMj68,I have google sheets and google slides do I buy other programs or will google give them to me to use for the certificate course And how easy and interesting are these courses,1
wnapnTAMj68,"Hi Alex thanks for the information 
Can you please tell what happen of we are not able to complete all courses in the one month",0
wnapnTAMj68,"Hey guys would you recommend working on different courses throughout week 1 then week 2 and so on or better focus on 1 course at a time finish it as fast as possible and then move on to the next one

Thank you in advance",1
wnapnTAMj68,I plan to start this course soon I have a cheap laptop currently do I need to get a good laptopdesktop before I start doing to course Thanks for the video,1
wnapnTAMj68,Whats the system requirements Software requirements Can this be done on laptop or tablet or mobile as well,0
wnapnTAMj68,I enrolled to it  I hope Ill become a data analyst,-1
wnapnTAMj68,So Ive heard that the Google course is great for students within the US but awful for those of us outside the US Im on week 3 and Ive seen some comments from people outside the US who finished the course and are saying it has been impossible to find a job even after 6 good months of consistent search for worldwide offers also looking for US jobs etc nothing nothing ever happening can anyone please share some info on this I dont want to waste my time studying something that wont give me a job,0
wnapnTAMj68,Where do you writeexecute the R or SQL code when practicing exercises or solving the case studies Does the course comes with an online practice space,0
wnapnTAMj68,Hi Alex Did you complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification How do you rank it Thanks,-1
wnapnTAMj68,Just finished the entire course It was fantastic but not easy It was definitely challenging,1
wnapnTAMj68,Hi Alex greetings from Costa Rica I really enjoy your videos keep going One question In order to obtain the certificate is the course 8 Capstone Project required Thanks,1
wnapnTAMj68,I am on my 3rd week of course 1 Its going good so far,1
wnapnTAMj68,Upon completion of this course do you know any other courses that will take our skill to another level,-1
wnapnTAMj68,there are people who spend their lives growing radishes and those that spend their lives cooking crystal meth both should have the same criminal penalty,-1
wnapnTAMj68,Can anybody let me know that whether I can work on this course on a Mac,0
wnapnTAMj68,Can someone please confirm if this certificate has an expiration date after which it will need to be renewed No one seems to be talking about that and googling it only shows results for something else Analytics IQ from the Academy,0
wnapnTAMj68,I took this course and completed it within 4 weeks DecJan which is an absolute steal having to pay for just a month The course is very beginner friendly and I like that Google put a lot of effort in teaching the non technical aspect of data analytics also which will come in handy in landing a job and on the job as well Thanks Alex for all you do,1
wnapnTAMj68,I have a question regarding this certificate and is that 1053month is for full 8 courses or for single course anyone knows anything then please tell me,1
wnapnTAMj68,but how much weight does the cert hold will it actually get a career switcher a job,0

duMcYRtQITA,Course is now live Link Here,1
duMcYRtQITA,"I am in process to pass this specialization By for now Ive done 3 of 8 courses

Also Ive improved my knowledge by studing from your videos about SQL and try to figure out how to use it in practice

Its so good to have a resource like yours to get several good tips in this way to become a Data Analyst

Thanks a lot",1
duMcYRtQITA,221 So you got 130k more subscribers in a niche industry in less than a year That is impressive,1
duMcYRtQITA,For those complaining about R over Python just learn SQL and Tableau first With these 2 plus the Python you already knew even if you dont know R thats still a pretty strong resume,1
duMcYRtQITA,"I have enrolled for Googledata analytics certificate course
I also have completed module1  but I have a doubt do I need enroll in different modules separately",0
duMcYRtQITA,isnt it free now,1
duMcYRtQITA,I finished this course recently I learned alot but the case study is a mess The data files are too large to load in R SQL or Google Sheets I keep reaching out to people in the forums about how to work around it but no one has responded Seems like the people who completed the case study already had experience in data analytics Really disappointed in this What good is it to learn functions and formulas if you cant even load a dataset Dont get me started on the mess that is Qwkilabs,0
duMcYRtQITA,I want to do yours but Prices are too high rs8640sir please do something,1
duMcYRtQITA,Would you recommend this over Microsoft certified Data Analyst associate for improving brand recognition in resume,0
duMcYRtQITA,currently studying it In course 3 they try kaggle but they do not explain well about the platform and one is left without understanding it,0
duMcYRtQITA,hi bro im wondering if i subscribed to coursera plus  is this google certificate course included,0
duMcYRtQITA,Will this certification will be helpful to get placed in any well know companies,0
duMcYRtQITA,"This along with covid numbers will combine for a load of go along to get along bullshit that is science fiction epic

A load of crap for idiots who need to that approval feel complete",-1
duMcYRtQITA,Wow I just enrolled this course,0
duMcYRtQITA,I dont think this will help people with no college degree I think this is super beneficial for people who have a degree and just want to learn the technical skills required for a career change into data analysisanalysis in general,1
duMcYRtQITA,"Sir Im from India
If I do this course and complete it will I be able to apply and get a job in the US Or will I be able to apply for jobs in India only

Please respond Thank you",1
duMcYRtQITA,would you recommend this course to anyone focusing more on ML and DL,1
duMcYRtQITA,You look like more bald James Rolfe,1
duMcYRtQITA,"The reason for R instead of python is
Pythons strong suit is not I repeat not data analysis python is a good substitute for shell scripting",1
duMcYRtQITA,You are a liar,0
duMcYRtQITA,Sir what do u suggest IBM Data Analytics or Google Data Analytics,0
duMcYRtQITA,Does the Data Analyst or UX Design have more scope,1
duMcYRtQITA,im torn between the google cert for data analytics vs ux design is da at risk of being automated the same way accounting will be i fugure ux design is safer since its creativity,0
duMcYRtQITA,Currently a Real Estate Studies master student with roughly 15 years of studies left to go before trying to land a starting position at a real estate consultancy firm Do you reckon this course would be a good addition I believe it is as Ive had a bunch of conversations recently at firms such as Deloitte and CBRE whove recommended me to get acquainted with data science prior to graduating,1
duMcYRtQITA,Thanks man,1
duMcYRtQITA,Hey Alex can you do a comparison of this and the IBM data analytics course on Coursera I think other people may be in the same boat as me as Im trying to decide between the two options,0
duMcYRtQITA,amazing news,1
duMcYRtQITA,I have a math education degree but decided I wanted to switch carreers after I graduated I am currently working my way through data science specialization through Johns Hopkins in coursera which uses strictly r After I complete that which would be a better routein your opinion  take the Google certificate start applying for jobs or take a certificate that uses something other than r to widen my skill rangeresume,1
duMcYRtQITA,So if I complete this certification and also have a bachelors degree in stats and have couple python capstone projects should I apply to work at Google Because  why wouldnt they hire someone if they completed their course,0
duMcYRtQITA,"I have been working as Powercenter ETL developer the last years I left the Way of Data Analytics some years ago so this course could be useful to refresh my R skills and come back to the Way of Analytics

Do you think this certificate is a good choice for veterans data analyst who left the Way of Analytics some years ago",1
duMcYRtQITA,Well its up now,0
duMcYRtQITA,Thanks for sharing this information,1
duMcYRtQITA,Could you plz make a compariaon between google certificate and IBM certificate for data analysis and which the best on coursera,1
duMcYRtQITA,There are no jobs for this in my state  I just spent an exhaustive morning and could not find a single job opening in the state of Florida for a data analyst  I expanded my search and found only three in the US and the minimum requirements is a bachelors degree certification and 5 years experience  That was for a job that pays 39k  What am I missing,0
duMcYRtQITA,i just like to point out courses 7 and 8 starts in april the enrollment button says so so if you are like me who is trying to finish the course quickly it is probably better to wait until the whole courses are online,1
duMcYRtQITA,This might be a dumb question but do we need to know R prior to taking this course,-1
duMcYRtQITA,Hello Please do you know if google will employ Nigerians that complete this course,0
duMcYRtQITA,I joined Google IT Support course last week and by the end of the course Id surely join the data analytics class Thanks man for the info,1
duMcYRtQITA,Any info if the certificate will be available to people in the EU,1
duMcYRtQITA,R can be better for statistical analysis get out your stats books Do I prefer R to python hell no But will learning it make me a better data scientist yes Also if you have what the competition doesnt have better your chances,1
duMcYRtQITA,Is anyone doing online study groups Im interested on getting with a groups of individuals to study together,1
duMcYRtQITA,please can you estimate how much it will  cost  a person to attempt the course,1
duMcYRtQITA,Super excited for this one,1
duMcYRtQITA,Im also sad that they are using R instead of Python,-1
duMcYRtQITA,I think python would be in an advanced next coming course after this one,1
duMcYRtQITA,Awesome thank you for consideration Anyone know when they are going to release the course,1
duMcYRtQITA,"How exciting 
I cannot imagine using R instead of Python either but Im sure theres a method their madness I look forward to following up and seeing what youve found and if its worth it to take this course its only 40 Just found your channel and Ill be pushing that subscribe and notification button right now

duMcYRtQITA,Just a suggestion instead of having two folders in bookmarks there is also an option to have separate chrome profiles,0
duMcYRtQITA,I have a question Ive been studying SQL on my own and I feel like Im doing great BUT at times I feel so overwhelmed at the amount that I feel I need to memorize in order to be considered for a data analyst position Is this true Or do you just need the basics and learn as you go,1
duMcYRtQITA,So funny to see fights between R and Python people  learn more languages and grow as a person,1
duMcYRtQITA,Hey Alex sorry to keep asking but when do you plan on doing the data analyst project tutorials for entry levels Also would you ever consider releasing  your own course on udemy Based on exactly the things you use on your day to day role as well as exactly the things you learnt that helped you finally land your first role in data analysis,1
duMcYRtQITA,"Hello everyone Can anyone confirm me that the course is only open to US and Canada residents
Ive been waiting for this course but Im from Europe",0
duMcYRtQITA,R and Python as well as a collection of nix utilities for that matter are equally useful to know in the context of data analytics,1
duMcYRtQITA,New subscriber here Looking forward to this Google Cert Switching careers after Covid hit,1
duMcYRtQITA,What a coincidence I was just searching for an R programming course about analytics I guess now I just have to wait  haha,1

duMcYRtQITA,Shit Im in this stupid one from simplilearn thats so stupid way too fast paced for me,-1
duMcYRtQITA,Would you say that this certificate is for people trying to get into analytics and not so much for people already working in the field andor those with a related degree If im already doing basically everything laid out in the curriculum on a daily basis and have a secure job in the field what types of value add could this or other comparable data analytics coursescerts bring for me Seems like a lot out of content is for people trying to enter the field and not for those a couple years in,0
duMcYRtQITA,Hey Alex can you do a video that talk about Business Intelligence BI and whats different between data analyst and BI analyst Thanks,0
duMcYRtQITA,Hello Alex  do you have Instagram or something that i can contact you for some career advice about data analysis it wont take a lot of time of course,0

Thanks",1
duMcYRtQITA,Another great video  Thanks Alex for the inputs,1
duMcYRtQITA,Google have another course for process automation that teaches python Im in grad school for business analytics and insights It really makes me questions if I want to continue my studies and jump to Google I think the Google brand is a lot more recognizable than most schools  If the training I receive is good enough to work for Google I should be getting a job elsewhere is the thinking,1
duMcYRtQITA,Google courses are so far not very good made,0
duMcYRtQITA,So even if people who live outside the US or Canada can use a VPN to access it we wont get the career services,0
duMcYRtQITA,Why Tableau and not Power BI,0

duMcYRtQITA,Thanks for the update been waiting for this since covid started what a tease,1
duMcYRtQITA,Thank you for your sacrifice struggling through R instead of Python We will build monuments in the future of your sacrifice,0
duMcYRtQITA,Wheres excel and Power BI  And who needs R today  You dont even need python itself Most of the work can be done with Python autoML libraries,1
duMcYRtQITA,Sar Zip code is not added,0
duMcYRtQITA,Sir  The language of Data analystics is not in English but in Hindi,0
duMcYRtQITA,Yesterday I finally decided to take the IBM Data Analyst course and this came out now I dont know what to do,0
duMcYRtQITA,I know they mentioned no previous experience is required but still I am going to ask this question do i need to have knowledge or exp in  R  or will they teach from basics,0
duMcYRtQITA,The Analyst do you think it is a good idea in getting both the IBM Data Analysis Certificate and Google Data Analytics certificate in order to improve the chances of landing an entry level job,1
duMcYRtQITA,Ive had the email updates on for about 6 months now Now the hype is real,1
duMcYRtQITA,"Hello Alex

Please can you try n get some discounts for your subscribers",0

Alex the Analyst for a reason 

And i know the course is going to be of great quality because its been from Google

And",1
duMcYRtQITA,I think its important to know that we dont have to learn everything from one source I am doing a BI course and the lectures on Tableau were pretty quick and not easy to grasp I had to look up another source for tutorials on Tableau and now I understand it better and I can continue with the initial course,1
duMcYRtQITA,What about in Coursera IBM Data Analysis course  I completed it I it helpful,0
duMcYRtQITA,Thank you for the great content looking forward to the future videos on the course,1

pYRG5X7110M,I know this is an old video but should you learn regular statistics before statistics for data science,0
pYRG5X7110M,Alex I am Happy I found you I subscribed to your channel and guaranteed I am going to follow your videos and thanks for bringing all these topics esp for DAs in one place,1
pYRG5X7110M,Will this course be good for managers leading a group of data analysts I need to quickly get up to speed and have some form of a refresher since the last time i deal with statistics was 10 years ago Thanks,1

pYRG5X7110M,Great video  but have to admit after watching it that Im not really buying into the idea that anyone can learn this  That formula you shared looked super intense and Ive never done anything nearly that complex   Is basic highschool algebra enough to get someone going in this or should there be something before this,1
pYRG5X7110M,hi alex I want to know if this course is enough for working as a data analysis Do I need to learn more  If I do what kind of areas I need to go through Great video thanks a  lot,1
pYRG5X7110M,Is the code still valid anyone who has signed up recently Should I take this course as a prep course for Certified Analytics Professional CAP if I dont have a Stat background,0
pYRG5X7110M,Hey Alex I am already doing The Complete SQL Bootcamp Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla is it okay if I am a beginner,1
pYRG5X7110M,To my surprise Ive been taking this course in 365datascience since July Really a great course nice to see your recommandation as well thanks,1
pYRG5X7110M,Thanks Alex,1
pYRG5X7110M,You recommend any course for medical statistics I am a doctor and i want to use statistics for research purposes,0
pYRG5X7110M,Hi AlexCan you share a new code,1
pYRG5X7110M,Thank you for sharing this Although i personally like udemy as a general idea everything i found to be usefull on udemy had a completely free course on youtube too Either for Python C Java Javascript Data Analysis Excel and such So from my personal point of view udemy really needs youtuber to promote them because its youtuber who are the biggest threat to their business modell You can actually find whole university lectures on youtube for free and if thats not helpfull i dont know what is Also in combination with a couple of more practical videos like the ones you are providing i cant find real use in paying udemy for something that i can have 11 for free on youtube and often from people who know better than the guys on udemy,1
pYRG5X7110M,If anyone has done this course Id like to know how it is before I spend the money Does it really break things down into easy pieces,1
pYRG5X7110M,"Wow I have gotten a mentor for my data analytics career 
Thanks so much Sir for being there for beginnersthis video is really informative",1
pYRG5X7110M,Will this course provide me all the knowledge i need to know about statistics in data analytics field,0
pYRG5X7110M,best course for power BIsince I know stats python but starting to learn BI tools nd  planned to take power bipleaser recommend,1

pYRG5X7110M,Hi Alex what is the link to the page that has all the Udemy courses that you recommend to take,0
pYRG5X7110M,"Hello Alex
Thank you for your awesome videos as always

This was me some years backwe were practically doing all the data cleaningprepEDA and simply called it QA I had no idea until very recently that this is one of the most crucial stages in the DA DS process
The only thing back then was that I would ask over and over again what all the data we captured through all those expensive sensors would be used for and EVERYONE said they had no idea only that they knew it would be in a database end of story
Now that I know about data science and its subfields its all making sense to me now",1

pYRG5X7110M,Hello Alex I have a diploma in business Administration Do you think I can qualify for a Bachelors degree in statistics or are there short courses that can lead me to that If yes what are the requirements for the short courses and how long are they,0
pYRG5X7110M,Not sure if youve addressed this before in another video but what if youre like terrible at math like barely got through secondary school taking math,-1
pYRG5X7110M,So statistic for data analyst and data science are the same thing,0

pYRG5X7110M,"Hey Alex
As usual I followed your advice and enrolled in this course
Nothing but great content Although I had to deal with statistics during my studies this course is really helpful to brush up important topics and is explained really good
I do Really appreciate your videos thanks a lot",1
pYRG5X7110M,awesome topic alex been googling best sources for statistics for awhile and happy to see you made a vid on the topic much appreciated,1
pYRG5X7110M,Hi Alex This was great info I know you dislike bootcamps but I joined one lol I was overwhelmed with trying to get the info I needed streamlined Im actually about to start learning statistics in the program but I want to learn a bit before I start Thanks,1
pYRG5X7110M,Finally a channel that addresses data analytics in details Thank you for starting this channel Or put it the other way  I am happy that I found your channel,1
pYRG5X7110M,Hey Alex I often watch your videos because they help me a lot but I think analytical thinking is also important could you talk about how to improve analytical thinking Thank you so much,1
pYRG5X7110M,Nice video again Just a random question are doing side projects as important for getting a data analyst job compared to something like a software developer,1
pYRG5X7110M,Digging your channel All your info is really straightforward  Can you put a video together covering hardware requirements and preferences,1
pYRG5X7110M,Alex you seem to have studied hundreds of courses for your DA role mehnnnn How did you study all those Did you make notes or did you just to memorize as much as possible,0
pYRG5X7110M,"Hi Alex

How are you I remembered asking you this question last year And you didnt have any proper recommendations then
But I undertook this  Udemy course It is really very fantastic I must say this is the best course

Also I want you to have a look at Mavel Analytics online course which is a complete package of Excel Tableau SQL and PowerBI
Right now I am undertaking this course and enjoying it a lot

Thanks

pYRG5X7110M,For someone whos is interested in BIBA how much stats would you say to learn,1
pYRG5X7110M,hi alex what is the best way to study using the course i struggle memorizing formulas for a long time and was wondering if you took notes or just listened to the instructor,1
pYRG5X7110M,I failed AP Statistics in High School thought I would never use it again lol now Im learning p value and realized the answer closer to 0 is the greater value haha Ex P value 065  alpha 005,1
pYRG5X7110M,this video is really informative,1
pYRG5X7110M,I just completed this course along with SQL  again one of your recommended one  I do have experience working on advanced excel what should be my next course of action to be able to apply for a experienced data analyst rolelike what projects and from where Please guide,1
pYRG5X7110M,I get so many questions on this Thanks Alex This isnt an easy find and theres no automatic answer like Andrew Ng ML course Very helpful,1
pYRG5X7110M,Hey Alex love all your videos can you make one on deep learning,1
pYRG5X7110M,Thank for uploading just thinking to ask you about this and here we go,0
NViKsiGP4TY,So the SQL course was good up until a point I did notice after watching your videos that Dataquest did teach some notsogreat habits ie using aColumnName bColumnName for joins Also if you do their excel courses it is possible for other learners to access your work even though they said it shouldnt be happening I did have someone constantly coming in and deleting my data which was frustrating for projects,0
NViKsiGP4TY,Might help to get a new version of this video Data quest has added tableau and power bi along with other career paths now,0
NViKsiGP4TY,However Datacamp has some advantages some of which are price and website layout which makes it preferable,0
NViKsiGP4TY,I did python basics before I hit the paywall in both dataquest and datacamp and I really prefer dataquest In datacamp they skip many details as if youre supposded to know them but in dataquest they are all covered,1
NViKsiGP4TY,My Dataquest experience has been horrible Their payment system is full of bugs I got charged wrongly and there is basically no customer support in Dataquest not even a telephone number you can call Plus they retained my credit card information without my consent after more than a year and I got a surprise bill My tip is stay away from this platform if you dont want headaches,-1
NViKsiGP4TY,Is dataquests lifetime access for around 700 usd worth it or yearly subscription should do the trick Please advise Thanks,1
NViKsiGP4TY,you lost me at if you like reading no i hate reading rather get a video as Im a visual learner lol,1
NViKsiGP4TY,Yes they use Jupyter notebooks in guided projects,0
NViKsiGP4TY,12 Anyone who had paid for the course can you answer this question from Alex,0
NViKsiGP4TY,Could you do one for codecademy Thanks,1
NViKsiGP4TY,"Use the below link for a 15 discount on a Dataquest subscription

NViKsiGP4TY,"Ive used dataquest and Datacamp I prefer dataquest because of two things
The first is personal Im a reading person Im not able to learn following videos 
But there is a different thing Dataquests career path are more cohesive 
Datacamp has multiple skill paths and they just combine them in some bigger career path This create the following problem In many moments videos do not build in previous videos 
So you may learn how to do something with a specific package and then in the next set of videos a different package is used or the reexplain a package already covered in other course

In dataquest as they have fewer paths it seems that they are always buillding on top of previous courses This is great for solidifying your knowledge",1
NViKsiGP4TY,Usually his videos have credibility However in this case the video is too long and with too much guessing because he doesnt have enough access to actually see the content Consequently hes reviewing what he thinks is in the product,0
NViKsiGP4TY,I think you should have subscribed for at least 1 month or trial a little deeper before making video,-1
NViKsiGP4TY,Hey Alex I remember you recommended an SQL book to check out on one of your previous videos Can you tell me the name please,-1
NViKsiGP4TY,"Heres a thing We are working on certain project and sending the newest versions of pbix file to each other But despite the desktop version of power bi its hard to build a pathway of data source each time we need to open file and work with it Have you faced such problems Do you have any advices  

Thanks in advance",0
NViKsiGP4TY,Hey Alex Iam doing a comp sci degree in my first yearand been watching a lot of your videos very interested in data analytics What side projectsskills would you recommend for me to take part in To Almost guarantee a data analytics internship  placement in my second year thank you,1
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hi Alex hope you and your family is doing well now
there are a lot of universities now days providing MS degree diploma certificate programs on data analytics like George Mason University could you review those curriculum as well if possible and if one should go for an one year degree program TIA",0
NViKsiGP4TY,Can you make a video if you were to restart learning data analytics again where you would start A very beginners guide theres so many resources but Im not sure where to start Thanks Alex love the content keep up the good work,1
NViKsiGP4TY,Thanks for the review Alex Would you make a video about Business intelligence Analyst anytime possible I hear about it frequently these days How different is it from data analyst,0
NViKsiGP4TY,Dataquest coursera or data camp for data analyst,0
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hey Alex
I hope you and your family have stay safe in the storm",1
NViKsiGP4TY,I think you should pay for the premium version to do full review this review is not comprehensive enough,1
NViKsiGP4TY,"Whats wrong with the good old MOOCs 
Coursera for instance has good data science specializations taught by worldclass experts from known Universities",1
NViKsiGP4TY,Hm the website doest seem to be worth the money,1
NViKsiGP4TY,how are you doing after the storm hope that you and your family are doing great,1

Learned R using app now I create my own code for simple computations I need for work Excel  arithmetic 

Yes R has different way to write  functionexpressioncommands you want vs python They have similarities as well

I plan to learn python within this month July Just finishing some of my notes from learning R

Discovered R compiler online  and using codes I created I no longer will use calculator Just use R compiler 

Also use R to excel No need to  create cells in Excel anymore 

just write codes test it on compiler then run it on actual R studio then placed on excel at my documents in computer Creating Excel sheet in faster time

1gdKC5O0Pwc,I thought R had many issues Then I tried Python and I found it has the same issues but worse,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Python is a general programming language R is a statistical programming language Obviously Python cannot compete with R when it comes to statistics and R cannot compete with Python when it comes to programming in general,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"You said Python is better than R then said its just my opinion You should have clarified that in the post that its just my opinion 

But you wrote a single statement that Python is better than R Any person reading that would think that you are stating this as a fact This is why it was controversial 

Adding the words its just my opinion or its more suitable for my job would have taken the controversy out of it Perhaps you just wanted to stir up unnecessary controversy for attention",1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R start vector indexing from 1 not 0 It really did a great job of making programmers ANGRY,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Alex your level of R is beginner with all due respect There is a noticeable bias in his speech 

In general because Python is more related to C and programming languages in general it is easier for programmers R is easier for people with no prior programming knowledge they learn to program as long as they learn to use R They can use R on a daytoday basis without delving into functional programming objectoriented programming and so on

The scalability issue is real IT teams like Python best for launching products because its their comfort zone However its easier to build a dashboard or application in R Give it a try

I agree with the argument that there is no best but it is necessary to reduce the bias of our point of view to make a comparison",1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Simple fact is that a good programmer in either language can handle 95 of data analytics tasks easily,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Sorry but I disagree with most of what you said First off all R is the best for bioinformatics Python is limited For example There are no besides a poor copy of diseq2 packages to deal with differential gene expression In R you have tens of them Speed Unfortunately you know nothing about R targets qs fastr etc most of high performance libraries in R are compiled with C C or Fortran How can you beat this with slow python Parallelisation is supported by default olin R targets and very easy to implement using future and other packages Plotting Are you serious There is nothing better than R  I think that your comparison is unbiased and unfair You just dont have enough experience with R RMarkdown Quarto  R targets and you can do EVERYTHING in bioinformatics Python is just the best as a general purpose language R is sophisticated That is it PS R shiny  Did you missed it,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Its insane how many times you had to ask ahead for forgiveness to avoid potentially offending anyone We are all different and haver different opinions  get over it people Very cool video mate As a statistician Im very in love with R but Im trying to learn Python as I am very aware of its coverage and power Cheers,1

1gdKC5O0Pwc,R has a lot of CERN libraries that are very helpful,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I learned R and Python and I can say R is much easier to learn but Python is way more robust  I replaced a VBA code that creates MS Excel workbooks from a template and it took like 3 seconds to complete  Using R took like 45 seconds After I saw the benefits and speed of Python  I put R aside and focus on Python,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Both are needed once things get a little advanced,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I usually do my data manipulation on python then push the final data to R for statistics Idk R is just easier and cleaner when it comes to statistical models but tough to manipulate data with while in Python it is super easy to manipulate data with but put a gun to my head I still refuse to use it for statistical models bc god damn it is confusing to me lol,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,When I get to know Python I immediately throw away everything I know about R from my brain into rubbish bin                      LOVE PYTHON,1

1gdKC5O0Pwc,Pythons data structure is more suitable for data science too Pythons data structure Dictionary is just another name of json data set Rs list can do similar job however simply not the same form as json,1

I remember some years ago I was talking to a COBOL programmer and he was whining about how he lost his job because of I dunno I think it was C or C or something in anywise all I could think was well why dont you just learn the new stuff  It didnt make him happy  Either way Im going to pursue R and Python just so I have a bunch of tools in my toolbox  Bottom line is programming is programming and I dont find a ton of difference between Java from 18years ago in the area of semantics  Boolean loops arrays etc etc etc",1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,what I find nice about R ist the combination with RStudio and the support for Markdown and embed the R code And then you get out PDF or web page And you can also work with Latex So maybe you can not embed R in a typical web page but otoh you can build web site and PDF nicely with RStudio without the need of additional software,1

1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I would like to see a second part video comparison focused on comparing R and Python languages from a business standpoint rather than their more generalpurpose  programming capabilities for building applications and heavy used of sophisticated statistics that do not apply to the average business world For instance many of us in business are hoping to learn which language is better for business analysis which after all is the trend in using either of these languages 

What we learn from the video is that R is being highlighted as useful in purely statistical analysis while the comparison with Python does not provide any insights into Pythons capabilities for statistical analysis R is being highlighted as great for statistical analysis however advanced statistics is mostly used by the scientific and academic community mostly as well as sophisticated business environments whereby most of these advanced statistics are not needed in the general business world

I would like to see the view from a business analystbusiness intelligence professional who has truly used both R and Python for exactly the same purpose using these languages for business analysis It would be great to move away from the generalpurpose and application development and get more into the business uses for each language and on what statistical and data analysis truly serves the vast majority of business users business intelligence and data analysts analyzing business related data

Looking forward to this second video Thanks Alex",1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Concerning which one  is easier to learnuse 
Depends how you think 

If you think in functions to solve the problem use R 
With objects go for Python 

For me you can do functional programming style with both Python and R and this is awesome

We can integrate python in our work flow in whatever form of shape we want it to 
Even like our beloved  functions

1gdKC5O0Pwc,Thank you for this video Alex I have always been intrigued by data analysis and want to learn more of the programming side I was not familiar with either of these programs but your breakdown of the two help If I wanted to learn both of these would it be easier to learn Python first then try to learn R or should I try to learn about R first then Python,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I am an economist trying to dedicate to data analysis and I still didnt understand the pros and cons of both so this video is exactly what I needed Thank you,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R syntax just makes me angry  What is wrong with you people Why are you talking like that,-1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Have you ever used Eviews,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Well Im have financial background and already learn Pythons basic from udemy and YouTube I guess Ill stick to Phyton Someone wise said that have a deep and specialty on one programming language is better than have understanding on multiple language but only on general Learn R again will wasting my time Im 30 yo and still have a dream to chase,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,So then is better the IBM Course Python what Google Course R,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Python is unquestionably more straightforward as a language in general However its fundamentally a generalpurpose scalar language not a vectordata language like R or a matrix language like matlab That fact makes the type of data manipulation and analysis that is meat and potatoes in R less convenient in Python Hello world is easier in Python but real data analysis is easier in R  I use Python for general programming but its just not worth the trouble to force Python to pretend to be R for data analysis econometrics or statistics Python is way way behind in all forms of data analysis For example Python is only now considering basic ideas like missing values being different from not a number values which the creators of R thought of and planned for from day 1 If I had to pick one language as better I might choose Python but its not better for data analysis which is whats being discussed here,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,data science and python r ssame,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I am finding that I absolutely despise Python and Visual Studio I mean I cant even run a simple command in terminal because I dont have pandas Like wut I have been using them in my script for the past 2 hours now I want to run a few simple commands Can I not switch between command line and the script Absolutely unfathomable Rstudio is soooooooo much better Not even in same category,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Do pirates prefer R  Rrrrrr ye matees,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,So which tool yall think would be better for conducting economic and financial analyses,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,i actually gave up on R as I moved to a more strategic role and away from hardcore data analysis i found it harder and harder just to recollect syntax across different libraries Plus I see Industry is tilting more and more towards Python and learning Python is kind of future proofing your time spent on it,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Thanks,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Dear Alex thanks for your review However no offense but referring to your arguments you know veeeery little of R R objects and visuals in particular can be easily embeded to web apps of any kind Plotly also exists in R and can be combined with ggplot which a heck of a boost in flexibility Next up mean of a column in R is as easy as meandatacolumn no need for pipes dude Therefore with all due respect if you spent more time on Python does not mean that its better and vice versa of course If R was so lame as u say Python would not adapt ggplot and more remarkably caret for ML and call it pycaret like seriously,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,too brief to be convincing,1
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I use both and sometimes combine them with matlab,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,dude terrible comparison you basically said python is better than R because for my personal needs python os better suited how tf is that an unbiased comparison between the two languages waste of time,0
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Dear All 

I am new bein into stats dS  Ml world I need your advice on What would work for me considering below background  

Rather then asking which one r or python is best  first I need to figure out what works form me    

My brain like  
For example I am very much comfortable in SQL  DAX  Power query style of thinking which are in general some where roughly categorized as functional programming languages my brain loves them 

With SQL DAX  Power query there are only limited keyword and some how my brain can easily figure it out no matter what the scenario is   I am also very much comfortable with Business intelligence type of work  

My brain dont like 
On other hand   My brain just too poorly with C  Java  Python   I simply could not get my head wrap around and I go blank  
its not about training or not about trying hard or practicing i tried all that  I just doo poorly with C Java  Python kind of languages  most importantly I get freaked out or struggle with fixing console compile errors with python java etc 


Do you think I should give R a shot considering my background or you would feel i would get similar challenges 

I would like to hear your view Please  Again I am not lazy to try out  I did tried  but you see I would like to take some advice to get me going",1

How can we do a proper case in SQL
Is there a way to do that",0
GQj6_6V_jVA,"And if we wanted to  lower case just the second letter of the name TOby for example or any other name in which the second letter is uppercase we could use the following 
LEFT meaning only the letters starting from the LEFT and the number 1 means only 1 letter Basically only the first left letter 
LEN meaning the length of the name so basically this will use the maximum length of the name 
SELECT FirstName UPPERLEFTFirstName1  SUBSTRINGLOWERFirstName2LENFirstName AS CorrectedName

But is there a better and shorter way",0

RF0LE3hYFrI,These tutorials are amazing Thanks so much Alex Question Why would a person use a temp table if it is just sessionspecific Why wouldnt one just create a new table using a past query so that it is stored permanently for use later,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Liking the video even before start watching it
Thats the faith I have on Alex",0
RF0LE3hYFrI,can you explain the meaning of varchar i get the int as integer type of data but what is varchar why not put string,0

RF0LE3hYFrI,thank You Sr 3,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,How do i improve the skill of knowing different ways to write a code for the same output Does learning python improves vocabulary of coding  I am aspiring data analyst and i want to master this skill of yours plz replyu speak simple and clear in ur videos Thanks,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,Hi Alex your tutorial are gamechanging for me can we combine a temporary table and cte,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,Why not to use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS instead of dropping it and recreating it again,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thanks really helfpul,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,Helpful video especially the DROP TABLE tip Thank you sir,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,"I normally use drop table if exists temp temp2 
For multiple tables do u know a way to drop more then 3 tables without listing them 

Eg I have 10 temp tables  
Instead of using this syntax drop table if exists temp temp2  etc 

Is there a better way to do this",1
RF0LE3hYFrI,Great helpful tutorials,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,Is it advisable to use a TempTable when importing data in PowerBi for a DirectQuery  So when Alex has the DROP TABLE IF EXIST and we would refresh our query would we get the latest data imported and stored in our TempTable or would PowerBI not even be able to bring back results  Thanks and I am getting more from this free course than my paid subscriptions  Great job Alex,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Thank you Alex You give the quickest easytounderstand tutoring I have received on my DA journey You explain these things well and you do not overload the learner with more than they need per time 
One helpful thing I do is practice while I watch and play around with it as you teach I often break something though and that helps too",1
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Thanks much alot 

Whenever I created and inserted data in temp table and shut down my computer and come back and select the temp table it doesnt work I have to Crete and insert datas again and again when ever I come back into it

RF0LE3hYFrI,Simple and functional as always thanks Alex data loves you,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thank you but I dont understand the advantage of temp tables Would ot using queries without them be faster You just added more steps This is my first time seeing a video regarding temp tables btw,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,I got exactly the information I was looking for and I started following your channel thanks,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,Once again a great tutorial This is the next concept in the Google data analytics course Thank you so much you made it smooth digestible,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,I would like to ask a question is there any book that you suggest to read for SQL Server  I want a book with full 100 documentation and to learn in deep SQL server,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,super thank you,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,Whats the point of creating a temp table over a regular view Is it mainly to do with storage efficiencies Why not just Drop the table when youre down with it Or is it because temp tables are good for stored procedures because its more efficient thanks just trying to figure it out,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,i lost you in creating temp employee2 why did you use select in the insert funct,0
RF0LE3hYFrI,You know whats magical  lifesaving  Putting a query result in  a temp table,1

RF0LE3hYFrI,Hello Alex thanks for these videos How can I delete duplicates on my table,1
RF0LE3hYFrI,"347 not quite sure but could someone clarify what SQLTutorial is referencing in the FROM clause here I understand EmployeeSalary is the table were storing into the temp table but SQLTutorial seems kinda random  Im assuming this is the name of the database EmployeeSalary is from but was it necessary to add that

8o-O6pR6yAE,Hello Mr Alex First of all thanks for all your videos  I have a question for you  What kind of system do you recommend to implement in a small or mediumsized company in order to obtain raw data for later analysis,0
8o-O6pR6yAE,Why would anyone waste time on such a worthless certificate I have not found a single job post where this cert was even mentioned No company thinks of IBM when discussing ML tools please save yourself some time and focus on real world projects,-1

8o-O6pR6yAE,I was thinking this video have the full IBM course for free but no problem,1
8o-O6pR6yAE,Oh man if you bring tutorials i would definitely get your material,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you for this video very clear and concise I am considering going into a career in data analytics and came across the IBM certificate program but wanted to learn more about it before paying for the courses I have a BS degree in Business Admin Management and really looking to do a career change This video helps,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Alex the way you explain everything  thats awsome,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks Alex,1

eFDbE5Yunj0,What type questions will be there in last assignment,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Do yall think I can complete this in 7 days  I have all the time in the world,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Peer grading is a joke  So someone who not even got their grade which could have been an F is grading me  Its stupid  I normally just check their code and for projects I basically just skim through what they had written,-1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can you stack the courses and combine at the end instead of purchasing the whole thing,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,should we need to complete all the 9  courses to get the certification or we get certificate for each separate course,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey Alex just a quick question Do they talk about data science mathematical concepts too,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,which one is better the ibm or google one,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is IBM Data engineer certificate for beginners Pls anyone tell me,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can we access this course through audit for free,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,great analysis alex definitely taking the course but i noticed its been updated and now has 9 modules as opposed to the 8 in your video They added a Python Project for Data Science Will you be updating the video,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey Alex  Its 2023  I was in the middle of taking this certification in early 2023 but stopped for a month and now its May  and Ive looked into returning to my studies I noticed that the IBM course no longer is offering Python but instead R  Any insights,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,I just finished high school and dont think Im going to go in college yet because of some financial and family issues but I want start this professional course My query is what is the next step is going to be when I complete this And am I going to get a well paid job right away after finishing this course,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,I have DataCamp and I just got the IBM Data Analyst professional certificate course from coursera Im not a data Analyst YET but so far I find DataCamp waaaay more hands on Ive completed several courses at DataCamp and I absolutely LOVE I got the IBM one this past week and Im still on module one and OMG tooooooo much blah blah blah and Im about to finish the first module and although the information is good zero SQL EXCEL PYTHONlike NADA Just a lot of talking about Data structure and etc Cant wait to finish the module 1 to see if it changes,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Really sorry but this is an overview review of the IBM data analyst course I am currently doing this right now and some of the courses such as 3 and 4 are challenging as the tutors are disinterested in teaching does not explain complicated concepts properly and you must have a good knowledge of python programming before enrolling
Also the 4 and a half5 star review of the course is an over statement
Anyone planning on doing this I would highly recommend you to have a good read of the comments and reviews
Thank you very much",1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey Alex Recent college grad here with a bachelors or science in IT currently studying for AWS certs I eventually want to become a data scientist but I first want to get some experience working with data and go for a data analyst position Is it a good idea if I do the IBM data science cert instead of the data analytics one and then learn tableau on my own Also do you recommend any sql or Spark certs,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,This was extremely helpful as I was looking into Google certs It seems as IBM does give a lot more for the same price and is teaching me skills are was interested in learning as well but on the side of learning this,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can I do the excel component in Libre Office Calc,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Remarkable content Quick question if I may when it comes to sponsored content from Coursera Would you recommend flat fee only or with commission on top I run a small edu YT channel,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Im currently in the middle of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Do you recommend I take the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate next or is it about the same info and I should move onto a different course,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is this certified by IBMor Google,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks for sharing,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,You are the one that has sealed the deal for me in moving forward thank you so much for your clear insight,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hi thanks for your review was really insightful One question thats I have is what should be my next step  Like which course would you recommend to do after completing this one  Thank  you,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,The course is a joke one the worst courses online I have ever done Online instruction is terrible plenty of problems on Coursera online support worst I have ever come across Poorly structured poorly exampled poor help Just a bad joke and I have done many online courses this by far the worst one,-1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hi Alex big fan of your videos Im currently taking this course and youre right its not really super advanced but its just what I need since Im a beginner I was curious if you have any suggestions for next steps Are there intermediateadvanced courses thatll give me more practical experience Or should I go on and start looking for internships and such,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can I follow this IBM data analyst program using Google sheet instead of Microsoft Excel,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,What job is an entry level job And also is a certification equal to a degree,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Please review edureka data analytics,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,May I know whats the total cost,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Im taking this course right now Honestly these courses are so buggy the lessons are either oversimplified or too complicated I dont feel like I learned a thing particularly in some of the Python courses The whole process was incredibly frustrating The moderators are helpful and answer your questions quickly and fix your problems but having so many issues is really disruptive to the learning process and I feel like Im going to have to do a lot more independent studying to actually learn the skills this course was supposed to teach me On its surface it looks clean and polished but I dont recommend taking it as its so surfacy and youll end up just having to take another one anyway,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey is this course outdated for 2022,-1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Ive got a question about Coursera what I havent found in their Q and As  if you subscribe for their monthly payment how will this work like in Patreon they take the money in the first day of the month or the payment is for a month from a day you started your subscription,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,will you be able to get an immediate job after completing an IBM certificate,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Not worth it The IBM Cloud access always fails and this prevents you from performing assignments So stressful Looking at the discussion forums in the course other learners encounter the same thing as well Wonder why they never get it fixed They shouldve stuck with simulators This is the error message Error Your account cannot be created at this time Code 327cbf60543a49caabffc46d9403d55d,-1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Im already taking the google data analytics course Would it be good to take this one as well after or just work on portfolio projects,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Great Video 
May I know the validly of this certification I mean IBM data analytics certification",1
eFDbE5Yunj0,YOU FORGOT TO MENTION THAT YOU WOULD ALSO NEED A DEGREE,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hello Alex is the peer grading too subjective Also how does it impact the entire grading and the progress made during the course Thank you for sharing,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Does this certificate have an expiry date just like the google data analytics professional certificate which is 1 year,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I hope your are honest and not paid to give positive review for the course I am right now at the middle of the course Honestly Excel and Cognos related courses are great However Python part is not so useful in terms of getting real coding skills and I enrolled to the course mainly because of Python for Data Analysis The problem if briefly is that it doesnt really explain the logic of coding which would allow you to continue learning by yourself further Instead it just give commands and you need just run them They skip many parts while explaining how codes works 

I hope at least the Certificate itself would have an impact in the eye of employer

But if you are really honest I really hope so and the job prospect is so indeed good with the the certificate I feel very optimistic",1

eFDbE5Yunj0,I majored in Religious Studies and minored in Economics in college Do you think it would be wise to do this certificate to get an entry level analyst job,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi Alex
Thanks for your video  What is the difference between this course offered on Coursera and edX  From what I can see on Coursera its 39month and you pay however long it takes you to complete it  But on edX its about 800 but you can take as long was you want to finish it  Seems like Coursera is the better deal",1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey Alex I love the channel Whats the difference between this course and the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate A video on this would also be great,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hi Alex Amazing videos you have One question for you and for everyone I actually work for the militaries and I dont have a degree but I want to change careers Would it be possible for me to get a job in an entry level position as a data analyst after finishing the IBM data analyst certificate,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks so much AlexIm finding these courses to be pretty light As you point out they are a good intro to some of the tools I really cant imagine these courses preparing your for real workI really dont have a lot of confidence in them  It would be really nice if someone could come up with some intermediate  and advanced courses that use these tool sets  and get us more job ready,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,I am in the process of completing a degree in Business with a major Project Management Im wanting to make a transition from finance into data analytics,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks for the review Alex I breezed through the first 3 courses in this certificate and felt super confident I could nail this in a couple of months time I must admit it got super hard from course 4  Python for Data Science AI  Development The learning curve is exponential Each of those 715 min videos took me 45 hours to complete with contact pausesplays The Python in this course is definitely not for beginners I completed the 4th course just for the sake of it but I dont believe I have mastered any of the skills Maybe Im not cut out for this program and should start from ground zero like comptia itf or Google IT Support But data analysisscience is something I would wish to pursue,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,What about the IBM and Google data analysis together,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,Great video Alex May I also ask if I finished the whole courses is it possible for me to find a job related to this course in the future without having any educational background aside from this online course,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you for this video So according to your description of the content of the course and the fact that Im finishing my Software Engineering degree soon  I have done a lot of work on python pandas SQL and that Im currently working a little bit with tensorflow and its documentation Do you think this course can add anything new,0
eFDbE5Yunj0,I want to switch from Accounting to Tech  data science are there  other certificates you suggest getting after achieving this one,-1
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Thank you
I got so much pleasure at this course and still in it and more excited to complete it all
Ive heard they offer courses for free on coursera for certain people or by chance
does any one of you guys know about that
I dont have any method to pay where i live",1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is it worth doing both Google and IBM certificates Asking because I just completed the Google one and I want to learn Python for data science,1
eFDbE5Yunj0,Absolutely valuable  Thanks a billion Alex  I had a very bad knee injury that made me stay home for almost a couple months now I was getting so frustrated until I came across your channel and Im now in the middle of my 3rd week already  Thanks again and keep it the awesome work,0

eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you for your content I relay enjoy watching and it helps me shape my decisions  I am currently taking this course and also saw your video about the Google Data Analytics Course Wich of the two Courses would you consider to give me better chances to get an entry lever job,1

eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi Just came across this course via EdEx and upon further investigation found out you can take it through coursera as well Why is there a price difference are they both covering the same stuff

D9bNctNnAig,You are the Best broh,1
D9bNctNnAig,"I have been using Datacamp for over 5 years on and off The best way to learn is to have 3 things open at the same time ChatGPT an IDE for SQL or Python R etc for whatever you  are learning to practice full code on the spot and trial and error and data camp
After each major lesson on Data Camp write the whole code on your own and use data camp to give your more context and clear example or to generate data for your small projects This is the best way to actually retain information The short Data camp videos may lack context or depth Chat GPT can help
Data Camp is useful for curriculum and exposure It provides an outline of in demand skills needed Avoid taking course in any platform that all they do is go over a programming language from A to Z like a dictionary you will not be able to retain and is not necessary to learn everything Just learn the skills you need to succeed for the industry you want to be in and practice doing real life projects that interests you",1

D9bNctNnAig,I got a yearly subscription at roughly 60 usd I think the courses are pretty decent for self learner begginers and the certification and job offers are good perks for those living in  USA Canada and Europe,1
D9bNctNnAig,Is it free,1

D9bNctNnAig,Hi any one needs data camp subscription for a year please reply,0
D9bNctNnAig,My men i got a sell off of 60USDyear 100 recommended,0
D9bNctNnAig,Browhich to take as beginner  data camp or Google data analytics certificate,0
D9bNctNnAig,"What I hate about them data camp is that they didnt updated the payment system for subscription in India
The reserve Bank of India put out a mandate asking all international cos to update their payments system acc to indian standards but many didnt comply
Now even if I want to i couldnt access to datacamp premium subscription",-1
D9bNctNnAig,What about 365 data science,0
D9bNctNnAig,Now its showing for just 575month is it worth it,1
D9bNctNnAig,Hey Alex so I have a Masters in Data Analytics Do you think Data camp is good for someone that needs brushing or wants to learn programs that I didnt learn in my program For example I didnt learn Power BI or R and my jobs requires alot of Power BI,1
D9bNctNnAig,To be clear the 25 monthly fee is paid as an annual subscription so you will actually be charged a onetime annual fee of 300  If you do choose to pay monthly then the cost is steeper at 39  Still a cool website and Im tempted but that gives me a little more pause to consider if I could pay 25 each month I would probably do it immediately,1
D9bNctNnAig,Thanks for the review I think its for me because Im a total beginner and will use it to supplement my learning while I take the BS Data Management Data Analytics program at WGU,0
D9bNctNnAig,Hello I am a 4th year student of Statistics I have enrolled for Google Data Analytics on Coursera Is it good,1
D9bNctNnAig,"data camp is worth it  though after you should work on big datasets with multivariable analysis to show you know awesome analysis
also you should know the time is way longer when you get to harder material",1
D9bNctNnAig,I like the R courses because they help you apply any theoretical knowledge youve learned about statistics in school like Machine Learning etc I like the Python courses because theyre fun especially the guided projects Ive used the videos for my classes it helps me go above and beyond what is expected from the professor,0
D9bNctNnAig,Today  May 2022 the Premium subscription for individual is 1242 billed annually,0
D9bNctNnAig,fair review from a fair unbiased analyst D,1
D9bNctNnAig,Thanks Alex for the summary of data camp,1
D9bNctNnAig,Question What website would you recommend for someone with NO experience and no base knowledge I am currently getting a degree in Cybersecurity and what to learn more in general,1
D9bNctNnAig,Okay I am a beginner and I must be the only one who hates Data Camp  The videos are too fast  I cant follow  Then they make you do the query and with no example to reference unless you go back to video  I am so frustrated,0
D9bNctNnAig,Great video The most relevant aspect to me are the projects Could you recommend another platform with endtoend solved project I need to start my BI machine learning portfolio Thank you,1
D9bNctNnAig,can u gey any type of a job with,0
D9bNctNnAig,Your channel has been immensely helpful for me figuring out where the hell to start I am currently on Codecademy on the DA path as well as taking the SQL on the side I am also learning through YOU and youtube videos I started Datacamp but I agree with alot of the  commenters Just code snippets and such Codecademy actually has me doing offplatform work and learning how to migrate data through PostgreSQL Anyway thanks Alex,0
D9bNctNnAig,Damn thats a good point about the lack of IDE usage I learnt SQL on a similar platform Codecademy and loved it but then I tried opening up SQL server to start my own project and felt like a headless chicken,1
D9bNctNnAig,For advanced level I basically think there is simply nothing you can learn online there are piles of thick books with academic levels out there why bother yourself with online unfiltered cheap infos,0
D9bNctNnAig,I started a month ago got the annual subscription I like the variety of topics they have I feel like its perfect for someone with no prior knowledge and just getting familiar with programming I complement the theory with Coursera,1
D9bNctNnAig,should i do a year,0
D9bNctNnAig,Whats the difference between this and W3 school,0
D9bNctNnAig,Datacamp is terrible Their videos are more like presentations than they are videos that teach a concept or skill Do not waste your time or money You can learn more right here on YT by much better instructors that use superior teaching methods,1
D9bNctNnAig,hello guys if youre in University you can get it free for 3 monthsss,1
D9bNctNnAig,If Im studying cyber security would Datacamp be useful to me,1
D9bNctNnAig,Which elearning platform do you recommend for learning more advanced topics related to data science Is plitalsight a good one,1
D9bNctNnAig,lol,1
D9bNctNnAig,Hi Alex Just a quick question Im trying to switch my career and I felt in love with analytics about seven months ago and Ive took the google data analytics course I bought some books you recommend etc but my question is How many years did you spent by studying all the courses before you apply for the job I ask that not because Im lazy but because Im 35 already and sometimes I think is a bit late for me thanks,1
D9bNctNnAig,Why are python fanboys such snobs R was was built for data science Anyway Ill go watch somebody elses channel now,-1
D9bNctNnAig,which platform would you suggest for advanced users to learn some advanced algorithms and efficient methods to solve any problem thanks,1
D9bNctNnAig,hi there a quick question so how many courses can you take until you are ask to have subscription  thanks,1
D9bNctNnAig,25 a monthbilled annually which is a lot up front If you do monthly its 29 If you want the tier with the projects thatll be 33 a month paid annually or 49 monthly  Its not a cheap service,-1
D9bNctNnAig,I think its important to supplement Datacamp with other resources  Maybe some others like CourseraUdemy for some high level theory  Like you said its great for learning syntax and for beginners who need a lot of spoon feeding  I am learning Python and SQL on this platform right now  After a a short video we jump into these exercises with fillintheblanks without knowing  what server it is using how to upload datasets into the server and sometimes what the goal of a problem is  It takes you to a screen and you just starting filling in the blanks It doesnt reflect real life  Datacamp is valuable for learning technical skills and I really like their user interface but I think newbies need additional resources,1
D9bNctNnAig,I came here wondering if I should pay fro datacamp premium After watching this video I didnt feel informed enough to make decision I did find this video from Jen at The Career Force very helpful,0
D9bNctNnAig,Whats better than datacamp that youd recommend,1

D9bNctNnAig,"Data Camp Udemy and what not are all garbage Its scam 
Theres enough free content available and these courses are mostly completely worthless just open any book or do a quick web search and youre off better than with whatever these garbage platforms offer 
On top of that the certificates are totally worthless as well its just some good boy epoints nobody cares about What kind of smoothbrain employer hires somebody based on some web course anyways",1
D9bNctNnAig,Sir will i be getting a certificate to add into my resume,0
D9bNctNnAig,Would someone recommend one or more of these courses for trading The final aim being to create my own bot thanks,1
D9bNctNnAig,DataCamp is 100 useless DO NOT USE IT,-1
D9bNctNnAig,Does datacamp offer free certificate once we complete the course,1
D9bNctNnAig,Anyone interested in DataCamp towards the end of the year they offer an annual subscription for 150,1
D9bNctNnAig,My biggest problem with Data Camp is that they just throw information and code at you Its almost overkill The fact that you get almost no practice writing the code yourself makes it worse The way they deliver course content is extremely repetitive and I honestly dont remember a lot after 810 months of using it The best way to learn is to experiment yourself And if you want to remain sane during your learning journey just select one resource and stick to it,1
D9bNctNnAig,What do you think is the best option to learn python from beginner to pro,1
D9bNctNnAig,Coding with Mosh is awesome,1
D9bNctNnAig,Hi Alex Great video I would like to know what is your opinion about DataCamps Data Scientist Track Do you believe that it is suitable to pursue a Data Science career,1
D9bNctNnAig,Suppose one wants to do data analyst with python  one has zero knowledge in noth data science  Python programming is this a good place to start,1
D9bNctNnAig,I really love how you gives us honest feedbacks on these platforms Because of that you just got one additional subscriber Keep it up,1

D9bNctNnAig,andrew ng sentdexjermy howardmit course thats it you can do all most everthing with that,1
D9bNctNnAig,I have subscribed for second year for Datacamp and actually got the cheaper deal with approx 125 per month I think this is a steal even if its just for syntax learning But after one year I think the best part is really the interactivity for me Few videos and then exercise and from scratch so you are building on top of already learned skills As youve said probably best for beginners not for advanced people For me its great and for some time it still will be,1
D9bNctNnAig,Hi Alex was wondering from coursera certificate which one do you think is best the google one or the IBM,1
D9bNctNnAig,So grateful for your content I have just started looking at Data Analytics and was quite confused on which are the good ones,1
D9bNctNnAig,my university just provided me with 6 months datacamp plan i guess its the best time to become data analyst lol,1
D9bNctNnAig,You dont lose points by getting it wrong just by asking for hints or giving up Thats actually quite clever and based gamification Look for Mark Robers talk on the Super Mario effect,0

VsztBAEtC7c,Hi Alex I have a request Would you make a video explaining why is necessary or advantageous to use Python for visualizations instead of using  Tableau or Power BI In my opinion is much easier Power BI or Excel to do charts so there must be a clear advantage to use Python for particular reasons,1
VsztBAEtC7c,Lets say that Im Micheal Scott from the Office and I have absolutely no idea about python not even even basics basic Will it help me to learn it from the scratch as Ive no computer science experience nor IT ex I belong to management background and never had any exposure with any of the programming or coding languages ever,0

T3KMZoXrVTQ,Great video SQL is a MUST,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Im an Excel power user I get to be so creative in Excel that my spreadsheets are scary Lol There is no spreadsheet i cant develop The companies Ive worked for often give me the most powerful laptop on market to work with their data I am selftaught I learned Excel shortly after Windows made its debut YepI was 19 years old At my current age i am even more keen on spreadsheet acrobaticsi cant get enough Going to go ahead and get serious about SQL and Python so i can be selfemployed before retirement age By the time i retire Id like to have a firm of data consultants for businesses that dont have the budget to have its own data experts,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Ive gone from basic html to Advanced Excel to learning R  Tableau and SQL SSMS and SQLite Currently exploring Python Power BI MongoDB and Hadoop But there are so many tools and software out there to learn that sometimes it feels overwhelming even as a data analyst Also no one organization uses the same tool so targeting your dream company and learning what they use can be a great challenge,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hi alex heres my question Do you think having the said skills experience youre already employable into data analyst world,0
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I currently work in finance as an analyst using only base excel I decided to take a Data Analytics bootcamp from Fullstack Academy this way I can learn SQL more advanced Excel Python Tableu and AWS The way the market is going these are fundamental skills IMO they should be taught as a final year course in college Theyve become so necessary,0

I am a beginner to get on this path",1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I work extensively with SQL Excel and Tableau at work I really enjoy working with data but management seems to underestimate the work involved in analyzing data It seems like Im valued less than everyone else Im just the guy that builds reports  I hear this is pretty common Any other analysts here struggle with this,0
T3KMZoXrVTQ,You dont need to write too much sql Tools like MS SQL Server or MySQL have visual query builders which will write sql for you For more complex analysis you can always export your query to excel or PowerBI,0
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hi Alex very good video and it motives me a lot I think you could add that the data analyst need held some pressure because he use to work with a lot of people and sometimes directly with big boss I think the job is not just hard skills as Python SQL etc Its as well how to manage people organize his work  etc,1

T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey Alex Great video thanks a lot Part of my job is to collect data from all those different partners to prepare daily reports for performance analysis DWBI  Each of them has different dashboards which you need to login first different structure and different steps to retrieve the data its mainly in xslx or csv format More importantly you can only download it via browser So my question is which tool can help me to collect all these data automatically Can python help me with automating this process and have a uniform structure before adding to excelpower bi

Final note I would love to see a video frok you explaining APIs",1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hi Alex firstly Id like to express my gratitude for sharing your knowledge and  helping others in your channel Then with the vast range of online resources what is you evaluation for 365  DS platform Is it worth the cost,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Yes Totally agree with all the tools and programming languages you mentioned  Cloud computing is becoming equally important for data analysts these days and will become a must skill to have for data analysts,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I am learning Excel and python most nowdays This video motivate me alot,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Alex please make a separate video for Cloud platform in Data Analytics,0
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I remember going going from learning Excel to Tableau to SQL and now Python  Biggest change honestly so far was Excel to SQL for handling data  Holy I thought I was a boss with Power Query and then SQL said hold my semicolon,0
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Awesome,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex Great video as always

I am curios to know which IDE do use for data analysis in python

T3KMZoXrVTQ,Im working on python right now programming is my biggest weakness im improving it,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,How do u recommend learning cloud platforms Not sure if its in the course video you have,-1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I think you should consider R if you are going to learn selective packages in R then the learning curve is not that much Also the Rmarkdown is a fabulous notebook which lets you write RPythonSQLbash all under one roof You should give it a try,1
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey so I have recently started learning how to use the pandas module of Python and was just wondering what the main use for it usually is At the moment I spend most of my time just being able to deal with most typical user requests using power query and connecting to SQL databases in order to create refreshable spreadsheets or Power BI reports So yeah what things would I typically find myself doing in Python that would be unreasonable for Power Query  Excel  Power BI

The main things I know of are machine learning NLP and some statistical functions but I just want to know some more other practical use cases of Python hope that makes sense",1

tJaDicmRW7s,I know Im commenting on this a year later but you were wrong about the travel industry specifically regarding short term rentals like Airbnb and VRBO What happened in regards to travel was people were flying less which means destination vacations like Hawaii or flying across the country were showing a major slow down Instead people started looking for great areas that they could drive to and at a reasonable distance Drive to destinations like The Smoky Mountains in Tennessee Destin Florida and Miramar beach and Joshua Tree absolutely exploded Owners of rentals were seeing the highest rates theyve ever been able to charge because people just wanted to get away and a lot of the travelers were using their COVID checks to pay for these vacations That and the increase in remote work allowed people to work and also visit a place theyve never been to before Just an observation and as always I love the content and you have inspired me to change my career trajectory to Data Analytics Once I get a job Ill donate 14 of my first paycheck to you as a massive thank you for the free content you have provided,0

tJaDicmRW7s,Analyzing statistics in a dataset is like slowly peeling back layers of an onion if you think about it The more layers of the proverbial onion that you peel back ie the deeper you dive into the data and differentiate between correlation and causation the closer you get to understanding the key factors that drive certain trends in the industry you are analyzing,0

tJaDicmRW7s,"I think a good video would be how to turn a human question into a specific question for your analysis and how break big analysis problems into smaller steps and think computationallymay be a little heady but I think walking through that process with someone who is experienced would be super helpful

Or a video on how you think about how you decide on a visualization and what to include in it  or how you prepare a presentation As Ive been working with tableau the amount of choices can be overwhelming

 Also maybe a mock data analyst interview video lol where it feels like Im on video call being interviewed so I can practice answering questions",1

hfRcaRw_atI,Another tip I would include is Confidence comes with experience While there will always some level of anxiety related to doing a job interview youll find its greatly reduced if you have experience in the domain tools and technology associated with the role This doesnt have to be exclusively work experience It can be hours of SQL practice or several projects using Python Employers are looking for people that can help them get work done And if you have a lot of work you got done you can come in with confidence that you will be someone of value to the company Do not neglect this part Get in the practice on tools and tech you will use finish projects in the domain and industry you want to work in and shamelessly post about it somewhere Build confidence,1

Just to add on maybe one more point could be to know your resume in and out The last thing youd want is the interviewer to ask So why dont you tell me about xyz thing that youve written on your resume and youve completely forgotten about that project or whatever the interviewer is asking for and end up giving some vague answer It just leaves a bad impression",-1

hfRcaRw_atI,What has worked really well for me in the past is asking about the background of the interviewer It seems like a weird question but it can be a really nice change of pace for a recruiter and it can be very helpful information if a potential future colleague is interviewing you One time a recruiter went off on a full tangent and afterwards said they enjoyed a lovely conversation what followed was him constantly going the extra mile for me and landing a pretty awesome position in 3 weeks or so,1

Your videos are very helpful to beginners such as me I tried the last question the highest salary with cte like you did and I also tried subquery but I got a little bit confused about it
select

    eName as Employee
    Salary
from Employee e
join Department d
on edepartmentiddid
where eDepartmentIdsalary in
select DepartmentIdmaxsalary from employee group by DepartmentId

This answer is accepted but why does it go wrong if e is added to the DepartmentId like eDepartmentId  in the last line
It seems that they dont have too much difference

ru0Xdvxd37Q,Is there a reason why you didnt mention entry level,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Alex youre great Very informative content Im currently an entry level Bus Ops Analyst for a fortune 500 and am dealing with big data and automating reports using Tableau Prep Ive come to like this a lot and am thinking of either making a career change to Data Analyst or trying to grow quicker within my role by learning skills like Python What are your thoughts,1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Will an MBA with a specialization in data analytics help or just a related MSc,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,they sure are taking their time with the google analytics program on coursera,1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I have a masters degree in Data Science and worked as a student in a companyresearch for 25 years Of course jobs were Data Science related Id say Im on an upper mid level What do you think,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I transitioned to a data analytics role in my company  Im 9 months into a 1 year rotation through 4 departments  
A few things come to mind
1  Somewhere in that middle to senior level one probably needs to think about getting some statistics skills maybe even could be the right masters program for this field
2  I am concerned that a lot of the analytics roles that are so plentiful will be eliminated by the development of machine learning and the more advanced technological development of the programs such as BI and Tableau  The field may end up over the next few years becoming a hybrid of data analytics data science data engineering  
4  I think a lot of folks also should consider advancing in a particular domain after they reach mid level analyticsdata analysis  Leaders in marketing sales risk ecetra all will be folks with these base data skills in the future",0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I m from india  really loves your such advice  Please suggest me that I have to join an institution or any online course for the data analyst course,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,This is very helpful as Im planning what skills I need to improve on and gain in order to move up  Thanks for another great vid,1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hey Alex
Great content as usual
I have a very big disadvantage compare to other candidates which is I only have an associate degree from a community college
This is one thing that scared me the most
Cause almost 100 percent of jobs require at least a bachelors degree
Can you share your thought about it
Thank you",0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Thank you this was really helpful Sadly all of the entry level data analyst jobs Ive been seeing having high expectations and require a strong technical background,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hey Alex Have been binging on some of your content for a while now And largely it has been quite informative  even the A Day in the Life Of video For this one you asserted that an entrylevel Data Analyst role might not require R or Python I have been looking at jobdescriptions in Canada for Data Analyst roles for a while now and I have to say  I have not seen any profiles that do not explicitly need Python and R along with SQL TableauPower BI and MS Excel 

Can you throw some more light on this One caveat is that most of the roles I have seen are related to finance Is the inconsistency because of the domain",1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery is the uncharismatic twin of Parsley,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Ugh celery man,0
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hey there enjoying the content so keep it up Biggest thing I would add is you have only focused on the technical skills here and not the other aspects that come into data analytics From a technical standpoint I personally do not think there is much of a difference between Mid level and Senior level slight improvements yes but the biggest technical difference is between junior and mid level 

However from a problem solving there is a big difference eg junior analyst you produce the data which is ask of you mid level you think more about what they are asking and find ways to add additional value or highlight opportunities you have notices Senior level you are comfortable going back to a CEO or head of department level figure and asking is this really what you want because half the time they are not asking the question they really want solved 

Final thing I would add is you skill of communicating the data you may be able to produce the most accurate model but if you cannot communicate the findings it will likely be forgotten",1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Dude celery is an underrated veggie It doesnt have to be the a favorite veggie but its solid and can be a filler  Its really good if you put it in a smoothie and mix with something naturally sweet like apples and bananas 
And yes its only segment I forward to when watching your videos  All this talk about entry level and senior level data analyst doesnt sound fun  
Seriously thanks for another informal video about the different levels of a data analyst Much appreciated",1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"What are your thoughts on learning Excel VBA
Should I bother learning Python or R instead first
I appreciate your celery story",1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Hi Alex I am following your fantastic videos Thank you for them I have some questions but prefer to ask them by email or something like that we can do that Thank you,1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery can be a very good weapon my ex used it alot but I prefer to eat it raw Thanks for sharing Alex,1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery   is disgusting,-1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Does it matter what field your masters degree is in or is it just more important that you have a masters,1
ru0Xdvxd37Q,OMG many thanks for everything you did and doing for us I never think that my last name is so hard and i enjoyed how you pronounce it i repeated many times but i think it pronounce like bushusha I hope you got increased in your celery,1

BAVPAYWAoC4,"Thank you for this video Before watching this I had a call asking me about my understanding of the data analyst and data engineer role I knew nothing about the data engineer role and the hiring company was mostly concerned about how good I am at SQL and Python Since I was still trying to get my feet wet through an entry level data analyst job I am still learning Python through online videos I was surprised that they only had a data engineer position available and did not mind that I had a commerce degree instead of the a datastatisticsmath related one

After watching this video Im pretty sure as someone who has only gone through courses related to data analysis data engineers are definitely require a whole lot more training before they can get hired relative to a data analyst",1
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I love your videos and description
However weather I was an Analyst and Engineer I have never ever got asked about my degree during an interview Just fyi I have a GED",1

BAVPAYWAoC4,Hey Alex just starting following your channel today and Ive enjoying your videos a lot Im graduating from my Bachelors in Physics in June and I like programming a lot I have learnt for the past 3 years I also found myself archiving very good results when working with data and treating it Im looking for a job before I move on with a higher degree and I find myself between Software Development and Data Analytics My fear is that working in Data Analytics I start to lose my developer side that I like so much Anyways what job would you say that it would be a good marriage between my scientist side and my developer side Thank you and Im sorry if this question is too specific D,1
BAVPAYWAoC4,Hey Alex hope your well I am currently an undergrad HEALTH information management student and will graduate in a couple of months Interested in become a healthcare data analyst I know I have to lear SQL r studio python and sort but do I need to know a lot of math No very good at that Thank you,0
BAVPAYWAoC4,A Clear and Neat presentation,0
BAVPAYWAoC4,"In my understanding Data engineer is more like a software engineer focusing on database It requires many technical skills In term of number of jobs available data engineering outweighs over data scientist and data analyst and also pays better It s easier to transfer to a software engineer 

I have no interest in data engineering but if data engineering is a better option I might need to consider that",1
BAVPAYWAoC4,I always thought that the engineer also cleanses the data,0
BAVPAYWAoC4,Great info thanks and Merry Christmas,1

BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hey Alex thank you for your content Currently Im looking into switching careers and start in a wider field with more opportunities I was introduced by somebody a Data Scientist boot camp  I would like to know your thoughts about this is this worth it  I do not have any experience in SQL phyton or in any of this field  however Im a quick learner  

I  have experience collecting data as past jobs in a junior engineer position  but not too much experience I have seen job postings for data analysts and data scientist that they requieres specific engineerings What are the odds of getting a job after doing a high intensive boot camp of 4 months  Thank you",1
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I am a little confused What I understand and know is that a Data Analysts work can shapedetermine the future of a company by finding trends and predicting behavior So then why does a Data Engineer earn more

BAVPAYWAoC4,Hey Alex Awesome video Do you know of any updates on the Google Career Certificate Data Analyst Track Any info would be appreciated,1
BAVPAYWAoC4,Im currently finishing up a data analyst track but after watching this video Im more curious about data engineering Is there a minimum I can learn in data engineering in Python and Azure in particular as an aspiring analyst that can make me fit for a minor role as an engineer and is that practical more lucrative for me andor more attractive to prospective employers Love this channel btw you have been a HUGE help for someone like me with NO previous technical ability,1

BAVPAYWAoC4,is this a repost,0
BAVPAYWAoC4,Before this video even starts I want to thank you for making it Ive been following your channel and found it really informative but then learned about data engineering as a career path and feel it would suit me much better and have been desperately looking for more resources about it I already work with data and have been trying to pick up the right skills to go for data analyst positions but now want to pursue data engineering Im just trying to figure out how So thank you and I would love if you could explore this area further,1

I continued asking people especially since I was an independent contractor working the same position as people who worked directly for the facility 

Usually people would tell me their rates and I would tell them my rate through the agency 

I recently got hired by one of the facilities out of desperation my license expired and Im in the process of renewing it and since I asked everybody their pay before I got on board I know that Im making more than anybody there except one person who has her masters and surprisingly nobody asked me how much I make I think they just assume I took the same rate as them

whgwEwA5SHU,I agree that you should be able to ask this This can backfire sometimes unfortunately though I was about to move to another company once and then my current company offered me 2 more per hour I didnt feel the need to hide that information from my 3 coworkers and if I didnt go into details on why Im staying instead of going to the other place I was excited to go to then it would seem suspicious My current manager got on my case a week later because during our raise evaluation my coworkers asked for more because of the offer they gave me The 2 increase actually brought me up to my coworker whod been there a few years longer and she was upset about it,0
whgwEwA5SHU,"Meatstuffed tomatoes with cheese on top and baked in the oven are the best Take some tomatoes preferably bigish and cut off the tops Scoop the centre out with a spoon and fill it with grounded meat or grounded meat mixed with rice as I do then cover with some grated cheese on top Ideally your meat should be up to around the tomatos top and the cheese somewhat over it so everything bakes nicely and the tomato doesnt get too dry Then stuff it into a preheated oven and cook until all looks good to eat Will probably take around 20 minutes depending on the ovens temperature and how big the tomatoes are

And the recipe can be adjusted however you want  take bigger tomatoes if you want to put more meat inside or cover with a lot of cheese if thats your thing or have a lot of small tomatoes if youre mostly in it for the veggies Very juicy very tasty and very easy to make",1

I will say though in my opinion what other people are making is virtually irrelevant to what youre making Other people making more than you is not really a good argument for why you should make more It doesnt really say anything about your skills and contributions per se YMMV

whgwEwA5SHU,Thats exactly what I do I ask my coworker who are closer to me I wonder how do they calculate a promotion salary maybe the average between all the people in that position  also depending in your education background work experience  everytime I get a promotion I do a research on glassdoor salarycom and others to see if I am getting paid fairly,1

whgwEwA5SHU,"I wish more people understood that Discussing your salary with your coworkers only helps the both of you to make sure the company doesnt underpay you 

Most Companies dont want employees discussing their salaries with each other because it enables the company to pay people who are doing the same work differently Many times newer people get paid more because it cost more to hire someone away from another company their skills could be better etc 

Many people may think that if they do above average work that their salary is probably more than their peers and dont want to share their salary to avoid jealousy or whatever other reason but most of the time companies are trying to pay you the least they can for the maximum amount of high quality work they can squeeze out of you 

One argument Ive heard is that High Performers shouldnt share their salary because the company may pay them more than their peers doing the same job and them sharing their salary could cause conflict in the workplace maybe even make management unhappy with them 

However In my experience too many people think theyre high performers when theyre not We always tend to think the best of ourself and are more critical about other people than we are for ourselves 

In some cases high performers do get paid more but they have to truly bring significant Value to the company By value i mean they increase productivity cut significant costs or increase revenue significantly",1
whgwEwA5SHU,"The new intro and outro are impressive

K1WeoKxLZ5o,This is finally the hello world app from which I can understand CTEs,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you Alex for creating such helpful seriesmore power to you,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,This would be more helpful with a few use cases bc it looks like theres no point to this when temp tables exist right When would CTEs be better than temp tables,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Im not sure to understand why would we use CTE over a sub query,-1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,My cte employee is showing error object invalid what does it means,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,did you really just copy and paste the whole thing from another video how is this an Advanced tutorial if you dont show all the steps,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,so its like a function right,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Can you use the CTE to do joins or unions before your actual end query,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,You are very loyal  I really respect u because you give us a chance to love our dreams to become a data analyst,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you for this,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,OMG Thank you SO very much for this simple tutorial You are the only person who said take your existing code and simply encase it all into the WITH clause and then SELECT  the clause I had spent hours chasing deadends until I stumbled onto your tutorial Many MANY thanks,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I just did this in DataCamp and although I completed the exercise OK I felt that I didnt really get it Now I feel that I do,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Two years ago but still educative I appreciate you Alex,0

K1WeoKxLZ5o,I know this a bit old but I cannot wrap my head around a use case for these  Im sure it will come to me eventually lol  Wonderful series  Ive been really intimidated by a couple of these concepts up until now,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I keep taking courses on coursera and datacamp and I understand nothing and every time I end up understanding concepts from your videos you are amazing keep it up,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Great video Do you find that performance is better on a CTE or a temp table Lets say my underlining dataset is 6 million rows If I wanted to do the heavy lifting and break it down to a more manageable size to then query off of would a CTE or a temp table be better

Thanks",1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,As an enterprise data analyst I use CTEs subqueries and temp tables regularly  However I have never really looked into the benefits from a performance perspective of using one over the other  It would be an interesting video I think,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,What does this mean    OVER PARTITION by Gender,-1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Expected this to be complicated Grateful Alex that youve simplified a seemingly complex query THX,-1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Here to mark todays attendance,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Hey Alex Im sorry Im confused Is this the first in the Advanced SQL Tutorial set It seems to suggest I should be mastering the TEMP TABLES and the SUBQUERIES,0

K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thanks,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Could help to explain in what scenario we could use CTE When we face,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,The way you explain open my mind than reading from the website elsewhere very easy to understand thanks,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,A315 what does it mean its gonna work only after the direct CTE I have made,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Anyone know which video hes referencing where he built that query that was added into the WITH statement Curious about the OVER  PARTITION by statement,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,You explained this very well and simply Great demo thanks,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you for a great example and lesson Still a bit confused about how aggregate functions are used without a groupby clause,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"so using Temporary Table is more powerful than CTE because it still stored during the session right
is there any benefits for using CTE over temp Table",1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thanks for your hard work Alex,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I cant thank you more Alex,1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Did he add Toby I dont have him in results when i run my query,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,This is so dope thank you,0
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I find this is a very poor tutorial compared with the other two CTE videos I just watched  Those show simple examples of how CTEs can be used to solve everyday querying tasks  This video has none of that,-1
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I have a very basic question why not create different tables Why would CTE have an advantage,0

AVGSalary OVER PARTITION BY CompanyDepartment

First look at the PARTITION BY CompanyDepartment This means to find all the possible groups in that column CompanyDepartment So lets say that all the possible groups are Sales Department Marketing Department and Engineering Department 

Now take a look at the AVGSalary This means that for each group which we found above find the AVGSalary for that group For this example this means that for the Sales Department find the AVGSalary for that department And same for the Marketing Department and Engineering Department

This is my thought process for how to think of PARTITION BY but everyone has their own thought process so if your way works then it works

I hope this helps",1

D6XNlTfglW4,"This makes sense so partition by just allows us see everything spread out instead of the GROUP By
Question will we still need to use HAVING Instead of WHERE  

Im just asking this to help other viewers curiosity lol",1

D6XNlTfglW4,I stumbled across your videos and I must say that they are the best  I like the chunking  You have the voice tone volume etc that makes it comfortable to listen to  I finally got to topics that were hard for me to understand but you break it down so eloquently  Thanks you for what you have and are doing  I want to better develop my skills as a Data Analyst and you are assisting in that,1

D6XNlTfglW4,If I wanted to do the same gender count but with a filter just say salary with an amount greater than X how do I get the count to show the filtered results and not the pre filter result,1
D6XNlTfglW4,Hey Alex I love it Glad to see that you used The Office TV Series cast names,1
D6XNlTfglW4,"See Partition by would have been REALLY great to know when I was trying to get a total sum of a given inventory item that was broken down by lots in a location For example Item 123 could have lot a lot b and lot c in 1 location there might be 2 in one lot 3 in another and 5 in another  My solution was to subquery the Sum all items in a location then Inner join that sum and join on the Item Location as that will always be unique so instead of having a really large query this partition by would have shrunk the query down to an easy to read Look here is the items their locations and total sum of all the lots in each location 

Well better late than never",1
D6XNlTfglW4,Thanks Alex,1
D6XNlTfglW4,oh man this is a very good explanation,1
D6XNlTfglW4,You never broke down the partition by syntax,-1

D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you Sir All Good to you,1
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thank you Alex This is the best explanation of GROUP BY statement for me The GROUP BY statement is going to reduce the number of rows in our output by actually rolling them up and then calculating the sums or averages for each group
You make things so easy to understand",1

D6XNlTfglW4,Unless posted elsewhere might be a decent idea to show more about window functions and how you can even use it things like having rolling counter or much more IMO,1
D6XNlTfglW4,"I tried this but by partitioning by a column with an aggregate function SUM invoicetotal  It didnt work as expected 
SELECT suppidxinvInvoiceTotal 
	  SUMinvInvoiceTotal OVER PARTITION BY invInvoiceTotal AS GrandTotalsBySupplier
  FROM INVOICES order by suppidx

Yielded sample output crazy data
suppidx	invInvoiceTotal	GrandTotalsBySupplier
158			41256				165024
158			41256				165024
158			41264				41264

158			40469				80938
158			40350				363150
158			40350				363150

I expected to see the third column all have the value of
12295685141

When I did it by the COUNT it showed the correct count
  SELECT suppidxinvInvoiceTotal 
	  COUNTsuppidx OVER PARTITION BY suppidx AS TotalInvoicesBySupplier
  FROM INVOICES order by suppidx

suppidx	invInvoiceTotal	TotalInvoicesBySupplier
158			11164				74606
158			19266				74606
158			5478				74606
158			2850				74606
158			59090				74606
158			4683				74606
158			877932				74606
158			215205				74606
158			732721				74606

SELECT COUNT FROM INVOICES WHERE suppidx  158
 output  74606

Why does one aggregate function work and the other not
I followed the advice to remove the order by but it appears to be doing a running total",-1

yzqpYs7dIqY,"I think hiring staff at companies would be better off if they saw one particular scene from the movie A Beautiful Mind It was about famous Mathematician John Nash

There was a scene where Nash and his college buddies were at a bar and there were several women But there was 1 blonde lady there that they all were drooling over Nash pointed out that if they ALL went for her they would all lose And then if they followed that up by going after her friends they would give them the cold shoulder for being the second option But if they sacrificed getting the best option to get the good enough option they would all have an equal chance at going home with a woman

The moral of the story is this bring your expectations down to reality Maybe dont shoot for the top 5 or 10 Try shooting for the top 35 If necessary get more people to look over your online application submissions in order to properly assess what talent you have Plus corporate America already has a pretty bad stink of treating the people behind the applications and their employees as numbers rather than people

And if corpo america doesnt want thatmaybe just hire whoever they can find locally Have your employees do prebono work to find your applicants at local universities Pester the students to apply Go back to printing ads in the paper or something like that",1

Courses Im currently doing and waiting to get certification and progressing sequentially from 1  3

1Google Data Analytics Certificate  SQL and Tableau 
2Tableau Data Analyst Certification  Tableau
3Microsoft Certified Data Analyst Associate PowerBI

Would the IBM Data Engineering Certificate be too much What do you think

Im currently trying to transition into a Data Analyst role I have a Masters allready in a field called Econometrics  6 years experience in Economics Research

as someone who just finished Udemys SQL Bootcamp and is on her way to become a data analyst within the music industry I would like to thank you for this video I plan to just apply to my first Data Analyst position and all the job postings started to freak me out You managed to ease some of my anxiety in this regard 

Im going to be yet again a bringer of weird taste combinations instead of coffee I would recommend to bring in chocolatebeets  cookies to the show This is the closest recipe I could find to the original Hungarian version  
They are amazingly tasty and way healthier in the middle of the night than coffee  I hope youll give them a try",1
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Here are my two cents on this this entire situation is completely ridicules and I think companies and HR specifically is going to create a nightmare of scenario in 1  2 years time because they will need to rehire so many people and fast and it will cost a lot of money to the companies  People who are senior and have no other choice but to take these positions will be unhappy They will feel that their were screwed over by companies who took advantage of the pandemic and in turn will be the first to jump ship when the recovery will start I assume recovery specifically in the Data Analytics world will have a lot of demand as companies will need to process insane amount of data and fast So instead of having a junior employee that will be with his natural career progression for about 2  4 years employers will get unhappy staff that will change jobs in a heart beat for more money again I assume would be around 6  12 months for good senior analysts I backup my assumption by vaccines success rate and overall stock exchange recovery

Just stumbled upon your channel a few weeks back and am currently binging the videos while working Say would you consider Alteryx to be a nocode analytics tool Because it seems to kind of fit the description and for one thing I can tell that some bigname audit companies do use it to allow not very techsavvy employees to handle clients data including fairly big data The datas often pretty clean not always sometimes its quite a hassle but theres still a lot of ETL going on and even rather complex workflows are built in Alteryx before potentially being handed over to a more advanced analyticsdevelopment team if needed

Can be quite useful when preparing data on rudabega sales for further analysis",1

GGLF2jLo8J4,"Can you tell me if these traitspersonality qualities make Data Analyst a good or bad match For those interested this is theoretical mumbo jumbo of MBTIs INFJ personality type IEI and TePolR are in reference to me

IEI I make lots of little factual errors dont focus on the little details unless absolutely forced to I dont care about doing things the best way unless its something I really care about If its something I really care about I will slave over it not Tepolr related just explaining and be meticulous and obsessive and perfectionist If its something I dont care about I will literally do a way that takes longer and wastes time and doesnt do the job as well just for the sake of not having to focus on it I am so indifferent to optimization thats a Te buzzword

TePoLR have trouble dealing with things in a detached and rational manner They have trouble focusing on work and tend to have trouble doing things the way things are supposed to be done often doing things in a way that is most emotionally stimulating which can be perceived as wasteful of time or resources They fear that they wont meet objective expectations or that they will be forced to do so

Tepolr have problems trusting information theyre given They are unlikely to trust unreliable sources of information and make a determination based on anything but personal experience or vision Ive found that often IEI like to have some what they feel to be reliable reference material which they will consult when doing something but often have problems doing research outside of that Theyre often quite skeptical of reasonable reliable sources of information that some people find ok They need someone to explain it to them or someone to do it and prove it in front of them then they will have some trust of that information",0

pvxNYyJuiqA,My friend recommended me to learn R instead of Python but I see many places that recommend Python over R Am i right to believe that either language is perfectly suitable and is more likely what you perfer only advantage I am aware of Python is more machine learning friendly which could be very useful but you can do that with R as well,1

pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great insights for an absolute beginner like me Without any knowledge of the first two and little of the third I just started learning Python because of the perception that it will solely land me ajob since it is highly indemand It still is really hard for a nonprogrammer like me to fully grasp the concepts
After watching your videos Im surely going to put Python on hold and start to deeply understand SQL and Tableu 
Thank you for sharing",1
pvxNYyJuiqA,"In addition to the Excel skills mentioned in the video I recommend becoming familiar with Power Query in Excel as well  
I work in an environment where I dont have access to a DBMS or Python so Ive been doing all of my analysis by writing SQL connections in Excel and then using Power Query for cleaning transforming and EDA or pushing these into the SQL queries whenever possible  
Its very intuitive if you already understand SQL and Pandas and you can do some pretty useful analysis with it",1

ySq0cgkZiX4,Is taking classes like these and the ones you mentioned in the video about coursera good for getting an entrylevel data analysis position  Or is it better to have a masters in data analysis or data science or take classes through an accredited program,1

ySq0cgkZiX4,In my company a lot of my internal customers are not python savy  They want all the automation of reports to happen in excel  Some folks may run into that so being really good at excel  including VBA may be worth investigating,1
ySq0cgkZiX4,Good info  I noticed in one of your other videos though that you would not put on linked in or a resume that you took a course on udemy  Would it may be good to start going through comparative classes on coursera or a platform for each of these subjects and put them on your linked in and or resume,1

Also my favourite ice cream is strawberry with strawberry chunks 

I watched until the end because its easier to listen to longer videos when Im doing something like running or driving and I was too busy to stop the video earlier At some point I realized you kept going on purpose and I decided to keep listening I felt you were trying to get rid of me early for some reason and I wasnt going to let you win Hahaha did you reverse psych me Probably Have a good one",1

aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Hi Alex

Just a thought on the DA trainingcourse market

I was wondering why DA trainingcourses are sold as certificates when the costs close and upwards of 6k or 7k seem close to those of full academic degrees diplomas or masters even when provided or coprovided by universities themselves

Is it because employers prefer these certificates over academic degrees

Or they are too short in duration or the content not extensive enough to be considered degrees

Would be grateful for any input or advice as I dont want to commit to spending that is driven mostly by marketing trends as distinct from actual professional need eg obtaining other ways to bolster CV in terms of DA training via other options such as MOOC certifications portfolios etc

Thanks",0

aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Also I like raddishes so I stuck til the end I just dont like the smell of it Good stuff thanks for the video,1
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,So you would agree to take a bachelors or masters in data analytics or scientist over a certification correct I know each one like python rutgers has a 6 months course Would you suggest to take each course separately if so can someone have a possible chance of getting at least 80k a year also dont put that in my resume then and i hate when jobs say experience what about for new graduates they dont have experience yet,-1

It would be really helpful for lot of us Since most of the freshers like me are stuck onto this who are self paced learners we dont know where to exactly apply our knowledge and most important very few companies offers a data analyst jobs to freshers with no projects They need experience So may be doing industry recognized or real time projects might help us",1

XmFhpoS6Etk,Thank you,0
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I cant believe the coincidence 

Last week 10 months after you made this video I spent the whole week talking to my girlfriend about two things 

1 Replacing our meat ingestion with things as eggplant 

2 How afraid I feel because I am at the brink of getting a new job as a Data Analyst and I am transitioning from Civil Engineering so I feel everyone is gonna be better than me

XmFhpoS6Etk,eggplant nothing else ha ha,0
XmFhpoS6Etk,Haha you said it yourself Part of having imposter syndrome is thinking youre the only one who is an impostor So why does it surprise you that more than half of people in the industry feel this way,1

XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you for that episode
Actually I didnt experience that yet But I can imagine that people feel that way Already while being in college I cant take myself seriously thinking if Im succeeding in this it means there must be a hook somewhere

Now Id like to ask you after a few videos watched what is the practical meaning of data analysis what do you actually do and with which purpose

And eggplant is the strangest vegetable name I know",-1
XmFhpoS6Etk,I believe having some level of this syndrome is healthy because it will keep people motivate to learn more to do their job even better It will also make them feel more confident about job they occupy and salary they earn In the mean time having this high percentage of people having the imposter syndrome is partially because there are some bad players in the market There are some recruiting service provider who lies to employers and create fake experiences in candidates resume and some how successfully recruits people in data and IT related jobs I am sure some of you have already hear or even had observation about some of these bad actors,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,This video was exactly what I needed right now I just found your channel and Im excited to watch more of your videos Over the past 3 years an engineer at my small edtech company has helped me make the transition from marketing associate to data analyst And now as the only person on our data team Im looking to make the move to a bigger company to grow my career even further which comes with a lot of imposter syndrome,1

XmFhpoS6Etk,Never feel bad about making comparisons,-1
XmFhpoS6Etk,"This is so motivating for beginners Thank you a lot  

I have completed 50 of my first online course on SQL Analize Data with SQL from CodeAcademyPro 

I wanted to ask you the following 
Although the course is for beginners do you think I would be competent enough to start applying for or even being accepted in data analytics internships 

In the course Im learning about Manipulation Queries Calculating Aggregates Joining Multiple Tables Usage Funnels User Churn First and Last Touch Attribution Models Window Functions 

I also have a bachelors degree in finance altho no internships performed during my uni years so I have somewhat knowledge of statistics 

My problem is that I dont know if this is enough to start applying at the same time I maybe startcomplete other online courses on the other skills I need as could be Tableau Python R etc in which I have 0 knowledge or should I at least get basic knowledge on all of that before stating applying  

What do you think Alex 

Thank you in advance anyways",0
XmFhpoS6Etk,Im in statistics field and most statistics jobs involves consulting for non statisticians Although I will be graduating with masters degree I feel like I have no idea how I will be the educator for others who even can be smarter than me like doctors and scientists especially biostatistics This can apply in any analytics field But how can i gain the confidence as a consultant My bachelor is not quantitative and I feel theres tons of information to learn I got an interview and I felt like what what did they see in me to call me for a job that requires 3 years experience and I have none My imposter is so bad,0

XmFhpoS6Etk,Hey Alex do whats right dont be people pleaser Kudos,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,Thank you for sharing your experience I share a similar experience coming from a nontechnicaldata background The imposter syndrome was one of the biggest challenges I had to overcome when I transitioned from a high schoolteacher to a project officer then to a data analyst in my forties in a country which I had migrated to The transition started because I was seen as being good with Excel which I was not as I was learning everything through Googling and was quite frankly faking it simply to solve a problem and get things done in the most efficient way by reducing manual repetitive data tasks Although I am still using Excel I have since moved on to SAS EG Power BI and Tableau and have learnt SQL and R though I rarely have to use them in my work So without the depth of experience in coding I am feeling like an impostor again But hopefully it will go away one day once the institutions central data team phase out SAS and bring in a data reporting tool which requires some SQL coding  I dont think I got the  thing but I like  in curry and grilled  with miso paste,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,Insightful episode Alex Will have to try out eggplant parm this month Sounds good,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant I have a question I am studying advanced SQL and started subqueries yesterday How did you get a grasp on subqueries I understand that it is a query inside another query and the the inner query runs first but when it comes to examples I get a little stuck and there arent alot of videos online about subqueries Thank You,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,I think I have what is opposite of imposter syndrome which is inferior complexity I could be wrong as to the exact definition but I consistently feel that I may never be good enough to get myself a good job I tend to perceive myself as inferior to many people I developed this when I was in the military I went in at an older age 34 and everyone my age was either an officer or my superior I began to suffer from depression and anxiety from the social isolation and feelings of loneliness and feelings of not being good enough or far enough in life  Now having been three years since I graduated with a masters degree in exercise science I have yet to work a job that takes any sort of skill Most the the jobs I have had the past three years are manual labor and retail jobs requiring nothing more than a highschool diploma I am positive this is contributing to my worsening depression and anxiety along with inferior complexity I now plan to begin an online masters program in analytics or AI and machine learning I may end up doing both I am hoping that by the time I graduate which will be around the age of 47 and having no domain experience I can land my first data analyst job I would hope to inspire other people who are in their mid 40s or older that it can be done even if you have worked none other than lowwage lowskilled jobs Besides my four years in the military the most I have made in one year is around 19k The day I do land a good job Ill make sure to include some eggplant in my dinner I thought Id mention this Things have been so bad as far as finding a job the past three years that back in 2018 I filled out an application and sent a resume to work at McDonalds as a crew member I never heard back I doubt they have any thing related to eggplant on their menu They could come up with the McEggplant burger or salad,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,Thanks I just got my first ever data analyst job in fact I accepted the offer today Im so nervous about it I really needed to hear this I appreciate you and your videos Keep them coming Except eggplants those things are gross,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,I work as a data analyst for a fortune 10 health care organization maybe we work for the same company within a business segment of our company that focuses on behavioral health dataso I am used to working with therapist and psychiatrist so the touchy feely topic feels normal to me I also have an Associates in Business Admin and a BA in Healthcare Admin that I earned while with the company but most of the people on my team are folks with engineering and computer science degrees I sometimes to have TECH impostor syndrome BUT I will say that I know that I have much more knowledge of the healthcare and business side that than my teammates so this is how I reconcile the impostor syndrome myself,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,Love the video,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,If Im honest on my resume and a company hires me The message I receive is they are telling me Im good enough to do the job  I also try to keep my confidence high by continuing to develop my skills  I think a contributing factor to imposter syndrome is the belief that people are better than you or know more which often times isnt the case,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you for speaking about this topic I am going through a similar situation I am looking for a job and I feel I am no good compared to other candidates after facing rejections 
I am not a naturally confident person so I need external validation for my skills as I can get very selfcritical sometimes

XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant gang I dont want to feel good about other people feeling insecure and stressed but knowing that 58 of people out there in the field feel the same way I do when I see an entry level job that asks for 35 years of experience makes me feel better and more confident about just going for it and applying,1
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Did you try the escabeche eggplant

Escabeche Eggplant
Ingredients
 
3 large eggplants about 22 lb
3 tablespoons Himalayan pink salt or regular granny salt
2 cups of white vinegar
1 cup of water
1 cup of Olive oil
12 teaspoon of black pepper
12 tablespoon of Paprika
12 tablespoon of chili flakes
12 tablespoon of oregano
2 bay leaves
1 cup of sunflower oil it may be more or less


Marinated Escabeche Eggplant by Sigrilina  This is a great way to preserve eggplants and to infuse them with flavor
Preparation
Step 1 Peel the eggplant and cut in 38 inch slices
Step 2 Put the eggplant in a bowl and mix thoroughly with the Himalayan pink salt Let it rest for 30 minutes
Step 3 In a pot mix the vinegar with the water set aside
Step 4 Rinse the eggplant slices
Step 5 Cook the eggplant in the vinegarwater mixture for 2 or 3 minutes or until they have acquired the hardness of your liking Check on them often as they tend to be very hard and then to soft quite quickly
Step 6 Drain the eggplant and set aside
Step 7 In a small bowl mix the olive oil with the spices and the bay leaves
Step 8 In a sterilized jar alternate eggplant and the oil mixture Remember to put the bay leaves in between
Step 9 When you are done cover the rest of the jar with sunflower oil until the eggplants are fully covered
Step 10 Before consumption let rest for at least one week in the refrigerator so the eggplants are really infused with the flavor
Step 11 Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks

eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Interesting facts about Cabbage

1 Ancient roots Cabbage has been cultivated for longer than almost any other vegetable on record To be precise more than 6000 years It originated in Shensi Province China sometime around 4000 BC

2 Elixir for Baldness In ancient China roughly 1000 BC scrolls touted cabbage as a magic cureall for bald men Its hard to say if theres any truth in this claim but no one can deny cabbage is chock full of nutrients that promote good health

3 Vitamin C Galore Cabbage contains a high concentration of Vitamin C That means it cuts out toxins in your body preventing skin disease arthritis and rheumatism Go for red cabbage when you have Vitamin C in mind It contains double the content of regular green cabbage",1

Hi Alex this is me again watching todays video Another of my goals besides changing career to data analyst and finding a job on June is to find an English language based job and hopefully emigrating from my country Im thinking of Mexico where I am at the moment the struggle though is that to be able to work in another country there are always a lot of legal things you have to get that I think might not be easy

But at the same time with all this remote work revolution since COVID I have a theory that maybe I can find a remote job in English without the need of work permits etc and just travel while I work Do you think this is a real possibility I think you are not an immigrant so probably dont have a lot of experience working in another countries but do you have any insight or advice on this maybe from the company hiring immigrants position",1

8SolrjsGqzE,"Thanks for sharing your insights Im in my early 50s and 3 years ago stumbled into a Business Intelligence Developer position I love it wish Id known the world of data analytics existed decades ago Now Im faced with the reality that my career has never been linear  Its taken many twists and turns with different skillsets including primarily focused on raising kids for 15 years  

In my current position I am  the most knowledgeable in the company and100 self taught by reading books online courses etc This is meant to boast its actually a somewhat sad reality Its frustrating not having anyone to talk to with more advanced skills than myself to know if Im approaching projects the right way 

I look at postings for other jobs specific to my skillset Power BI and based on my actual experience with the tool I cant even find anything that isnt entry level thats paying anywhere near what Im currently making

Ive been sitting on the fence on whether or not to pursue a masters and frankly this video helped cement the fact I really dont have a choice if I want to advance my career  I cant get in 10 years of experience with the expectation I having an additional 20 years to work",1

Although it might just be because you mentioned health care and I just graduated with a double masters in public policy and public health  I found you because of your tableau tutorials and they were so much better than the college course I took I know you prefer Python but I would love to see you do tutorials in R because that one was been horrendous for me to learn",1

What can I do to further explore
I dont want to write off a possible career that I might love 

From your videos comparing data analyst to business analyst or data scientist I definitely had my suspicions confirmed that data analyst was what I had in mind for what I wanted 

Its the whole build dashboards and create reports thingthats what I think I would love and be good at based on the small exposure Ive had at different times in my job",1

I have always loved analyzing data I retired from the Marine Corps a few years back and have been trying to find my place in a new career I naturally look toward operations management it is my comfort zone I held a position as a Business Analyst as my first role right out of the service and loved the work but I felt something was missing I always used data to help me make decisions but I didnt have the necessary KSAs to take me to the next level so I went back into operations management 

Based on your recommendations in some other videos I started taking classes on Coursera While I have not made it to where I want to be yet I know I will make it there

I will touch bases with you in the future with an update once I make it but I will say this up front

Thank you for being a part of my success

_gP-DH0iZLw,Cant thank you enough for helping shine a light on specific questions that so many of us have regarding the industry As an undergrad graduating in 2022 I have taken an interest in a more data scientist track compared to a data analyst track Since data scientist roles more often than not require masters degrees should someone look to become a data analyst initially and eventually become a data scientist later in their career or would you suggest a different path for someone looking to become a data scientist,1
_gP-DH0iZLw,Number 6 One can live their life to their fullest and enjoy those sports and hobbies that they thought were too risky and would put them out of commission if injured when it comes to work I figure as long as one can type and crutch or wheel their way into meetings then all is good,1

-Inc1be4zSg,Hi Alex I just transfered career focus a year ago and just graduated with my masters in Business Analytics My issue is that I dont have any career experience in the analyst world so I personally feel that my skills are less strong than someone who began as a freshman Do you have any suggestions for someone like me Are there specific job titles or keywords that could give me a leg up Thank you so much,0

-Inc1be4zSg,Informative Lighting audio and camera are crisp Clothing and background dont matter so long as the material is good which it is I think hearing about the other sides perspective is informative and gears up the listener who is seeking advice At moments it seemed like the conversation tailed off track but in this long format it feels more organic than just reading off a script From my studies professors who walk in with bullet points and ensure they covered the bullet points in the 45 minute setting did a way better job teaching than those who came in with a full on script Thanks for mixing it up,1

-Inc1be4zSg,great timing I have an interview today,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Good point on the SQL question,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Option one lie and get the job but have a chance of being fired but gaining work experience and a salary out of it to avoid a job gap your next job will never know because they cant asked why were you fired  Or the second option hand them an honest under qualifying resume where they wont hire you but it shows the world you have gumption and 40 years  later youre a senator    Truth is if an employer believes they need 3 years experience or a college degree to do this medial level job then they deserve to be lied to,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Goody 2 shoes always want u to tell the truth while they still lying to you haha,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,They would never say  Here we treat employees like crap with bs pay They hide it So if they hide some things why should i feel bad about hiding some things,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Nah lie on your resume  was able to get more interviews jobs and connections this way They do not care 9 out of 10 We live in a corrupt dishonest and two faced  broken inflation economy and society You do whatever you can to get out of unemployment and slave wages

With the sheer amount of poverty unemployment cost of living and living in a world where oppprtunity is so bs you should 100 lie to these greedy high expectation applications No one in this day and age has the credentials these companies want I been hired and interviewed about jobs all the time and tell me these requirements are just technicality Everything these days are in serious demand and because of these compqny boomer mentalities they cant train the actual position on the job or help wprk for and pay for the training degree or certification everyone struggles So ya definitely apply regardless because they have no ideaof the struggle I gotten jobs all the time and lied on them to filler their interests You have too World dors not give a fuq anymore and if they do the worse they can do is not accept your application and continue to struggle trying to find someone to fill their void Thanks for the unemployments ridiculous amount of requirements to have a better job to get out of poverty ane your own companys ignorance

People should be sick of these low wage jobs we only ever get hired for and never get out of poverty Its BS",0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I agree with this video These lies can catch youout for technical roles
But lying about skills fir a basic iob at the bottom fkr minumum wage Wich youll learn the job in training Not  bad I mean youngott aearn to live But lying anything for a role above the bottom Would be a no go As its quiet easy you can get found out As any job a above the basic bottom role Will always requier some skill and experience to count on",0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,These corporation lie to us all the time play dirty,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Reasons not to lie
1 You like being unemployed
2 You want other candidates to get the job
3 You actually want to be homeless
4 You enjoy job rejections
5 You like being lied to and manipulated by companies and feel you shouldnt do the sameya know like fair is fair isnt applicable",1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I havent worked in 14 years and my resume is completely empty Every detail besides my name is a lie,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Dont lie in the resume lie in the interview,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,If you havent found this gem yet this lady shows you how to lie on your resume the right way,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Im at a point where Ive applied to like hundreds of jobs and im not even getting a call back Soooo,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,it feels impossible to get a good position and not lie i for one have told the truth but it seems that i am not viable to be hired for anything beyond customer service,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Never lie about being able to play an instrument My friend put on his CV that he could play the piano Then some time later his boss asked if he could play for the board of directors He was googling how to break his fingers but at the end he confessed to the lie,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Saying not to lie on a resume or not too grossly exaggerate is absurd when the rules of the game as established by employers themselves require that you lie In case anyone hasnt noticed entry level jobs no longer exist By that I mean every job listed as entrylevel now requires 2  years of experience In effect what this means is what I previously said entry level jobs no longer exist Thus unless you fabricate something very cleverly or exaggerated to the ultimate degree how does one without the requisite experience gain employment Employers have no right to expect a hundred percent veracity from prospective employees when the rules of the game as established by the employers themselves demand that you not be truthful in order to gain employment Bottom line is if you tell people to lie to you dont be surprised or angered when they do,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"You define embellishing like I define lying Saying you have three years of experience when you have one seems like it would be classified as a lie 

And I would definitely lie Theyre looking for anything to get you out of the pool so they can refined the talent search That is what happens when you have multiple people applying for the same position so I can get where they are coming from but it means as an employee you do what you have to do to get noticed 

I have been stuck in a career change due to it being a career change and me lacking experience even though I have an advanced degree in the topic Its been very difficult for me to find jobs to get experience in order to have the experience to get the job And I cant do an unpaid internship with three other people depending on me 

So heck yeah I would lie because the people making the hiring decisions dont know what they want or need half the time anyway Just look over the job description and see if you think you can do the job

As another commenter mentioned I would not lie about key skills for the job",0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I got fired for saying the truth about my references,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Whats really stupid is when they ask for personal references,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Terrible advice I always lie on my resume,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,024 No lying is lying Its funny how people say you shouldnt lie while they themselves embellish or just exaggerate the truth Its pure cognitive dissonance,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Joshua Flukes excellent video would be a good rebuttal to this,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Corporate Simp,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Im dont support lying But lets be real Are companies fully transparent with job candidates Then whey do we have to be Fully Transparent with them,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,With hiring managers being so stupid and short sighted  everyone might as well lie,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,downside of lying on your resume  you will not be hired for job which you will not be hired for if you wouldnt lie on your resume doesnt look too down for me actually seems the exact same depth,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,about ruining reputation  wasnt there a precedent when ruining reputation costed a lot to ruiner isnt it exact reason why companies dont provide details other than employment dates and position on exemployees,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I had somebody who came  so at least this somebody had a chance  wouldnt he lie he would not even come to have been had by you,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thats why nowadays its a lot harder to lie because they can contact all your references in a second and dig deeper into your history such as a background check to see if you were a criminal or not In those days before the advancement of computers there were probably a lot more people that lied on their resumes because employers would not have the time to find out It used to be a time consuming process Now it only takes less than ten minutes to find out about the candidates and they can get about their day,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Ive been a dancer for 5 years its straight sales The only way I can think of putting that on a resume for previous experience is lying and saying i was in sales but use a different job name I know I would kill it in sales,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Fake it till you make it,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I have an almost 2 year unemployment gap because of personal issues that I wont get into on my resume But I presented it as it is During interviews Ive got asked a lot of questions about it And Ive got turned away from probably 20 companies because of it But eventually I got hired by a well known automation company as a data analyst because I have work experience in automation and because Ive learned the basic data analyst technical skillsSQL Oracle database And now I can work without the anxiety of lying Thanks Alex,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I lied in my resume and tomorrow is my final interview Soo scary,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Im 10 seconds in BETA,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"If you lie on your resume they might let you go
If you do your job they might also let you go",0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"You should lie on your CV UK  at the end of the day when someone is finally given the job  depending what it is but a lot of times what they want you to say at an interview can be completely different to what they want you to do on the job For example on the interview the employer would say things like we are here for you when you have tough family matters safety is everything respect is everything equality is everything etc etc you get the point You get the job arrive at the place explain to everyone youre new and within minutes a hand ful of those employees have gone against what you was told on the interviewapplication Apprentices for example  some of them go through a tough process to get the apprentice and when they are on the job they are treat like piece of shit on a shoe being victimised by initiation pranks and just being the mental and physical punch bag for all the other workers So why cant we lie on CVs when most advertised jobs are also based off lies Whats worse than your colleagues treating you like a retarded puppy at your new job your actual bosses and supervisors getting in on the joke too

So for those reasons  I would say go ahead to anyone wanting to put on the odd lie on their CV unless its for a career sort of job like becoming a doctor cop etcbecause then you are completely screwed But applying for a job at some factory or whatevergo ahead and lie to get you that place chances are most did in the first place",0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I say lie on your resume

Unfortunately hiring managers love to play these gatekeeper roles and they do a fantastic job at it In fact they do such a good job at it that the United States who used to be the epicenter of manufactured goods is now reduced to a consumers market with its World Reserve status on the rocks See lying is something they had to do themselves to get where they are todaybut then those same people expect their prospects to be honest

As far as reputation goes if they try to ruin your reputation if anything it sheds a light on their character that they dont want shining on them and it may even introduce lawsuits Personally in the industry I represent IT I havent heard of an employee getting ousted for lying on a resume and they have no business doing so The best case scenario of just getting fired is actually the common method of handling a liar at least in the industry Im in

Now when it comes to something where human lives are involved such as driving a plane or surgeries I agree you shouldnt lie during those times Any other case I say go for it Once again they can lie to you in your face and yet they expect honesty from you They can lie to you about compensation actual responsibilities your benefits your hours and potential for career advancement within the organization They can even lie to you about your longevity within that organization Ive seen personal horror stories where people get let go after sinking years into a particular company simply because their services were no longer needed No justification No closure Ive even seen people complete a project and get laid off immediately after without disclosing that the position was temporary

TLDR Lie They get to lie to you and they often will so its only fair if you do the same",1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,What happens if you lie about finishing your Degree going to the school but never finished,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Question what happens if u lied about your age but your old enough  have your ID and work permit during a job interview,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Should you lie Absolutely Employers arent honest and youd be a fool to admit your shortcoming to your potential employers when bills need to be paid NEVER DISPLAY EMPLOYMENT GAPS Play the game or someone else will eat your lunch,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,One you should never be honest with their resume resume not interview because youll usually get rejected if you have a job gap,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I made it clear to my manager that I was only a beginner in SQL and Python and I was given a couple of weeks time after joining to get myself familiarized with both Im glad I didnt lie or else I would have been expected to deliver right from day 1 and I wouldve definitely failed

Thanks for the video helpful as always",0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Can you say what the basic SQL question that you asked the person was,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Nice video but I want to talk about my real story here I lie on my work experience and get my first job A lot of people said do not lie on your resume but most are bullshit Not your video Anyway do not feel bad for lying on your resume because youre not the only one Now Im 22 make around 100k in 1 year and bunch of benefits ez I lie on my resume because I have been the worst situation at that time,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Im glad I came across your video when I decided to switch career Thanks for always sharing great videos and knowledge,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I wish I had known about your mentorship sooner or I would have signed up for sure
I let my GitHub repositories speak for themselves as far as my skill level goes Now explaining to a future employer about my nearly three year employment gap since graduation working only parttime jobs unrelated to the field I would explain that finding any job to leverage the skills I acquired during my degree program has been challenging and have had to take parttime jobs here and there to pay the bills and put food on the table until I acquired the necessary skills to gain employment in this field",1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I legit will be emailing you for mentorship hoping you say yes this is so amazing we just dont have the resources to know these things man SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I fee there are times when its ok to lie by omission  to leave off information that may skew you into roles that dont interest you   My degree in mathematics is on there  My degree in economics is not,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,In Australia sometimes you have to lie to hide your qualification or experience because some manager will feel threatened about hiring someone who can out do them in a few years We think people with master degrees are losers,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Hey Alex great video and content And explanations are crisp and clear I am a mechanical engineer with four years of experience I am looking forward to switch my career to data analytics and data science I would like to integrate machine learning to my domain and increase the skillset Can you please share your thoughts on this  Is there a way to reach you 
Thank you",1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thanks I had a thought to lie but now its crystal clear why I shouldnt,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Agreed Especially in Tech to lie on your resume is one of the worst ideas,-1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Great tips for sure More people need to see this especially fresh out of college folks,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I am in an interesting position because I am ultimately looking to transition into Data Analytics and have been doing a combination of self teaching and getting my MBA to hopefully move into finance or tech I have gotten an increase in analytics responsibilities in my current job and have pushed myself to utilize the new skills and tools I learned such as Python and SQL so I can list them on my resume without feeling guilty about lying,0
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thank Alex for this important topic,1
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thank you for the tips and you are totally right,1

ncXgqGePvwI,If youve taken a bootcamp please let me know below Id love to hear your experience after taking one,1
ncXgqGePvwI,"Hi Alex

Hoping all is well

Thank you for your video You gave some great advice and highlighted some key points Im here today to give a series of updates over the next few months regarding a data analyst bootcamp that I will be starting in 2 weeks I currently hold a bachelors in Exercise Science from UConn and am pursuing a masters in Health Informatics from Purdue Global I hope to land a job after completing this bootcamp while in school then eventually landing something higher paying upon completion of my masters degree

This is a change in my original career pursuit of becoming a physical therapist which I found the student debt I almost got myself in to to be outrageous I believe for me the return of investment in this field is much much higher considering my loans currently are 110 of what I wouldve been paying back in PT",0
ncXgqGePvwI,My wife and I are thinking about taking the boot camp but were worried with the new AI technology taking over,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Hey Alex Thank you for all the information and time you put into making this videoAny thoughts on Colombia University Data Analysis bootcamp Thank you,0
ncXgqGePvwI,Thank you for taking the time to give advice The offer I was given by one bootcamp for UIUX was 15000 with a 3 month full time track and job guarantee I will research my way through Udemy Khan LinkedIn and others,1
ncXgqGePvwI,2 years later do you still feel this way There are a lot more options available now Ive seen offerings from over 20 companies Thinkful General Assembly Codecademy etc plus ones from companies like EdX that partner with universities Id love an update with your thoughts As someone whos trying to break into this profession in 2023 with no coding background but a BSBA double major in economics and finance the number of Bootcamp and online certificate options is a bit overwhelming Thanks in advance if you update and thanks anyway if not Love the channel,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Im contemplating doing a bootcamp but I have no other real tech experience  Im really wondering if a DA bootcamp  my liberal arts bachelors degree will cut it,1
ncXgqGePvwI,I dont have a bachelors degree I never finished school I have some university coursework I have a customer service background  I currently have a county job I want to make a career change but Im so confused on how You said if you dont have a bachelors degree and just a boot camp certificate youre likely not to get the job Should I go back and get my degree It was in Sociology Not really field related either So idk what to do,0
ncXgqGePvwI,Have you ever heard of Merit America I would love a video on that as Im applying and Ive only seen positives associated with it You pay 0 up front and dont pay anything until you get a job making 40k or more a year Plus they work with your schedule so you dont have to quit your job You put in about 2025 hours per week for 16 weeks The price is 5400 no interest and you pay 95 a month after you get a job I want to know your opinions on this as Ive watched your videos for a while and would love feedback,1
ncXgqGePvwI,I recently withdrew from a software engineering degree due to financial reasons but I can afford to take on a data analysis bootcamp while Im out of school do you think that will be enough for me to land a job I have coding experience dating back to high school but not much job experience I spent most of my years in collegehigh school doing freelance IT technical support on fiverr doing computer optimizations desktoplaptopphone repairs and creating software programs for friends when I have the time,0
ncXgqGePvwI,So I got a masters in computer and information systems My bachelors is in psychology I did a career change and went into IT My problem has been that the program undid my masters in was new so not as structured as it probably is now Because of that I did not get any real experience and could not land any real entry level job because I am over qualified And since of that reason I have no real job experience because no one was really giving me a chance Now Im looking to get back into the workforce after being a stay at home dad but I think in order for me to do that these bootcamps might be the quickest way Not concerned about cost Friend I know who have done these bootcamps have been successful and found a job quickly,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Alex what do you think about Georgia techs data analysis bootcamp,0
ncXgqGePvwI,Do you suggest to taking courses from Coursera first or any online courses or do bootcamps first Right now I want a career change in my life and Ive been interested in data analyst entry jobs,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Is it required to take data science before taking data analytics courses,0
ncXgqGePvwI,With no degree once I have some experience will that be enough Or will I always struggle to find a job without a degree And does a boot camp look good on a resume or does it just highlight my lack of higher education,1
ncXgqGePvwI,"Alex  super quick question if money was NOT an issue AT ALL would you recommend any of these bootcamps if yes which ones
PS I feel like my answer wouldve been no given the plethora of astronomically cheaperfree courses out there  the dedication to truly learning all of the skills and technologies in depth can only be done by myself at my own pace and which schools and bootcamps arent really conducive for",1
ncXgqGePvwI,What about bootcamps that requires you to pay only after getting placed,0
ncXgqGePvwI,"Hi Alex I have recently subscribed to your channel as I plan to become a Data analyst I would appreciate your input on the below
I currently hold a Masterss Degree in Supply chain management but have not worked in this space I have worked in the Project management and Operations management space with shipping companies Recently I moved to Canada and am looking for courses through which I can enhance my knowledge in Data Analytics I finally narrowed down my search to the University of Toronto Data Analytics boot camp and Mc Gill Universitys Professional Development Certificate in Data Analytics for Business or  Professional DevelopmentCertificate In Data Science and Machine Learning I am 40 and need a University name also to back my credentials Hoping to get some clarity from you",0
ncXgqGePvwI,Are there card games or board games that are about Data Analytics It would make learning fun,1
ncXgqGePvwI,I have a masters degree in public policy from Germany and I have just been selected for a bootcamp in data analyst The price is 12500 Euros that you can only pay once you get a job offer 250 Euros per month Does the risk worth it,0
ncXgqGePvwI,Daddy,0
ncXgqGePvwI,I have a bachelors in stats I also learned more excel skills through linkedin learning How can I get started through an internship,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Alex I got my bachelors degree in IT back in 2011 worked for a year in IT then life took in another route more with administrative work I got my MBA in 2018 but I am lost now and would like to major in Data Analytics I live DC area How should I start,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Thank you so much Alex for all your videos They are helping me with organizing my thoughts,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Aye man Im thinking about applying for a Washington university data analytics boot camp for under a little under 13k for 24 weeks I have no experience and but they go over most things in the field Mentioned about helping with resumes and landing my first job Also said that they would aid me with the degree if I choose to go further,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Does the bachelors degree have to be a computer science degree,0
ncXgqGePvwI,What are your thoughts on bootcamps for people with degrees changing careers I have a BA with a minor in stats I work in finance and I want to move into analytics or data science I plan on getting a MS but I want some on my resume now so I can start applying for jobs I already have some coding experience through my minor such as SQL R and SAS,0
ncXgqGePvwI,Nice video I am really lost about my career path after leaving my nursing major  but I am going to be using ur resources n other resources that r online to teach my self Hopefully in 6 month I will be able to do projects n build my pro folio,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Would data entry clerk be a good job position to start the career through data analyst after having the job just upgrade skills with programming,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Would you mind sharing your email I want to ask some detailed questions Thanks in advance,1
ncXgqGePvwI,I have taken one I highly recommend just going to Web dev bootcamp first and learning the data analyst stuff in your free timeOne for the simple reason you can get a data analyst job just knowing sql and how to do chartsI took the data scientist route and when I interview with employers they are basically looking for software engineers then being able to apply data techniques maybe for visualizationJust my opinion,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Alex what would you suggest as an alternative If Im self taught or boot camp certified that still leaves me with not meeting the minimum qualifications of a bachelors degree And a bachelors degree is overall much more expensive and time consuming than a boot camp,0
ncXgqGePvwI,Hi Alex Youre doing great I really like your videos,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Im currently undertaking a free offline 6 months Data Science bootcamp organized by the Korean government If I attend the class over 80 each month the government pays me 300 per month The class is MonFri 9am6pm and provides students laptops Im learning SQL Python R ML DL NLP HadoopSpark Elasticsearch AWS so far All professors hold a Phd in Industrial Engineering from Korea University one of the top universities in Korea This program is very good,1
ncXgqGePvwI,You mentioned that if you only have a degree and a data analyst boot camp on your resume then you wont meet the minimum requirement  Besides the obvious experience what would you recommend to make me qualified    Thanks,0
ncXgqGePvwI,I just want to confirm that the links you have recommended are what youd most definitely recommend and not just because of sponsorship Thank you for putting such helpful content out for us,1
ncXgqGePvwI,I have friends taking bootcamps for 15k and they ask for help quite often my courses are from Udemy and some other cheap places it is not about which course or school you taking it from it is about how passion you are to learn it and then how curious you are about whats next love the frustration Sometimes i dream in code and i am not kidding,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Thank you for the light  direction,1
ncXgqGePvwI,What about a masters degree in data analytics from wgu What are your thought,0
ncXgqGePvwI,I am currently working on becoming an analyst and started a boot camp not too long ago Ive been looking for someone in the field to become my mentor but havent had any luck Would you be willing to guide me,1
ncXgqGePvwI,How much do you use python is your daily activities Compare it to your usage of SQL proportion wise Hope my English is clear enough,1
ncXgqGePvwI,For real thank you man for  directing us for the right way,1
ncXgqGePvwI,Hi Alex are you going to add any advanced sql courses you are a very good teacher,1
ncXgqGePvwI,What materialssites did you use to learn SQL,0
ncXgqGePvwI,I have come to believe that no matter what courses you have taken what bootcamps you went to or what books you used to study at the end of the day its about whether you know your stuff or not Of course its not purely binary because some people know more about SQL Python or just have better insights in general than others but what counts is passing the code interview and the other interviews Let me know if you have other angles on this,1
ncXgqGePvwI,I am currently enrolled on the data analytics bootcamp from georges Washington University I can tell that you dont need it if you have the dedication and the commitment to learn which is what I have been struggling ever since i started my data journey But the fact that you can put that on your resume would help i guess,0

What bothers me is that Alex the creator of this video is clearly avoiding the question in the comments and is saying things like I havent had time to research this A 30 second search will give you the answer to why twitterscraper isnt working

There is a working alternative and Ill let you find it yourself again check the GitHub",-1

MpIi4HtCiVk,"Hi Alex  you have done a very clean and sweet presentation And from your video i know how people scape data from twitter now  However sometimes when people post a tweet they add pictures right below to explain themselves more clearly By using the scraping bot we can get the text but we missed the pictures  

So it is possible to output the data into a word file by keeping both the text and picture in order 

Thanks",1

G4syHs3M82E,in my exp the roles are swapped My life as a data analyst had much more expectations less resources  software and required much more business exp My life as a business analyst required more technical skills and was more closely tied to leadership I spent 7 years more aligned as a DA and 3 years as a BA and it was much much harder as a DA,1
G4syHs3M82E,Business analysts receive more salary than data analysts,1
G4syHs3M82E,Great breakdown but Id like to add that Business Analysts dont always come from business or MBA backgrounds Many enter the field through certifications and practical experience especially in datafocused roles Certifications like CBAP PMIPBA or even structured learning paths such as the Business Analyst Track from 365 Data Science can equip professionals with the right skills In todays job market handson skills in SQL Excel BI tools and realworld problemsolving often outweigh traditional degrees,1

G4syHs3M82E,Data Analyst vs Business Analyst  Which Is Right For You,1
G4syHs3M82E,For you who are googling for this and get hinged on the salary its good to remember that these are mostly US salary levels For example in Switzerland a Business Analyst  Data Analyst make the same salary from junior through to mid but in senior the Business Analyst is actually earning more So check out stuff like that depending on where you live because this has a lot to do with demand and supply Some countries have more business analysts and some more data analysts though at the end of the day these are in demand in most countries and youll probably make a really good earning,1

G4syHs3M82E,So simple  so good,1
G4syHs3M82E,Great video,1
G4syHs3M82E,Thanx alot i was stressed becuse of the confusion you made it clear,0
G4syHs3M82E,Wow Alex so glad I found your videos  Was just searching for how to best utilize Linkedin for gaining a job and then turns out I find your video about Linkedin and youre a Data Analyst  what Im taking courses in now haha  And in Coursea so Ill be watching your other videos on their courses next to see what you have to say  This video is super helpful as I want to work remotely  Ive been living out of the US and really am hoping to land a job that will allow me to work outside the US  I am an extrovert and have many soft skills related to the Business Analyst position that I would LOVE but I figured a position as a Data Analyst would be more likely to allow me to be completely remote ie dealing with tech team and mainly staff vs dealing with clients  Would you agree  Do you think it would be possible to get a completely remote position as a Data Analyst  If you have any insight Id really love to hear and maybe even talk with you sometime if thats a possibility,1
G4syHs3M82E,"Dear Veterans 
A young aspirant here seeking knowledge to answer my questions
1 I like numbers I wanna work where in I need to derive at conclusions by numbers I am not sure if its called data analyst or data scientist
2 I am studying project management and I am interested in it as well but dont have technical knowledge as my specialization was business administration could you please help me if PM is the right field for me
3 Is machine learning required to be the data analyst as I dont want to be someone building tools to analyse but be an analyst",0
G4syHs3M82E,The example for salary is  for year,0
G4syHs3M82E,Is it true for these roles to overlap sometimes For example the job advertised to me on LinkedIn when I applied was data analyst meanwhile after I got the job offer the official title was a business analyst When I looked it up  a business analyst is sometimes considered a subset of data  analyst What do you think,1
G4syHs3M82E,I am a business and data analyst and i suppose that business analyst should take higher salary understanding management and work flow has experience with dealing with customers and companys departments and his team I think his recommendations and actions have the business sense if we comapre them to data analyst presented Technical skills are easier to learn and apply more than life work and people experiences,1
G4syHs3M82E,Sir business analysis and business analyst are same or different If they both are different so which course is better,1

appOFpF2pFg,420 You can use their free videos but how much time are you going to have for that before your trial expires,1
appOFpF2pFg,"401 Sorry Alex but I am going to have to disagree with you here Power BI has Power BI Desktop which is free You can fool around with it along with Power Query  a powerful pun intended tool to manipulate cleanwrangle your data before creating your visualizations
Tableau on the other hand costs to get into Yes you can get a 7day trial but realistically how many Tableau courses can you finish in 1 week

Therefore I find Power BI to be more accessible to get into",1
appOFpF2pFg,"Alex or anyone else I made a big mistake on my application I was looking at my documents I had when I was applying for a data analyst position I graduated with a bachelors degree in general studies but decided to go back for my computer science degree and my masters in data analytics 
So the thing is I used the computer science program when I should have used the degree I was actually conferred This honestly was a mistake I have the skills to become DA and my on boarding for the job is next Monday Do you think the HR team will understand the mistake or will they simply just fire me I really dont know how to correct the error",1

B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you for your help From South Africa,0
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Alex I finished the Database and SQL for Data Science on Coursera It took me 2 Days The course was too easy not enough knowledge to gain and the Python part was poorly explained glad it wasnt my first time working with an API

I took a free PSQL course posted by FreeCodeCamp on youtube  and it was better structured more carefully explained more information and it took me around 6 hours to finish the 4 hours tutorial with pausing the video and playing with the queries

Then I saw that on UDEMY there are three begginer courses that stick out beside the one provided by you
1 SQL  MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence  by 365 DataScience they even have their own platform where they provide courses structured in modules and a verifiable certificate

2  The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2021 Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla

3 The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp Go from SQL Beginner to Expert by Colt Steele

Could you please review them 
I would love your opinion

B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hi Alex Thanks for all this info Its great cuz I believe I now know more about how to become a Data Analyst However you didnt touch on the certifications to obtain after all that learning Could you help with that please,1

B2SPC3Wz1R8,Alex great video  Just want to add some context to Courseras UC Davis Data Visualization With Tableau recommendation  This is a great course to learn the fundamentals of data visualization and what you learn will help you with whatever software you choose to utilize  In the course you will learn the basics of how to use Tableau but this is not an indepth how to do everything in Tableau  Many students come into the course with that misperception and miss the platformagnostic knowledge of visualizing data  Again great video and thanks for sharing your journey,1
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Would you recommend the Udemy courses to be taken in the order that you show in your video or is there a better more effective way to take the courses Which would you recommend for me to start with as I dont have any knowledge or experience on data analytics I was accepted to start my bachelors in Business analytics Im just trying to jump in now rather than waiting,1
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Is it best to initially learn Python by itself before incorporating the Data Analysis aspect,1
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Tysm for this video have been searching for this here and there but they all were really messed up  Tysm once again,1
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Alex the 1st course listed in your links has been updated and expanded You may want to update your Udemy link,0
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"I think your approach of individual courses is better than the certificate programs though the IBM or Google one via Coursera would be a nice addition Thank you so much for the info Saving the video and the list

My thinking
1 Learn programming Python R SAS
2 Learn spreadsheets Excel Google Sheets
3 Learn visualization Tableau Power BI
4 Learn to query SQL
5 Learn Git and GitHub putting projects there will help build portfolio

A note to all dont pay full price for Udemy courses Wait until they go on sale then buy a couplefew to hold you over until the next sale If you are low income Coursera offers financial aid Have to answer 3 essay questions and wait 15 days to know whether approved or not Have to apply for each course Get on mailing lists of various learning platforms Datacamp recently had 3 days free Also the first module of most courses is always free Check out bundle packages on TNW deals  thenextweb  com I think They even have pay what you want",1

Currently iam studying btech ece electronics and communication engineering can i become a data scientist or data analyst with that particular degree
I dont have interest in electronics and electrical stuff 
Is it possible please respond",0
fUpChfNN5Uo,A lot of these companies dont know the differences they could be looking for an Analyst but you end up performing Data Engineer and Data Scientist duties that is they dont have the right infrastructure in place so you end up building pipelines to create your single point of truth before you can start any Analysis after that is done regular maintenance of you pipelines and analytics duties and soon enough adhoc queries of predictions which becomes Data Scientist job,0

fUpChfNN5Uo,I graduated with a masters in data science in 2022 in an effort to break into the data career space My program focused on learning Python and data manipulation with Pandas and then jumped right into machine learning I learned nothing about using Tableau or Power BI to create data models reports or dashboards I learned nothing about the distinctions between data analyst data scientist or machine learning engineer In my job search my masters in data science has impressed precisely NO ONE,1

fUpChfNN5Uo,"I have a bachelors in mathematics and it is the whole reason I got interested in data analysis

Initially I wanted to be an airline pilot

 Im considering getting a masters in data science because I feel that data science will not involve PROOF WRITING AND ADVANCED THEORETICAL MATHEMATICS lol which is PAIN there are still unsolved problems today

Anyway if I get the masters Im definitely going to pursue a career as a data scientist Currently Im about to start my first data analyst role I already started learning a thing or two about Linear Regression supervised learning in Machine Learning and although you just told me that I wont be using it in this role I feel that I should stay the course and keep learning anyway because ifwhen I go to take my masters Ill already know things and thats LIT",1
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Is it possible to start as a Data analyst and later in the career switch to Data scientist

The Data scientist sounds way more interesting not just because of the pay however I am missing the Masters degree",1

Dk7he_yEs4U,Im using MySql workbench on Mac and I had to use the CONCAT function in order to put the first and last names together Im confused arent you using MySQL also and so why didnt the  work for me then,0
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Hi Alex You channel is amazing and helps me a lot to understand SQL easier I have a question what if I put a prefix or suffix on every table column so they never repeat names Is it a good practice Does is make any difference at all

For example
Employee
    empid
    empname
    empdocument

Salary
    salid
    salempid
    salvalue


Thanks in regards",1
Dk7he_yEs4U,Short and effective,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,Yes yes YES That thing about using a b c to aliasing tables makes everything so confusing thank you for pointing that out because now I feel so much more confident to use actual labels as alias,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thank you so much Alex straight to the point and simple Grateful for you
Please is there a video where you show an example of subqueries and aliasing Using the right alias at the different levels of nesting For example

Select emp 
From
        select a 
        From 
                select col1 col1 
                from employees as emp  as a where 
 as vwempswithouta


I believe in this case saying select emps on the first line is wrong the correct thing to use will be vwempswithouta 
This will make more sense as to why aliasing if JOINS where involved this is just a shortened example",1
Dk7he_yEs4U,That is very helpful video for beginners big THANK YOU ALEX,0
Dk7he_yEs4U,Your positive attitude and teamwork have made a significant impact,1

Dk7he_yEs4U,Hi Alex This course is very good What kind of SQL did you use in this course,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,HI ALEX SIR  HOW ARE YOU  LOVE FROM INDIA,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,"I disagree on your opinion on lettering joins The reason being is that if my join list gets to be 5 6 7 tables then I have an idea of where the table is in the join list as long as I adhere to that alphabetic order So if I see my column is in table D or E then I can quickly look down the list to find that table The alias does not readily tell you what the tables full name and path are What if you have similarly named tables in more than one schema What if you are not familiar with these tables If I letter them I can quickly figure out where in my join I put the table Ive also run into enough issues where too many of the tables are named almost identically  I also think that putting too many letters in your alias also defeats the purpose of aliases Aliases are there to clean up the code and shorten the column names
I can see renaming later after youve developed it but when trying to code all of this it clears confusion as to where the join is",1
Dk7he_yEs4U,really thank you for making this confusing aliasing queries looks easy,1

Dk7he_yEs4U,Tip For anyone using MySQL  use CONCAT function instead of  to combine the column names,0
Dk7he_yEs4U,I used that but the output is showing EmployeeID and salary without Items inside Where did I go wrong,-1
Dk7he_yEs4U,Just a small tip Aliases cant be used as a filter condition in the WHERE clause Ex lets say you merge firstname and lastname and name the column as fullname you cant go like WHERE fullname like A fullname starting with A   IT WONT WORK but it works with Order By Hope it helps   PS Experience based on MYSQL only not sure about others,-1
Dk7he_yEs4U,You Are The Best,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,Excellent stuff here Very easy to grasp on to,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank you so much Alex for the knowledge I am now a fast learner,1

Dk7he_yEs4U,thanks,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,This is not a hard subject but confusing at least for me I saw a LinkedIn course on SQL and I saw aliasing there The instructor was using a b and c and to say I was confused is an understatement Thanks for the video makes a lot more sense now,0
Dk7he_yEs4U,You explained really well however the best part of the video was your databaselol,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,hi can anyone explain to me why theres a bracket on the table name is that optional or something sorry i tried both and both works the same im just asking because maybe theirs a special reason behind it,-1

Dk7he_yEs4U,How come in this video some of it is in brackets,0
Dk7he_yEs4U,I am glad I am not the only one that gets frustrated when someone simply uses a single letter to define a Table alias I thought my frustration with that was just me being a beginner I am glad an expert such as yourself feels the same way I feel better now Great videos by the way I am working my way down the entire SQL playlist Are you by chance also fluent in Python and have plans to do a Python playlist in the future,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,At work Ive used the single letters to refer to tables and so have some colleagues of mine but I think you make a good point that its too abstract and gets confusing the longer the script gets  Im going to make sure I do it the way you suggested from now on,1
Dk7he_yEs4U,Hey Alex Can you please tell as to why are you putting brackets for SQLTutorial and dbo Third line at 509 Im new to this stuff A little help please,0

rLKC--8UYSw,hey Alex appreciate all the videos theyve been quite helpful I have a question about how much knowledge to have in python Right now Id say im pretty comfortable with data cleaning and data visualizations Is there anything else youd say is necessary or helpful that i can try and learn for a data analyst role I know SQL is probably the most important skill but just want to be prepared with Python skills as well so im not stumped in an interview or anything Thanks man,1
rLKC--8UYSw,Hi Alex loving your videos Im more on the bioinformatics side and want to go into a career in data as the two are really related also the full skillset of a data analyst would be a really good video as previously mentioned,1

fweZQqB0nwQ,Hey Alex Nice vdeo One feedback audios is quite low to listen mobile,1
fweZQqB0nwQ,I have a bit of a dilemma I get advice to not show age but only including the past 10 years of work experience The thing is I want to move back to health care analytics and I had solid experience in revenue cycle a variety of cerner products medical records HL7 HMO  plus a nursing degree  That experience was 15 to 20 years ago though  My current experience is government software testing  but nothing to do with healthcare,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,i can barely hear anything,0

fweZQqB0nwQ,Also what if you dont have experience with some of the tools preferred in the JD How do you answer,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,Hi Alex today I got my job offer for the data analyst role I am thrilled Thank you for all the help I followed your channel religiously and your interview tips really helped me to ace the interview The best advice you gave was to start doing projects instead of taking class after class because I was one of those people who was focused more on taking class than to practice my skills After watching that video of yours I started working on my projects instead I am really grateful to you Thank you for being part of my journey and for guiding so many people like me I look forward to learning more from your channel,1
fweZQqB0nwQ,Audio is really low,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,For questions about culture does it hurt to ask questions about specific aspects of the culture  I recently asked what a company does to support the health and wellbeing of its employees and to prevent burnout  I worry that questions like that can make it seem like Im not willing to put in effort when needed but at the same time I dont want to jump into a meat grinder,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,you are a Genius,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,Do you think these questions stay the same even if youre interviewing internally Or would they be different,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,nice one alex,1
fweZQqB0nwQ,So my current status is I went to college for Stats degree learned statistics some analysis R and Java but still feel a bit underprepared I want to become a data analyst as soon as possible The problem is the interview I studied certain questions but I wanna know how to get to a point where I always know what the interviewer is talking about and can give a decent answer Ill keep studying SAS and SQL but I hear there are a lot of aspects of a data analysis project I am unfamiliar with so what is the best route I can take to get me to a point where I almost always know what they are talking about,1
fweZQqB0nwQ,Audio is too low,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,I am a dentist and want to switch to data analytics I am looking for a online course which is credible How do I start this journey Can you guide me,1

fweZQqB0nwQ,if i get rejected in the technical interview can I try again in the future when i have improved my skills,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,Appreciate your effort but not happy with the content in this particular video These are just behavioural questions Real time like tell me about your last project,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Great work Alex Thank you so much for these questions I also think some of the questions may change on the basis of region like people in US definitely would be asking some where different questions compared to people in India
One of the recruiter asked me questions on various use cases
Also I have been rejected with some lame excuse too even though my answers were correct 
Also I felt your voice is low in this video",0
fweZQqB0nwQ,Hii Alex Its very useful Please make a video on python too,1
fweZQqB0nwQ,definitely gonna watch this before interview,0

fweZQqB0nwQ,Can you make a video for Entry level jobs Interview Questions in Data Analytics,0
fweZQqB0nwQ,I am in general a perfectionist Its definitely my drawback Why am i not supposed to say this Pls let me know,0

fweZQqB0nwQ,Why cant we just be honest,1
fweZQqB0nwQ,Behavorial questions,0

fweZQqB0nwQ,"Hi Alex
First of all thanks for your content Your videos are very informative and helpful for my research to becoming a data analyst I am currently an accountant and have recently started looking at becoming an analyst I did not have a computer science or statistics or programming background but I know my excel and small amounts of SQL and your videos have encouraged me to start the transition 


Im currently using Khan Academy for basic SQL Stat and looking at Coursera or Udemy for SQL and Python I am also considering starting my road to get a certificate in Big Data from my local respected community college in my area I was wondering if you could put out a video about which resources you used when you were selfteaching yourself some of the technical skills Ive also found that not a ton of jobs respect many of these boot camps that are popping up left and right any opinion on that Because bootcamps are over promising obviously to learning many items in just 12 weeks

Again thanks for the great honest and informative content and youre very encouraging on the career path switch

WHERE Clause
Purpose

The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before any groupings are made It filters records based on specified conditions
Usage Applied to individual rows in a table
It cannot be used with aggregate functions like SUM COUNT AVG etc
When to Use Use the WHERE clause to filter records before aggregation or grouping

Example
SELECT  FROM Employees
WHERE Salary  50000

HAVING Clause
Purpose The HAVING clause is used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause has been applied It filters records based on aggregate conditions
Usage Applied to groups of rows created by the GROUP BY clause
Can be used with aggregate functions
When to Use Use the HAVING clause to filter aggregated data or groups of data

Example
SELECT DepartmentID COUNT AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT  10

Key Differences
Order of Execution
WHERE Filters rows before grouping and aggregation
HAVING Filters groups after grouping and aggregation
Scope
WHERE Filters individual rows
HAVING Filters aggregated data groups of rows
Aggregate Functions
WHERE Cannot be used with aggregate functions
HAVING Can be used with aggregate functions

Combined Use of WHERE and HAVING
In a single query both WHERE and HAVING clauses can be used together to filter data at different stages of the query
Filter rows before aggregation with WHERE
Filter groups after aggregation with HAVING

Example
SELECT DepartmentID AVGSalary AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE JobTitle  Engineer
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING AVGSalary  70000",0

When I create new tables then when writing the system does not suggest them like it does with previous tables what what could be happening The query works well anyway",0
lYKkro6rKm0,"Msg 205 Level 16 State 1 Line 5
All queries combined using a UNION INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists",0
lYKkro6rKm0,"So wouldnt you just use unions and where the columns contain the same data joiner say employee id make that the filtering attribute

It seems to me that unions are far more flexible but you still be careful to qualify it otherwise a union will just jam disparate data elements together

9URM1_2S0ho,Can I update the values in a column with values from another table all at once or would I need to do it one at a time For context I learned some SQL a while ago but was using your videos for some muchneeded review by completing a pet project cataloguing all the books in my house The books have a unique ID but I belatedly decided to alter the table and add a foreign key seriesID since a lot of my books are part of a series I have a series table with the series ID title author and number of books already populated Its about 400 books 53 series I dont want to update table 53 times for the different series if theres an easier way I understand that I can query using GROUP BY or DISTINCT I just want to know if this is possible Please and thank you,0
9URM1_2S0ho,the 1st use case is something michael scott could do,0
9URM1_2S0ho,very well explained,1
9URM1_2S0ho,alex pls can you help me out  i am using azure data studio and instead of sqltutorialdbo i am using masterdbo but its not executing  pls help,0
9URM1_2S0ho,"I am very sorry but I got redundancy in both table How can I remove the duplicate record

Ryan Holly and Darryl",-1
9URM1_2S0ho,Excuse me I am not quite understand the available databases In the video I found that the available databases changed from SQLTutorial to master May I know why it changed Is it because we want to use two table in the meantime EmployeeDemographics and EmployeeSalary or is there any reason Thanks in advance,1
9URM1_2S0ho,I have a question that probably has an easy answer but Im having trouble with When doing a Left Join how do I know which table I want to to be the left table and same for when I do a Right Join,0
9URM1_2S0ho,Where and how do I download all the programs you are using for a mac,0
9URM1_2S0ho,After struggling to understand joins today I came across this video and   it was so simple and straight to the point  Shukran,0
9URM1_2S0ho,I think in 1st use case We shouldnt have done INNER JOIN Look at the last person in EmployeeSalary Table which is a salesman and doesnt have employee ID If this person would have had the highest salary besides Michael our logic for identifying the individual would prove incorrect,0
9URM1_2S0ho,Very good explanation of joints Finally I understand it It will take some practice to get it under the skin but hardest part of understanding it is finally over I never understood it completely from other sources Alex the link for joins image is not working Thanks,1
9URM1_2S0ho,Hello Alex Thank you so much for your SQL tutorials they are really consistent explained in a really great pace the best material Ive found on YT to learn SQL Just a quick question Do you have any Intermediate Level SQL videos on Creating Views GETDATE and Primary Key vs Foreign Key on your channel Unfortunately I was not able to find those ones,1
9URM1_2S0ho,i think for the second case its better to use Right Outer join because there is a salesman without an id in en the employeesalary table thanks a lot for your teachings you are awesome,1
9URM1_2S0ho,1342  how to add one more name,1
9URM1_2S0ho,I cannot thank you enough for this simple explanation I nearly exhausted my resources for JOINs and nobody ever explained well enough for me to understand,0
9URM1_2S0ho,How do you know which table is the right table and which table is the left table,1
9URM1_2S0ho,when i insert the new values in getting duplicates HELP,1
9URM1_2S0ho,"Michael comes up with the genius idea of deducting 1000 from the highest paid employee after him 
Why does that sound so like Michael though haha",1
9URM1_2S0ho,you used the offices characters name funny,1
9URM1_2S0ho,Thank you for this video awesome explanation,1
9URM1_2S0ho,Really love your style with these videos Using the office as a template for looking at these problems and techniques is such a fantastic way of going about it,1
9URM1_2S0ho,Doesnt the average salesman salary you found at the end exclude the salesman that makes 43k wouldnt it be easier to find the average without a join and just looking at the EmployeeSalary table,-1
9URM1_2S0ho,my FULL OUTER JOIN stops at row 9 it just did not return the NULL rows I dont know why that happened,1
9URM1_2S0ho,Hi Alex I am really fortunate to have passed by a tiktok video that promoted your channel as one that offers learning guides in topics relating to data analytics Being a person who would like to transition to data analytics at 32 years old I still have doubts with regards to the unknown particularly on the things that still needs to be learnt I have already finished your Power BI for Beginners and now into SQL Though I have already finished the Khan Academy lessons on SQL I found that there are difference in the codes used in SQLServer compared to I think SQLlite in Khan Academy Like there we used TEXT instead of varchar50 and also we use doublequotations instead of single quotations Your explanation helped me a lot in understanding the concepts of LEFT OUTER JOIN FULL OUTER JOIN RIGHTOUTER JOIN AND INNER JOIN Theres one thing I am not sure of though Why was INNER JOIN used on the last example IS it because we are performing some sort of data cleaning and did not use salary data which does not have an Employee Demographic Kudos and more power on your channel,0
9URM1_2S0ho,Nice job Alex,1
9URM1_2S0ho,I was part of a paid bootcamp but I learned and understood the concepts a lot better from your free bootcamp than that paid one  Thanks a lot Alex Highly appreciate your work,1
9URM1_2S0ho,Great Job Alex,1

I appreciate any feedback Thanks",1
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi Alex I work in an engineering field with a manufacturing company as a sales guy With 10 yrs of experience I do some basic stuff in excel as part of sales analysis Looking to get into data analytics I did PostgreSQL  Tableau courses in the pandemic lockdown time I am now very confident after learning this backend  frontend tools Some of my friends still recommend learning ETL tools like Informatica And I find ETL tools are not open source and hence not able to work handson So havent started learning it yet
Whats your advice for me and do you have any ETL course on offer
Thank you  Best wishes from India",1

Is a data analyst a common job these days What I mean is most of different companies has the data analyst position
And if you want to change into different area such as a biomedical cooperate as a data analyst is it easier or you need to have some domain knowledge about biology",0
qzZU6LAtIig,Being a Data Analyst do you spend most of your day in your cubicle How often do you get to collaborate with coworkers and talk to other people Do you feel like you just do the same thing everyday or is there more variety than it seems,1

qzZU6LAtIig,So it seemed at least to me that you actually spent a lot of time in meetings as opposed to time actually compiling and reporting data Is that typical I am looking into going to school for cloud computing while I simultaneously hit a data analysis course at a local uni I have only manual labor experience so I am hoping this gets me out of the rain and into an office seat Id honestly be happy with an entry level job making 4045k Do you think thats realistic for someone with no office experience fresh out of school in a metro area Thanks for the video by the way This is appreciated,0

LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks for the content  How do we actually find and import data sets into SQL to practise on as you suggest doing at the end of this video,0
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks man,1
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Its good content in general For the sake of education Id suggest going the extra mile and always showing as much as you reasonably can For example when youre showing how the WHERE clause can still be utilized it would be nice to see a second query and both sets of results simultaneously where you also include the AGE column so we can see the results in a different form Its not necessary but for beginners visuals can be really useful,1

LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Ive been following your channel and content for a while now I completed the Google Data Analytics Certification from coursera and even though I really enjoyed it the SQL part of that course wasnt as good as I expected It took A LOT of time to get to this stage of the learning and you totally nailed it in just a couple of videos which makes it perfect because you go straight to the point I will continue this SQL tutorials to get a deeper understanding of the tool and to finally get projects to showcase this new skill

Completed on Day 2 March 26 2023",0
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Hey Alex thanks for making this im really happy that someone is willing to offer knowledge transfer so willingly and not gatekeep My question is I have completed Series 1 But now what Obviously i can transition over into the intermediate series sure But I definitely do not have the basics down Unless I missed this somewhere i do not see any hands on experience besides following along I tried Khan academy but idk if its a glitch in their software but they dont actually explain if your doing right or wrong You just move along So how or where do we practice Ill admit the easiest option is to just make things up and play around but ill admit until im comfortable with the basics i dont know what i dont know so its hard to be creative when your still so new its like someone saying learn excel or google sheets but if you have no idea what can even be accomplished or know what can be done your just learning a function I guess my only request is i wish there was more practice offered or even references of where to practice that will help learn the basics and become more comfortable Either way this is all great work,1

A9TOuDZTPDU,Hello first of all thank you I am learning with these videos 0 experience  I noticed that on minute 7 when you were giving the example for IN you accidentally mentioned AND however the IN is used for OR If you state first name Jim and first name michael it will not give you a line because in my mindand since SQL did not return anything there are no entries with both first namesOMG I cant believe I just wrote that,1

A9TOuDZTPDU,We can use  instead of  also right,1
A9TOuDZTPDU,Not sure if anyone is still active on these but when I try to use a SELECT FROM with a WHERE query it doubles all my values On the original table all values are single but it returns doubles when I search and Im not sure why Appreciate any help,0
A9TOuDZTPDU,"IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR Statements 

In the example Alex writes
SELECT  FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName  Jim AND FirstNameMichael then explains we can use IN instead of multiple AND Operators

In above mentioned query we are looking for someone with both Jim and Michael as their firstname

Instead we are looking for rows where FirstName is either Jim or Michael

We can achieve this by simply using OR operator instead of AND operator

SELECT  FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName  Jim OR FirstNameMichael

Rather than writing multiple OR operator like above we can use IN
SELECT  FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName IN Jim  Michael",0

A9TOuDZTPDU,And this is why Im doing this boot camp first and then doing the Coursea Google Data Analytics cert  AWESOME,1
A9TOuDZTPDU,Took me a few minutes to figure out that you were highlightingselecting only the select  from statement and not including where Knowing this selection option before running a query would have been very helpful in not getting an error every time I tried to run the query Might I suggest your Bootcamp include in the beginning an understanding of the structure and how SQL and the SQL interface works vs jumping into commands and queries,0
A9TOuDZTPDU,my problem is finding where the characteristics are in the keyboard,0

Its a complicated industry where titles are mixed around vaguely describing responsibilities A lot of the lower paying data analyst roles may be leaning more on the reporting responsibilities of a business analyst

9o9loJpG-t4,Lol i saw that video and totally didnt believe it and had to fact check it too,1
9o9loJpG-t4,Entry for me was 70k but I live in the ny tristate area which  has a high cost of living,1
9o9loJpG-t4,Late to the party but I just recently found your channel Loving it I think perception through average overall gives people a skewed view of salary because wealth distributed across the world is skewed I think using the median helps paint a better perspective because that shows what will the actual middle man get paid Suppose the lowest end would be like 10 dollars mid would be 100 and the 100th percentile would be 1000 average salary would yield a much higher value than the median So people go in thinking they would get paid a lot more but in reality it is just because people on top makes a significantly larger salary than those in the middle and the bottom,1
9o9loJpG-t4,Wow Thank you so much for making this video I actually watch her videos as research on data analytics I completely believed her when I watched this video This is exactly why independent research is so important and not taking what anyone says on youtube as gospel,1
9o9loJpG-t4,I think most of these salary guides are bullshit tbh Its just such a one dimensional view of the employment market For a start any data analyst will tell you that you need a better idea of the distribution whether that be a box plot the IQR something like that and the majority of salary guides only have the median This seems one of the few cases that has some extra details And then they dont appear to define the job titles correctly eg miss out roles which logically should be there,1
9o9loJpG-t4,"Thank you for this video Im 12 years into my IT career and make 80k as a Sr Systems Engineer I am road mapping my path to six figures and have been focusing on data analytics because I was under the impression it pays in the 100  120 range as standard Im learning R and Python and was planning on SQL and Statistics next I have a degree in mathematics so I do have some experience there 

I live in the Midwest and there seems to be an incredible amount of wealthy people around and I have to wonder what they all do to make so much I am doing well but am still paying off student loans I dont live extravagantly by any stretch 

Now I should also qualify I made way less for most of my career having graduated after the housing crash in 08 It was a VERY slow climb to get to this point and I was making lower than average for every title Id had until last year 

I am not certain exactly what to do maybe I should pursue an MBA Maybe become a software developer I want more for myself and am willing to work for it The path just doesnt seem clear",1
9o9loJpG-t4,I had a 10 year career ending making 60k took a 13 year career break and now im on contract   at 3225hour  I was hoping to make 70k coming back in but hopefully this contract is a good stepping off point for me,1
9o9loJpG-t4,Alex it is true depending on the industry i work in oil company and they pay min 80k year just knowing excel basics and some power bi if you know python ML power bi and dax you can scale it up to even 90 to 100k year between junior and middle level,1
9o9loJpG-t4,Ok so heres my official mildly researched take First of all you are probably looking at a different source than what she looked at This is the 2019 Robert Half Accounting and Finance Salary guide it forecasts salaries for 2019 The Job you are looking at seems to be specifically for Data Analysts in Corporate Accounting Robert Half has other salary guides such as the Technology Salary guide I think She probably looked at the tech guide for 2020 I saw your comment saying it doesnt look like the 2020 version is out yet but it was definitely out at the time this video was created I found an article from August 2019 discussing the release of the 2020 Guides According to the Technology guide In the tech industry A Data AnalystReport Writer Makes 84750 at the 25th percentile and 100250 at the 50th percentile which should be at least approximately the median I think These sound a lot like her numbers she may have taken the 25th percentile and reported it as an entry level salary statistic which while not entirely honest is probably not too far off for this particular set of jobs since your entry levels are generally going to be the ones around that 25th percentile mark i think Now Im still not confident we should take the rest at face value first of all I dont know what proportion of Data Analyst jobs fit into Tech as opposed to other fields like finance second Robert Half is an HR consulting Firm Their numbers are based on their own placement and Im sure that could skew the data I just dont know how Also worth considering that She seems to have a very specific idea in her head when she talks about data analysts different than what most people might think based on job titles She clearly thinks a lot of Data Analyst jobs are Not real Data Analysts despite being labeled as such Maybe this is misleading on her part but she seems to bring it up constantly so idk for example Ive seen your video about becoming a Data Analyst with no experience Based on the way you describe your first data job making 47k Id imagine shed say thats more of a Data Reporting Analyst type job which she frequently distinguishes from Data Analyst when she talks about Salaries not to mention the fact that you got the job seemingly without a particularly relevant degree I dont think you said but I imagined something like Psychology or Social Work based on your first two jobs She usually talks about Math degrees as common for data analyst And personally as an aspiring Data Analyst and Aspiring Data Scientist who has spent time around echo chambers like the rdatascience subreddit I probably Wouldnt think Data Analyst when I hear that job description When I think data analyst I expect more statistical tools being involved For example Im Working thru a fairly popular textbook called Introduction to Statistical Learning with R which covers the basics of applied statistical techniques like Regression and Support Vector Machines Ive been under the impression that This is the kind of stuff associated with the term Data Analyst Along with data queries and cleaning and stuff,1
9o9loJpG-t4,84k did sound high to me but 40k also sounds low to me When I did job searches in my area which is a city I saw a lot of entry level stuff from like 5575k Entry level stuff past that was usually labeled entry level data scientist or something like that Also I might be wrong but it seems like higher salaries would make sense based on the kinds of degrees these jobs seem to ask for I almost always see them asking for at least a bachelors in a Quantitative field which usually includes MathStat Physics Chemistry Economics Computer Science or engineering And I could be terribly mistaken as a student with no work experience but I was under the impression those degrees had a tendency to command higher salaries especially Compsci and Enee thats what I always hear at least And I also sometimes see that a masters degree is preferred I certainly hope people arent taking on loans for a masters degree to make just 40k But idk maybe Ive been Nave and I have a rude awakening coming up after graduation,-1
9o9loJpG-t4,45k is correct this is where i am as an entry lvl analyst and we doing just sql server and excel work,0
9o9loJpG-t4,So while I definitely dont agree the numbers are that high I did find that on Robert Halfs 2020 Technology Salary guide Data AnalystReport writer did have the numbers she was stating,0
9o9loJpG-t4,My son got 63 k entry level in1920,0
9o9loJpG-t4,well  Now we know she a horrible data or business analyst LOL,0
9o9loJpG-t4,"Its so funny you reviewed her I watch half of one of her videos and definatly felt her content wasnt quality and way to stiff I found you soon after your information and types of videos  are more relatable to  my demographic   Female 30s city life  persueing new career prospects due to quarantine pandemic Museum Masters  most museum are long term closed
 You are clearer positively engaged and connect with other research Ive done reviewing the feild Keep up the great content I appreciate the videos you share with everyone",1
9o9loJpG-t4,"thank you im only 12 but this video rely helped me learn since ive been trying to find the salary 
I already know that i want to be an data anylist",0
9o9loJpG-t4,You came with receipts Alex,0
9o9loJpG-t4,Also how does she have a bunch of videos about being a data analyst yet SHE CANT EVEN INTERPRET DATA IN THE MOST BASIC OF WAYS,1
9o9loJpG-t4,She said median not mean  so the populationsample referenced is skewed somehow Or maybe she doesnt know what the median is,1
9o9loJpG-t4,"You are spot on For someone who is fresh from college this is spot on 
Where it gets grey is someone with a wealth of industry specific knowledge that is making a career change When you really understand what drives the data the corner cases that can only be learned from experience understanding the landscape cx executives partners psychology and having rock solid relationships Will get you quickly into this range However youll also be more of a senior equivalency but with entry tech skills",1
9o9loJpG-t4,Hello Alex I appreciate your videos I have watched the lady in your video on YouTube and I think I might be making a mistake I am looking to get into the data analytics field I am starting from scratch just learning Excel But I contacted her and she is charging me 250 for 1 hour of coaching to get started in this Field Is this a bad move and a waste of my money,-1
9o9loJpG-t4,Average salary  seems so broad Arent people really more concerned what is the average salary based on where I live Why would someone care what the total average salary for all 50 states is versus knowing the average salary for a data analyst in DallasFort Worth metroplex for instance  Hope this helps Is there a way to just narrow it to the area you live that is what most people want to know anyways,0
9o9loJpG-t4,I dont get why shes making it up even a 45k starting salary is pretty dam impressive,1
9o9loJpG-t4,well you did well by researching but i would have suggested you discuss it with her and let her make the corrections herself instead of coming out here to denigrate her reputationbesides you even said yourself that she made a mistakewho is above mistakes by the way,0
9o9loJpG-t4,She is such a troll I have been looking for information regarding DABA roles for a bit now and I realized that her videos provide absolutely no value whatsoever I have learned more from your resume review video alone than all her videos combined Thanks for providing honest information and ACTUALLY help people Just imagine having to work with her ehhhh,1

I have seen some of your videos and I am now in a transition stage in my current job I have had to analyze a large amount of data polish and clean it and I realy loved it but it is not one of my functions the company was recently in the need to generate a large amount of data related to machines I am a process engineer but thanks to that and also while talking with a friend who is a web developer I discover about Data Science and Data Analitycs Your videos are realy useful and thanks for sharing you experience",1
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex
Hope youre dowing well 
Im a student at human Genetics and Im very passionate about learning and getting into DS and DA but all i have basic knowledge of R and python
What can i do to become and expert in this field",0
wcKzdRVsMOw,I come from healthcare too EMT and currently live in NYCscared that there isnt going to be any jobs available by the time I learn basic data analyst roles My goal is to develop apps and programs and to be a software engineer and thinking data analyst would be a great stepping stone do you have any opinions on that Haha thank you,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Alex new subscriber I have a question So I am 38 I went to school for graphic design years ago But I am currently a painter at a school I just started and after a year I will get free tuition to any 12 state schools here in MD I really want to be a full stack developer but heard that it is much easier to get your foot in the door thru data So I guess I am asking for any advice I want to take advantage of free college a year from now But I am slowly teaching myself to code now I was learning HTML and CSS but just recently switched to SQL So yea any advice,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Im a computer systems engineering student and Im ready to be a data analyst intern however I cant find any intern position as of now I can only find internships for software developement Do you think that if I take the software developement internship it could be easy for me to transition to data analysis Ive seen a lot of similarities in the requirements for both positions,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Wow thank you for this video I did a bachelors of science and then did more specialized training in naturopathy but it was more of a passion than what I saw for myself as a career Throughout school I worked in fitness clerical and teaching Currently working as a Data administrator and thinking about what my next steps are to achieve my career and lifestyle goals At this stage of my life Im considering things I hadnt thought about in my 20s like salary projections career outlook and demand  level of challenge and portability  So far I was considering doing a Diploma in Health Information Management or Business Administration yet a school I spoke with suggested looking into Data Analytics And here your channel is Im so excited to watch and learn from you thank you,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex
I need your suggestion to switch my career into data science Im a Python developer with 2 years of experience basically into health care domain Im more interested in data analysis Could you help me out with suggestion how to change my career Should I have to apply for Entry level data analyst",1
wcKzdRVsMOw,it might be hard for the employers to make a solid assessment of the candidates when it come to data analytics skills during the interview  and if candidate claimed that he has all or the majority of the technical skills needed employer would feel doubtful about it,-1
wcKzdRVsMOw,So you just learned sql What resources did you use,0
wcKzdRVsMOw,Thanks for the Info I have done btech in mechanical engineering and i am planning to do masters in maths next With some sql grip would i be able to land a job at data analytics,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex

I have experience in Mainframes Technology and I had worked in a few projects where SQL was used but now I have 5 years of gap in my career due to some personal problem and I am exploring the new tech which I can learn to start my career again Here is my question I am not good in programming so it is fine to make career in Data Analyst And how long does it take to learn all the required skills to crack interviews to get the job",0
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex 

I did my engineering in Electronics and then pursued my MBA in Marketing and have been working in an Indian MNC as a Team Manager now the job that I do is redundant and straightoff boring as there are no technical skills involved except for a bit of Excel Also the money is really less

Anyhow  I have decided to switch over to Analytics as my career path because of my recent affinity towards numbersdataStatistics now because I have Zero knowledge in programming at the moment I am focusing heavily on brushing up my Statistical knowledge post which  I will be taking courses to learn SQL Python Tableau etc to land a job as a Junior DataMarketing Analyst and then progress slowly in the coming years towards becoming a Data Scientist obviously thats a little farfetched for now

So what would be your suggestion for me to secure my career transition Any advice would be highly appreciated 

Thanks in advance Alex

God bless you and your family
Much love and support from India",0
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex


I think that I really needed to see this channel because actually I feel stock in what Im doing right now Ive been working as a facilities manager for so long time and just tired of it 

I came to this channel to convince myself to search new knowledge and opportunities and I want to believe that analytics might be the way",0
wcKzdRVsMOw,I just found your channel  started to binge watch These video are amazing  Im currently a nurse and want to put in the work to switch careers for data analyst I just dont know how to look attractive to employers without a Bachelors in CS and only a AAS in Nursing  I plan on getting a SQL cert and making a website showcasing future projects like you suggested in the comments to someone else Not gonna lie though its very discouraging not having that piece of paper,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,How long did it take to get the grasp on SQL,0
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Great video Alex loved hearing you describe the interview process and that it can take a long time Very realistic but also reassuring

When you said you studied lots online to pick SQL skills what did you eventually put on your resume

Did you do any projects that you could use to show your actual skills
How did you decide that you had learned enough SQL to start applying for jobs",1
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex
I am trying to change my career into this field by selflearnBut on ground level I have been struggling with it for past two yearstill now I have struggled a lot to get proper SQL with data analysis tutorial I am currently into database programming mainly with SQL but with Analytical SQL  it is different 
 I can learn the basics of analytical SQL but I am finding it quite hard to get HANDSON with Analytic SQL like windows funcetc 
There is this one course in UDEMY where I have found the best course for SQL along with business Real use case for a data analyst  Advanced SQL  MySQL for Analytics and Business Intelligence 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ENOUGH TO USE OTHER FEATURES OF ANALYTICAL SQL IN TERMS OF BUSINESS USE CASE
Hope you feel free to give me some insight on this
Thank you very much",1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hello Alex I am Gulshan I finished 6 months data analytics course from SpringboardWorked on some projects using python SQL Excel power bi and now I am looking to get jobI domain is marketingand looking for entry level job in data analyticsplease help me what should I do because I lost my job in this pandemic,0
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey Alex Id like to ask how much time did it actually take you to prep for becoming a Data Analyst Did you have to leave your previous job If yes were the recruiters apprehensive about the break in your employment

Full disclosure Im a CS graduate who finished college last year and was working for one year as a junior tech writer I had to leave this job due to complications caused by COVID and now find myself at an impasse at my career While I have started working as sports writer just to get an income I am really looking to get into the Data Analyst profile but Im worried about having little to no experience and even though Ive started to read up on the latest technologies in the said field I realise that Ill need a few months to get the hang of it before I actually feel like I can work as an analyst in a corporate environment So its making me really anxious as to how badly the lack of work ex would affect me 

So effectively how many months can I give myself here before I make things complicated for myself Any response you could provide would be very very helpful for me

Please and thank you",0
wcKzdRVsMOw,Holy shit youre in Dallas Im in Fort Worth Currently taking an IBM data science course  had previously taken a course on Google sheets and fell in love with it so I thought Id take a shot at being a data analyst as Im between jobs right now Im also an artist and was thinking the domain knowledge would make me a good fit for something in entertainment Any advice on how to land something like that out here,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey Alex I cannot believe I found your videos on YouTube I was having such a hard time finding some real and relevant information on this subject as most of the people talk about data science 

Since youve been enough to offer you expertise in helping data analyst newbies I wanted to ask your opinion regarding my case I have been my whole life a travel specialist airfares and ticketing specialist and have no other experience whatsoever in data analysis Since the whole world changed during the past few months I am now looking for a second career and I have always wanted to work in this field but since I dont any education my bachelor degree is in philology or experience I always hesitated to try However I have already started learning Python a month ago and will focus on SQL also

Given your knowledge and experience in this field do you think I have any chance of getting a job after taking all the learning steps you recommended I have many communication and customer relations skills as well as working with many software related to my job 

Thanks a lot for proving all this extremely helpful information",0
wcKzdRVsMOw,Thanks for your honesty,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Big question Would working as a medical billing and coder be a good way to get my foot in the door in this career field Can it lead anywhere into the data analytics field I ask this because my VA VRR counselor is trying to sway me to go this route since the medical billing and coding program that my counselor would hook me up with also helps with job placement At least from here I figure I would be working and would have a budget to pursue a masters in data science,0
wcKzdRVsMOw,I can see that you have great experiences in your role can I ask what the next step is for data analyst as people always want to climb up the ladder  for example a data analyst in sales team for analytics how do they go to management  what is the long term goal for them,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey Alex Thank you so much for all your crystal clear information I have done the weirdest academic accomplishments My Bachelors degree is in Geography And I did MBA concentrated in MIS And now I want to become a data analyst so taking some online courses to get familiar with SQL and Pandas 

Im so sorry to ask you but do you see any hope that a company find me as a good candidate of entry level data analyst And Im 34 years old",1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Great video on your experience to your career change I was in your exact situation from transitioning to analytical roles Prior to that I was an engineer While the problem solving traits was an advantage the key is really embracing the tools that analysts use from research and selflearning Keep up the content,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi Alex  Thanks for the video It was inspiring Actually i also want to switch to data analyst profile from a different background I already started learning SQL python and has already done number of codes in both But i dont understand how to start the demo projects for data analysis Could you please guide me where to do the data analysis projects and what else do i need to practice before i start applying for data analyst jobs,1
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi Alex love your content Im in the web analytics side of things Google Analytics Tableau dashboards What are some good skill sets youd recommend I focus on Thank you,1

wcKzdRVsMOw,Hello Alex I am Punit Pandit I thinking of making a career switch from Electrical Engineer to Data Analyst I have just started up by taking Pyhton for dummies book as a course I greatly appreciate the online courses you shared in the description So I am an Electrical Engineering major from the beginning with no professional work experience whatsoever and by seeing the requirements for Data Analyst jobs I am getting a feeling that I do need to get enrolled in a Master in Data Science program What do you suggest,1

Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT
Honestlly I cannot tell you how much I hate people who wont shut up about their soft skill
I am a good leader
I am a hardworker
I am a master communicator
Well no shit Sherlock You are surely doing some master level of being a jackass
Seriously thank you Soft skills are called soft skills for a reason They are not something that can be shown It is something that can only be by how you carry yourself throughout work day in day out Not some lame excuse of why I should give you this job when you cant even do a simple Hello world code",0
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Hi Alex thanks for your contents In my experience there is no universal rules it depends on the country you live in In Italy for example the personal picture is almost mandatory The recruiters want your photo because they use it to remember you this is what they say,0
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Strongly recommend NOT using graphics such as charts to illustrate skill level Its highly subjective to the reader since 25 year senior software engineers 45 would be a 255 for a student and vice versa Plain and simple is the key,0
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Hi Alex I am trying to download the third resume template but it seems its no longer available Can you please share an alternative link,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Is data entry typing experience worth it to keep in resume for data analyst jobs,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Alex I believe your link 3 under GOOD Resume Templates above no longer works and must have changed on the hloom site  You can Download This Template directly  I found it on their site by navigating via the menu at hloomcom ResumeResume Templates then scrolling down to the Free Resume Templates section clicking link Basic Resume Templates and finding this template 3rd from the end of that collection  Im sure anyone could find it easily like me but thought Id let you know,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,When somebody has non IT experience and looking for job as data analyst do u think we should put the past experience,-1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,A big caution with a lot of the resume templates in this video is they all have some form of columns in how theyre formatted While they may look great to a recruiter or hiring manager once you get an interview most job applications are going to be submitted online and uploaded to an applicant tracking system ATS For those that utilize uploading an electronic document Word or PDF the ATS is going to have a hard time distinguishing different areas in columns This may result in have to clean up or simply enter manually all the information the ATS is looking for like contact information skills and work experience,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thank you for such a good resume update Video I just let my job recently now looking for job this will be great help,1

Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Hi Alex I have math and engineering degree but no related data analytics experience It seems almost impossible to get a first job as a data analyst,-1

Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"we would like to have a student version of this

Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thanks for the advice Would it be possible for you to create a video showcasing how to build your project portfolio Im making the switch to the data analysis field and know absolutely nothing about building a portfolio except that is a good way to showcase skills and experience Thank you,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,amazing super useful videos  what do you think about Microsoft certifications for SQL and Power BI Power pack are they really necessary for finding the first job or might be a help,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,I slightly disagree with the skill bar way of showing how proficient one is I saw a video from Joshua Fluke where he argues that different people use different parameters to evaluate their skills So what does a 75 filled bar mean How different is it from a 80 filled one How do you quantify this Also perhaps employers could look at a non100 filled bar and say if he is not even secure about his skill set why should we hire them or they might not see a 75 filled bar as enough even though your intention was to show you have a good grasp but still has some room to improve for example I dont know just felt like noting this because I like the concept and how it looks in the resume but I think the disadvantages of the interpretation behind it outweigh the advantages,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,According to on the resume expert we are supposed to have three resumes for three different purpose 1 For job boards Resumes are selected by recruiters with help of ATS scanners which uses frequency of keywords to select about top x ie 25 resumes This means a resume with more keywords with high frequencies has higher probability to be one of those x resumes That means it could be 4 pages long  2 For human When recruiters or HR contacts you send them a one page resume but very easy to read and follow 3 For job interview Take a single page resume but designed as a marketing material as presentation with key achievements I would appreciate your comments on them,1
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,I just completed online courses from Cornell to be certified in data analytics Would you put this certification in education experience skills or something else,0
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thanks for watching What is the weirdest thing you have or used to have on your resume I think mine was the granola company,1

4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hi Alex about Waterfall and Agile SDLC methodologies how do you need to understand them in order to claim that they are one of your skills I kind of understand the basic concepts but Im not sure if I really understand it enough to put them on my resume Do you have a good course recommended or this is something that relies more on experience thank you,1

4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hi I have a really important question is photo in resume good or bad,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hey Alex isnt this too much for a resume I was told one page maximum Queries are brilliant idea for a resume,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,I just finished the SQL tutorial for beginners all 4 videos and continuing to watch all your other videos as well I Appreciate your information and ability to explain to someone who is making that transition in their career For what its worth thank you so much for helping others,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hey Alex so Ive done SAS in a core module from my degree which has a lot of similarities with SQL Do you reckon it would still be useful to send examples of my code even if they dont ask for SAS as into many companies use it,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hello Alex do you think that sending a document with a script is better than giving a link to GitHubPortfolio in the Resume This is the first time I see someone sending actual code with the resume its cool but if I would get something like that my first question would be why the person doesnt just give a link to GitHub,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thank you,0
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hi Alex great video I am taking the Google Data Analyst Cert  to switch to data analysis whats the best way to find a job,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,The idea of simply sending some of your queries is genius Ill be using this in the future Thanks for such a useful video,0
4rfr6A3lO-Y,This is a gem content Alex I didnt know showing the queries you know would be beneficial Will try to add this in my next application  I wanted to ask if you also showed the result of the queries andor was asked about the data that you used,0
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Great video I have a question though I am from the humanities currently working on a History PhD Have you met analysts with PhDs in unrelated fields like mine considering they have managed to learn the necessary skills for the job Thanks,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hi Alex im business data analyst from Argentina and i love your videos This is the best video on YouTube for data analyst workers Thanks a lot,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex 
I was wondering your thoughts on including queries you wrote on your current companies database in your application Is this exposing potentially sensitive information even if you do not show the query results just the code Thanks",1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex
Very good video I learnt a lot from this short video I have been searching the web on Data analyst resume but did not see anything useful or I could relate to

But this video says everything in under 8 minutes Thank you so much

Another thing is the resume is very simple short and straight to the point",1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Great video Thanks for posting,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,wow  thank you so muchthis is really helpful But i have a small doubt I can only see the option of uploading resume on companys websites usually How can i attach those extra files like SQL queries and all while applying online to showcase our work please let me know i would be so thankful,0
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thanks for the video You might want to double check the most recent experience part where you mistakenly listed C as a language I think you meant C,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,The video is really educating but I am a fresher so wanted to know if you are going to make a video about how people like me can do to get a break as a data scientistanalyst,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,How do you feel about including online courses in your resume I  have 2 Nanodegrees from Udacity and does it hurt to put them in like a professional development section in your CV I have a bachelors and currently rounding up my Masters and looking to get a data analyst role And I live in Germany and resume of 2 pages is mostly recommended,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,i really wanna be an analyst can you make a video with what you need to be an analyst like what GPA you  need and what money you earn and how good it is,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,This is the most useful video Ive found on data analyst resume Thank you very much for sharing all of this publicly,1
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Where is the template,0
4rfr6A3lO-Y,The code example was good I include links to articles Ive written on analytics  my github I dont think anyone clicks on them Having the code physically in their face as an appendix to the resume seems like a better idea Issue Im finding in getting data analyst jobs is companies want someone resultsoriented but the HR filter is hard to bypass when HR asks for a bunch of software  tool skills Ive solved milliondollar problems at companies via analytics I have an MS in IS but I dont have 5 yrs experience in SAS R etc so dont get calls It feels humiliating,1

OTq2NRy_AGs,This is really interesting  I think I would love to start in a smaller company  because I am more interested in learning as much as I can at this stage Money will come later,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,You explain it well I had same experience,0
OTq2NRy_AGs,I would rather work at a BIG company,0
OTq2NRy_AGs,Hello at the age of 35 after having experience of about 12 years in small and mid size organization should I join big company for stability pay and experience Please advise,0
OTq2NRy_AGs,I definitely am open to either but I can see the benefit of having more access so that you are more efficient Working at a smaller company definitely gives you the chance to do every aspect of your role rather than it being divided by a larger team Benefits to both,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,Had the same experience I can endorse everything you said,0
OTq2NRy_AGs,Literally I relate to everything you mentioned I am also a Data Analyst and started my career in a small company as a Lead now I am in a huge company as an Analyst and I get paid more and have more benefits but my job status is lower,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,Great advice,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,I like your voice,0
OTq2NRy_AGs,Thanks,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,start from small company will have so many exposures,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,I think you hit the nail on the head with the differences The great thing about small companies that I enjoy is exactly what you said  the opportunity to learn multiple skills that you are less likely to get to know in a big company,1
OTq2NRy_AGs,"I currently work at a small company as a Data AnalystQA for an out of the box EDI Processing system

While my predominate role is data analysisQA Ive seen myself wearing a few hats
My first year I was doing general support as well for the department along with data analysis and QA
My second year Im seeing myself doing internaltest case development and more escalated support as it was recently established I would no longer do general support tickets and only take stuff on occasion

I personally like wearing a lot of hats as it helps me grow but Id like to work at a big company as well",0
OTq2NRy_AGs,Love it  I worked at a mediumish company which had been bought out by a larger company out of the country but they werent very involved in the daily business yet when i was there  I know EVERYTHING within a year  but was unable to get a promotion and eventually left for a family break  now im a contractor at a very large company and ive been there almost 6 months and feel like I know nothing  its also harder to get noticed for other roles because everyone is so overwhelmed all the time  theres definitely more potential to learn more skills at the larger company but i do miss knowing people,0

ya28cb3zFGE,Are you still in the states Nice story,1
ya28cb3zFGE,Wow  Thanks for your video  This sounds like my journey  I started as a mental health worker and trying to transition into a Program Analyst position at a hospital  This was very encouraging,0
ya28cb3zFGE,awesome content man Ive always wanted to go after this type of career but I always second guess or doubt myself Hearing your story gives me inspiration,1
ya28cb3zFGE,I took a Bootcamp program this March 2021 I learned 10 weeks of excel SQL and Tableau and 3 months later I found a job paying 75k  10 bonus it doubled my salary as I used to be a staff accountant I think Im extremely lucky that Im able to find an entrylevel job with such great compensation I live on the west coast,1
ya28cb3zFGE,Would it be reasonable to say that as a current business analyst with 7 years experience I can get a job as a data analyst quite easily I currently make 90k a year and would only accept a job that offers the same or more,1
ya28cb3zFGE,Alex will you conduct data analyst course,0
ya28cb3zFGE,thats awesome man Sounds like things worked out for you,1
ya28cb3zFGE,How and when did you learn your minimum ti even get the first good IT job I get the impression that you study IT stuff in college or maybe hi school,1
ya28cb3zFGE,"Waitso you just jumped over from doing unskilled labor to doing data analysis for them This was glossed over too quickly as it reveals a huge truth about getting a job Its more about WHO you know than WHAT you know

I assume your data analysis skills at the time were less than one would expect for an entrylevel person to normally get hired with but you were able to break into the data analysis field because they already knew and liked you And after that having some actual data analysis work on your resume gave you a huge legup in applying to other jobs via more traditional methods

Im just not convinced the data analysis field is all that good of an opportunity for most people It seems most data analysts either transition into the role in their current job or go through an internship as theyre wrapping up college Meanwhile people like me trying to start a new career are a dime a dozen people with just the basic skills and certifications being ignored by potential employers and drowning in a sea of competition

Whenever an entrylevel data analyst job opens up online within mere hours there are hundreds of applications already submitted It seems rather hopeless unless one happens to have a connection already with the company",1
ya28cb3zFGE,I have seen one of your video where you have discussed Udemy Courses Im on my way there Started with python,0

ya28cb3zFGE,Dallas resident here also love the content  Inspiring story and I feel I can relate what are some of your future goals  Glad I stumbled across your channel,1
ya28cb3zFGE,In my first job as a Data Analyst I was making 65k for a big company Now I have another job as a Data Analyst after two years and Im now making 50k for a smaller company The salary is low though in my opinion and I live in North Carolina,0

ya28cb3zFGE,About my career progression I went from insurance sales making 30k a year for 2 years to working at a call center sales for 5 years to landing a data analyst role unfortunately took a paycut for my first analyst role but I am making more money now that I have before Ive had 3 Data analyst positions the past 4 years with increasing salary with each one,0

ya28cb3zFGE,Your videos are always inspiring Im finishing my marketing degree and we havent seen too many things related to data tbh Id love to become a data analyst by the time Im 30 Im 21 right now I think Id have lots of great opportunities with a marketing degree Its a tough path to selflearn data analysis but it seems like its definitely worth it,1

ya28cb3zFGE,As they say is it necessary to learn r code and work on tableaucz Im thinking of a career in it,0
ya28cb3zFGE,Very similar to a path Im attempting to achieve I graduated with a masters degree in exercise science in 2017 Yes a boneheaded move on my part Why Exercise science is considered a useless degree by many and Im probably one of many that are living proof I made 16k in 2018 and a whopping 18k in 2019  Ive had had seven jobs the past three years with five of them paying at or near minimum wage Another job was personal training I could not sell my way out of a paper bag to make that gig work I also had a part time teaching job at a community college but was not selected for rehire the following year Now I have been selfteaching myself the skills needed to get into data science for the past year My goal is to gain an entry level data analyst job so I can build my skills more and put myself through college again to pursue a quantitative degree  Gaining an entry level data analyst job where I make even 40k would be like winning the lottery Earning 100k I might probably feel like I died and went to heaven Why I will be able to pay off my 100k student loan debt and start living life,1
ya28cb3zFGE,Would you say getting sql certified as a recent college grad would help me get my foot in the door for a healthcare analyst job,0

Do your supervisors generally understand the situation and are fine with submitting the work last minute 
Does it also make you feel stressed out that you wont be able to submit something on time because you waisted 3 days doing nothing and have everything left for the last few hours 
Are there days where you are just looking at the clock waiting to go home because you dont have anything to do or are you always working on multiple projects at the same time so there is always some deadline that you are focused on",0

6lQzbk6_OTw,"One thing to add is that there are many tools and if a person doesnt know Python then Power BI Tableau DOMO and Qlik are all great options for data visualizations 

I see more data scientists using R and Python but isnt a bad thing to learn There are well over 60 tools for data analysis and thats what makes it fun or frustrating lol Good vid",1

6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex
found your channel on Reddit and am grateful for your content
I am currently working as an analyst while waiting for September to start with my masters I am working in a startup here in Germany and anything is so vague and open which is good as I have a lot of freedom in my work but on the other hand theres a lot of pressure externally as well internally to do well and come up with great insights Currently I have been working on some projects by myself and sometimes I lack a little bit of creativity to come up with reasonable metrics and KPIs to measure Do you have any tips for generating insights How can I improve in that regard",0
6lQzbk6_OTw,Great video Alex I definitely agree that Excel and SQL is top 3 But do you think companies prefer an applicant with knowledge in a data viz tool Tableau Power BI or QlikView  over Python,1
6lQzbk6_OTw,Your thoughts on Google Sheets compared to Excel,0
