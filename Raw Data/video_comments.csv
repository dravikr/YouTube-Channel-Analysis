kk5zEOQzTmQ,I thought R was dying out
kk5zEOQzTmQ,"Like your R content.

Curious about your reasoning about sticking with RStudio instead of Positron"
kk5zEOQzTmQ,Great to see some love for R on the channel. Huge ggplot2 fan
kk5zEOQzTmQ,Can you do this using python
kk5zEOQzTmQ,This is for me. Thank you ❤
TP2OJuZhbIQ,Why the sound of your video is extremely low almost like muted
TP2OJuZhbIQ,"Real, nobody knows what's going on, not even the directors 😂"
TP2OJuZhbIQ,Sir in hindi translation
TP2OJuZhbIQ,Definitely. That’s why I like data analysis.
TP2OJuZhbIQ,"One thing that helped me think in the way Alex shows here was not treating work as school. By that I mean, sometimes we feel like a task at work is like taking a test, and if you fail to do it well, or can't do it by yourself and even if you don't know 100% of the answers, you'll ""flunk"" and get fired."
TP2OJuZhbIQ,"thank you ,right time to hear it."
TP2OJuZhbIQ,I needed to hear this today! Thank you!!
TP2OJuZhbIQ,"This is what made me follow you, Alex. You always keep it real!"
TP2OJuZhbIQ,It's cute
TP2OJuZhbIQ,Tackle as many problems as you can and learn that way - you’ll be the helpful coworker AND learn more along the way.
TP2OJuZhbIQ,Definitely didn’t learn how to normalize audio.
TP2OJuZhbIQ,"Haha, my parents told me thats most jobs. Especially tech, a lot of people are incompetent they said. Either yhe competent ones have imposter syndrome or start their own business which my dad runs"

Thank you so much Alex for this bootcamp, I have finally completed the courses, SQL was alottt🤣🤣.I have garnered so much knowledge from this bootcamp, Alex, you made data analysis so much easy to comprehend,thank you so much, just last week someone sent an hospital dataset for analysis and with the knowledge from Excel and Tableau from your bootcamp I was able to do the analysis. I got to know about github from you and I am already building my portfolio😊
However, I was not able to download the certificate from your github link, it is stating error.  please can you fix that, Thank  you Alex.

v5jasYkmwZI,"Hi,

I found the provided video to be highly informative and appreciate your effort. Thank you.

However, I am encountering an issue while importing an Excel file into R, specifically with converting dates in the format dd-mm-yyyy. Despite utilizing the lubridate library and the parse_date_time() function, some dates are not being converted correctly.

Upon further investigation with AI tools, I discovered that Excel stores dates internally as numbers, and the date column may contain mixed data types (numbers and text). This inconsistency leads to issues during date conversion in R, as some values are imported as numbers (Excel serial dates) while others are imported as text.

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue."
v5jasYkmwZI,Talk about GPT-5 please and its implications on data analysis
v5jasYkmwZI,"hey @alex ur referral code ""R"" is not working"
v5jasYkmwZI,"Thank you so much. 
Quick one, why did the result take up Y-M-D by default?  
Can it be parsed to another format?"
v5jasYkmwZI,"Thanks so much, this is so helpful"
kqhJff8ruKw,I’ve had a recruiter reach out to me. I wasn’t interested in the job so I gave them a name. That person ended up getting a job. This was in the fitness and wellness industry but it reflects what you’re talking about in this video.
kqhJff8ruKw,100% agree with Alex here. Working on IT for 5 years I noticed that we don’t directly even utilize LinkedIn or Indeed as much anymore since the pandemic. Mostly through internal and external recruitment now.
kqhJff8ruKw,Is there a video that you've put out that basically goes through how to do this?
kqhJff8ruKw,This was the only thing that was working for me. Even though I didnt get any offers it got me interviews and met people who were really interested in me.
kqhJff8ruKw,Even applying for jobs now is a complicated hustle.
kqhJff8ruKw,"I am applying for the past 7 months and and got only 1 interview. i applied more than to 7k jobs and updated my resume for 200$, nothing works. I reached out to Recruiters internally , didnt work. I am frustrated"
kqhJff8ruKw,What about the AI job market now ? AI is on the trench now ?
kqhJff8ruKw,Sir can ai replace data analyst roles please reply sir
kqhJff8ruKw,I always do this and they never get back to me. The whole job market is dead.
kqhJff8ruKw,The job market is so screwed right now. So glad I started my own business and don’t have to deal with all this BS
kqhJff8ruKw,How to reach out to a recruiter and where to find one ?
kqhJff8ruKw,Wow!!!! Yo I’ve applied for over 400 jobs in two weeks man and not ONE has hit me back. Thanks for the advice man.
kqhJff8ruKw,Can you please help me Alex ? Which course you recommend for  using Python in SQL ?
kqhJff8ruKw,It is difficult to get a job in IT sector
kqhJff8ruKw,"One tip I heard is to apply to posted jobs within the first few hours.

I was thinking your advice is very true but it would be hard to accept for a person in data analysis since they are logical thinkers. I learned the hard way that the world of work isn't a meritocracy based on decision makers making rational decisions."
kqhJff8ruKw,Thanks Alex really helpful
kqhJff8ruKw,"Really great tips, but what the heck is up with the saturation in this video, Alex? Haha!"
kqhJff8ruKw,I just got a job as an installed base/market intelligence manager at ABB by applying through LinkedIn. I live in Sweden and it was my 12th job application after graduating from college. It worked for me.
kqhJff8ruKw,How to contact a recruiter
kqhJff8ruKw,"That kind of job hunting is actually common in my country and it is called the ""Backer System"". The person inside the company that is helping is called ""Backer"". It is common and it is toxic 😂"
kqhJff8ruKw,Do you have any advice how to do that as a recent graduate where you don’t have a lot of experience
kqhJff8ruKw,I’m assuming applying traditionally would be the best towards local areas that don’t have company websites and uses indeed
kqhJff8ruKw,"The use of recruiters, at all, is baffling to me. Stop using foreigners to recruit your employees. Stop hiring foreigners exclusively through recruiters who are foreigners themselves. Im american. I want to speak to an american when i apply at an american company. Why is a foreign 3rd party involved in this process at all. It seems like a huge scam. Tax breaks perhaps? 🤷"
kqhJff8ruKw,How do i get in contact with third party recruiters for someone who's in Africa
QR8kxf925IQ,"help , you send the advanced SQL but some tables are missing"
QR8kxf925IQ,"Hi everyone,
I’m a career changer trying to break into data analytics. I’ve been looking for “data analyst” jobs, but I’ve noticed there are so many different kinds of analyst roles, and most of them don’t even require SQL or Python — the skills needed really depend on the specific type of analysis.

I’m really struggling to find true entry-level data analyst positions, whether local or remote.
Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
QR8kxf925IQ,"Just wanted to let you know I didn’t even get an interview for the DA job in my office , but after getting half way through your tableau course on analyst builder . It has brought my dashboards to a complete different level . I’m excited to learn more as I try to gain more knowledge through your site . Also I have begun posting my services for free on Craigslist and Facebook to get real world portfolio projects.  I don’t have many people to tell all this to so yeah lol."
QR8kxf925IQ,Where should I start?
QR8kxf925IQ,Have you got a email ? what is the better communication tools ? whats app ?

PqCp1f0RIaU,Nobody likes Power Bi 😂
PqCp1f0RIaU,"Struggling with dax

PqCp1f0RIaU,"Dont be afraid to fail-it is the beginning of wisdom. Start with Power BI, and crave the hardest part. I guarantee you this-you will never regret this as soon as you grasp Aaron Parry's well crafted professional lectures. Dont mind this brother with bad bald head. He wants you to get stuck so you could come to his not so good explanation of SQL. A child start by figuring out to walk, then later speak his first word.

PqCp1f0RIaU,Does that apply to tableau as well ?
PqCp1f0RIaU,"i learnt Alex the Analyst data analyst boot camp course during end of 2024-and start of 2025, it was easy at first, now i'm doing Excel with copilot in coursera (started may 1st, 2025 with coursera + subscription) and struggling with advanced data processing in excel, the graded projects takes atleast 1 week to finish and finished 2/4 - fundamentals and data cleaning, currently at advanced data analysis, what i'm saying is excel is not as easy as you think, especially the data cleaning, data interpretation and data reporting parts, basic pivot tables are easy but i learnt how to make multi-filter pivot table after refering so many youtube and udemy tutorial videos (i actually use these advanced excel tricks at office everyday as practice)....yes need to start with Excel first and Statistics alongside because lots of statistics are involved in actual advanced Excel with copilot in coursera, then SQL, then Python and/or R before hitting powerBI"

_YG8b1g-QJA,"Makes sense for sure, even if it's a tough break earlier on. Also, wonder how much this is a function of domain knowledge or lack thereof in the beginning? I know some industries are more ""parochial"" when it comes to domain knowledge than others, in terms of picking it up and allowing some leeway for the learning curve. Finance seems to be one of those tougher domains in that regard in fact. You pretty much have to learn domain at the same time as you're learning data analytics and that's beyond daunting unless you started out in business or finance and you're adding data instead of both at the same time."

I have a question:
What is the difference between
z <- 10

z = 10?

When I use <-, it works the same as =, and = also seems to work fine. So why don’t we always use = instead?"
O5nQKzBb0oc,Is it possible to get a job in data analysis without a degree?
73S2SJSTgQU,Greetings would you be able to do a video on fitting distribution on RStudio or if anyone can recommend a creator that has done it
73S2SJSTgQU,<33333333333
73S2SJSTgQU,"Siempre que sea en español,"
73S2SJSTgQU,I hope that you will create a comprehensive training course on data analysis and that it will be up-to-date and keep pace with the changes.
73S2SJSTgQU,"Hi Alex,

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been following your content on YouTube for quite a while now — you’re actually one of the key reasons I broke into the data analytics field without a university degree in CSE or Data, so first off, thank you for the inspiration and practical guidance.

I’ve been working as a data analyst here in Berlin for the past five years, but to be honest, I’ve been struggling lately with a growing fear that our role as data analysts might become obsolete due to AI and automation. With the pace things are moving, it sometimes feels like it’s just a matter of one or two years before our entire skill set is automated away — and that uncertainty is weighing on me heavily.

Since you’re someone I look up to in this space, I wanted to ask for your honest perspective: where do you see the future of data analysis going with AI evolving so quickly? Do you think there’s still a sustainable path ahead in this field, or should I seriously consider switching careers?

I’d truly appreciate any thoughts or advice you’re willing to share — even (or especially) the brutally honest ones.

Thanks again for all the value you’ve created for the community.

Best Regards from Germany,
Saif Saduddin"
73S2SJSTgQU,Thank you Alex!
73S2SJSTgQU,"Thanks a lot, I awaited for this video. I know you can make it as easier as possible"
73S2SJSTgQU,Sweet one. Will be following. I love R. Simple to use. Encountered it in the Google DA course.
73S2SJSTgQU,"Cool. Also, anticipating projects in R too or maybe Excel + R. Something like that!"
TsnGd6p9oTk,I just went back to studying R when I open your channel to find this series. What a timming
TsnGd6p9oTk,"thanks god Alex, i had been struggling to learn R for quite sometime. now i can understand better."
TsnGd6p9oTk,"Wow, exactly what I am looking for 
So many data analytics channels on YT but nobody teaches ""R"", all I can find is some old irrelevant content.

Thank you so much for teaching it from scratch!"
TsnGd6p9oTk,When are rest of the videoes going to be released?
TsnGd6p9oTk,tank you😍😍😍
TsnGd6p9oTk,"Great timing, Alex. Been thinking of learning R for a while now, especially since a professor friend of mine wants me to study it if I want to help him out with research"
TsnGd6p9oTk,Hi Alex I hope your doing great your content is very good many more exciting videos from your end ❤
TsnGd6p9oTk,"Currently I am started studying the Data Analytics course from your channel and I am at Subqueries in Intermediate level, its feel easier to understand from your channel and I need to practice. Can you help me to find the platform from where I can practice to learn more."
TsnGd6p9oTk,"Thank you, I was expected at least one operation using R that might be helpful to compare with the known skills of mine or others..."
TsnGd6p9oTk,R for data analytics is exactly what I've been waiting for on this channel. I'm excited for this.
TsnGd6p9oTk,Definitely looking forward to learn from you. It's the first time I am hearing about this language and it sounds exciting already!
TsnGd6p9oTk,You deserve Respect sir ❤
DsI1vG-kXR8,I'm also IBM and Google certified data analyst.
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Do you have a degree, Alex?"
DsI1vG-kXR8,Is datacamp free? Or do we need to pay for the courses? Ive seen some of their courses and they look good but I've also heard you need to pay.
DsI1vG-kXR8,In coursera you have now better course than ibm or google ... they are famous so i suppose its  force to do partnership with them but not really reliable
DsI1vG-kXR8,What about Google data analytics?
DsI1vG-kXR8,"I am in my own challenge of completing all of the courses on Analyst Builder. 
So far I am loving the platform, Alex is a great guy, approachable and trustworthy."
DsI1vG-kXR8,My goal is I want to become a data analyst. I want an opportunity to improve my skills .
DsI1vG-kXR8,"what if someone has 3 years gap and belongs to commerce background? , will he get a job?"
DsI1vG-kXR8,Sir would you sugess any paid course for data analytics
DsI1vG-kXR8,I tried learning sql through youtube and ibm and googles data analytics certificates but gave up. I began learning sql using chatgpt and its hands down the best way to go. Instead of watching boring videos all my learning is hands on. I download mysql bench and get a dataset from kaggle and have chatgpt ask me sql interview questions and then i paste my queries and chatgpt will tell me what i did right and wrong. By far been the best teacher and its free.
DsI1vG-kXR8,analystbuilder site isnt working
DsI1vG-kXR8,Thanks for your information
DsI1vG-kXR8,"I just paid your courses Monday, for data analytics, Im happy so far … thank you"
DsI1vG-kXR8,"“Hi Alex, which would you recommend for learning SQL: DataCamp or Udemy?”"
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Reddit, Ai (chat gpt), kaggle, data camp, YouTube (luke barose, Agatha, mo chen)"
DsI1vG-kXR8,"You are best instructor ever Alex!, would you mind develop basic analytics course that cover everything from excel, python, SQL, tableau, and Power Bi free for beginners"
DsI1vG-kXR8,"kaggle
reddit
data camp"
DsI1vG-kXR8,Data with Baraa is also good.
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Plz , want playlist about how integrate data with ai 
Gor example automation for dashboatd with some libraries in python 
or vanna ai (and apply  NLP)"
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Hi Sir, I am your big fan. Please create a complete course of Data Analytics covered with MS Power Bi & Tableau. 
We are your students. We are your followers. It's a humble request for you. I hope you will complete our wish."
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Without watching the clip, let me guess (in no particular order): DataCamp, Udemy, Alex’s platform, Freecodecamp, coursera

All the usual ones?"
DsI1vG-kXR8,Hi Alex I hope your doing good love❤ you
DsI1vG-kXR8,Side note… I use chatgpt and Googles AI studio for business analyst tasks like SOPs and business requirement docs. If you feed the system what your project entails.. asking random questions here and there. Once you ask that real troubleshooting question they’ll understand your specific needs a lot better. I’m sure most of us know this but just adding it for those who may not.
DsI1vG-kXR8,Alex how is chandoo yt channel for data analysis
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Please, teach us dynamic web scraping..."
DsI1vG-kXR8,You are a life saver ❤
DsI1vG-kXR8,"Udemy Courses are the best ,"
DsI1vG-kXR8,4th comment
DsI1vG-kXR8,Coursera left the group chat?
DsI1vG-kXR8,What do you think about datawars?

4lhPHhPkVLM,"Hi Alex, thanks for the video, I have a question, beside your amazing recommendations here, is it correct that services like Azure Fabric are going to kill Tableau and PowerBI, because it's cloud native and more advanced? 
I have full access to Azure at work, as a DevOps engineer, and I can practice Fabric, what do you think?"
4lhPHhPkVLM,"Hi Alex it is a request if you could also make a video on ""how to reset root password in SQL, when someone forget one"" 

Love Love from India.. 🤍🌷"

Thanks"
4lhPHhPkVLM,What do you think of Metabase as a starting point for data visualization?
4lhPHhPkVLM,"First of all, thsank you so much for your unwavering contribution to the data community. If you are noticing my comment, can you make a video on covering the Dynamic Web Scraping. I was very excited to learn more into your A.B. but it's limited to only static. I request you to give at least a guideline because you are the only person who can make learning as easier as possible."
4lhPHhPkVLM,"is there any way sir, you can offer subscription in the Website for free like Data Camp ? I really want to know in depth the field"
4lhPHhPkVLM,Great recommendations. Thank you Alex
4lhPHhPkVLM,Will data visualization gets replaced by ai?
4lhPHhPkVLM,"Am an accounting student love my filed but love data analysis too their definitely is something with both being in I believe, can you try and explore that side for us?"

If you could make a detailed video on this topic, I believe it would help many people especially those actively preparing for Business Analyst, Data Analyst & Power BI Developer roles by giving them a better understanding of real-time market requirements."

kagUDLvrcZ8,"It's been a while since I've used Coursera, but they used to have an Audit option where you could take the class for free, with some restrictions (couldn't do the tests, and a few other things). I think they probably still have that option, but it's not really advertised"
kagUDLvrcZ8,What about the PCEP and PCAP courses on OpenEDG?

dStNNjOKML4,Is there any resources for practicing high level domain based questions.Any websites?
dStNNjOKML4,Hello Alex can you create port foil project for powe bi
dStNNjOKML4,"Hi Alex! I just wanted to say that I just got hired as a Data Analyst, I'm starting on June. I thank you for the majority of it, I watched a lot of your guides and tutorials. I started practicing around 2023, though I have a degree of programming as an IT graduate, it is still different from data analysis. I took the Google Data Analytics course from Coursera, and started applying.

In my country, they don't honor the certificate but my advise for those aspiring Data Analyst is practice what you've learned and keep making portfolios. After 2 years of rejection from my applications, I was lucky enough that they hired me and was astonished with the things I learned. Do not ever lose hope if you really wanted to become one, always strive to learn and improve.

So thank you Alex! Thank you very much!"
dStNNjOKML4,Thanks so much Sir
dStNNjOKML4,"Alex can you extend the promo for 30% few days more. 
Thank you"
dStNNjOKML4,Fantastic
dStNNjOKML4,"Bro I'm done with data analytics. I've commited countless hours, literally solved every possible quetion there is either on AnalystBuilder/Leetcode/Stratascrach both on Python and SQL. And the only replies on my email are either to reject my CV or completely ghost me. Two years of sending CVs daily and practisting / making personal projects and I havent even got an interview so I can prove my skills and my passion for data science. I'm done with this industry. It's all a big lie!"
dStNNjOKML4,"Congrats Alex, this is really cool. I feel that weirdness of the interviews just by reading the questions lol. YES to the mockup interviews too!"
dStNNjOKML4,"Hi! I love your content. Just wanted to say if you ever need a video editor to make your YouTube videos pop, I’d love to help. I can even edit 1 video for free so you can see my work!"
dStNNjOKML4,"Analyst Builder is getting bold day by day. I like it's simplicity and intuitiveness fully. However, waiting for discounts on other packages as well. Thank you for your continuous dedication."
dStNNjOKML4,We need subtitles in other languages ​​on Analyst Bulder. Please.
dStNNjOKML4,Been trying to login from Nigeria but cannot. Please what's wrong with the site?

OQM9x6E3ojo,Surveys are definitely sketchy. They never tell you their method for selecting participants.
OQM9x6E3ojo,I don't want to lie with data

z39SB95JbDo,ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS SERIES.
z39SB95JbDo,😂
z39SB95JbDo,say with me now correlation doesn't imply causation...
z39SB95JbDo,"Hello Alex, I don’t agree with you that shark attacks aren’t related to ice cream sales. When a shark attack happens, people stop swimming, feel stressed, and start buying more ice cream!😂"
z39SB95JbDo,You are so good that Chatgpt recommended you. I just want to learn data analysis on YouTube before going for training that would certify me
z39SB95JbDo,"While someone might try to rationalize it by saying 'Well, higher temperatures mean more people buy ice cream, AND those same higher temperatures mean more people go to the beach where sharks are, so naturally both go up together!' – that elaborate explanation still doesn't mean ice cream causes shark attacks, or vice versa. It just shows how easy it is to build a story around a correlation that has a completely different underlying cause (in this case, the temperature/season). Always gotta watch out for those tempting but ultimately misleading rationalizations!"
z39SB95JbDo,"The increase in temperature have a positive correlation with shark attack, also,  increase in temperature will also have a direct correlation with the ice cream sales."
z39SB95JbDo,"I'm a product manager, this rings true when I'm verifying data outputs provided by an analyst that clearly didn't understandstand how a product works😅"

z39SB95JbDo,I’m new here bro this is my first video I hope I learned a lot about data ❤

W5CQb7klLCs,"Hi Alex, I’m a recent fintech graduate and I’m looking to break into the data analytics space . I would appreciate any help or advice you can offer"
W5CQb7klLCs,Please include Brazilian Portuguese audio in your bootcamp videos it will help a lot
W5CQb7klLCs,Used to work in advertising and it was always entertaining when networks would tell us about their #1 rated show. Nearly every single one had an astrik and it would #1 rated with Males between 18-34 on tuesdays for the 8pm timeslot. You could tell they cherry pick through to see which demo they were #1 in.
W5CQb7klLCs,How did I miss this video posted over three hours ago!????
W5CQb7klLCs,"Hi Alex sir I'm very poor student but i want to learn data analysis course iam so exicted to learn with you sir. Can u provide and help free resources for data analysis modules like pathetics statistics, Excel, python, power bi, Tableau help me sir can u provide any free resources"
W5CQb7klLCs,The White House social during the pandemic was a masterclass. But they supposed they had to do it.
W5CQb7klLCs,"Yeah I always too check how the data is presented. Many times also the differences are exaggerated wildly by making a 1% or something change span the whole chart.. like starting from 55% from bottom and the top is 56%, what a huge increase! Sadly many don't understand to look more closely and only will see a big bar next to a tiny one and read the headline."

xb5-UX-jYw0,"This video is Awesome, Thanks for sharing"
xb5-UX-jYw0,Yep! we definitely need to normalize using the Median instead of the Average when it comes to representing something.
xb5-UX-jYw0,"Data and perspective play together , you can tell someone is  correctly wrong and still be able to defend it with the data from another perspective 😂. 

This video was helpful, thanks for sharing"
xb5-UX-jYw0,I really like this series
xb5-UX-jYw0,"These videos make me excited to study data analytics, well, more intensely than my current pace. I've been slacking off lately.

And I already got a few ideas for practical exercises, though it will be pain to scrape all the needed data manually. But the results will be worth it, I reckon"
xb5-UX-jYw0,Thanks for provide me alot information
xb5-UX-jYw0,"Each number has been divided by population.  Since the population is different, you can't average the two numbers.  Also collection method, definition of salary etc. is ALSO probably different for each state, so..."

V3ouFOBQP0k,I LOVE YOU AND YOUR CHANNEL.
V3ouFOBQP0k,"This is fantastic, thank you for making this series!"
V3ouFOBQP0k,"This is a great video, keep it up."
V3ouFOBQP0k,"Thanks for this great video. I have a question. If the percentages were still within the range shown in the video and I had baseline numbers in the hundreds of thousands or millions, would it bbe possible to still represent all the values in one graph? - I know the percentages will be really small bars if not invincible bars so how would you represent them in one graph.

Also, given the same condition as earlier explained, would you say it's better to separate them into two graphs, one for percentages and the other for the baseline numbers."
V3ouFOBQP0k,I don’t like the graph that you constructed. It mixes percentages and numbers on the same unlabeled Y axis. that is not good.
V3ouFOBQP0k,How should i work on domain knowledge? For example Finance or Marketing domain.
V3ouFOBQP0k,I always love your content
V3ouFOBQP0k,"Not finished with this yet, but this is so good. I'm a Senior DA, and we often have inexperienced analysts making the simplest mistakes. One of the common ones I see is averaging an average."

5n52mlp9Ym0,Whoever gets this deal will be lucky. I have Alex's lifetime already. Hopefully Maven has a deal coming soon so i can get his lifetime platform too. Love both you guys.

5n52mlp9Ym0,Sounds wonderful!
5n52mlp9Ym0,"Hi Alex! Been follower of your Bootcamp, and that playlist has become my go-to resource for learning about becoming a DA.
Funny story though - while ""Data Analyst"" isn't my official title, I actually landed a role as an EA of a new company for 7 months now. Surprisingly, the data analysis knowledge I gained from your vlogs has been incredibly useful! I've even been able to provide data-driven suggestions to other departments. 😂
So, just wanted to let you know that my time learning from your content has definitely not been a waste! Keep up the great work! Thank you!"
5n52mlp9Ym0,hit me up if anyone wants to collab on this. lol

5n52mlp9Ym0,"Some of us are from developing countries, paying in dollars is just too hard. I hope this opportunity helps someone though"
5n52mlp9Ym0,"I have been working in Data Analytics for the last 4 years and I am sure I could have found other resources had these 2 not been around but Alex and Maven have been my MAIN source of learning as I have grown, up skilled, got promoted... So to see the possibility for anyone to get both platforms in one is AMAZING!! Bummer I can’t access it as I already have lifetime access to Maven."
5n52mlp9Ym0,What a great initiative. Really hope folks will be able to take advantage of it 📈
5n52mlp9Ym0,"Great initiative! 
Hope to purchase in the near future 😊"

5n52mlp9Ym0,Great News
5n52mlp9Ym0,Hi Alex is there a way to pay this fee monthly?
5n52mlp9Ym0,"This is huge Alex. Nice collab! Your platform is one of the best for hands-on practice and Maven is really good design-wise. They also have a portfolio page option inside their platform, so 👍 Thanks. I'll see if I can allocate money for this"

5n52mlp9Ym0,I purchased a lifetime membership for Analyst Builder last year. What happens to my membership with this merger?

hgp91KvbJV4,So this is the basic entry course for anybody at the IPCC huh
hgp91KvbJV4,I'm looking for a mentor!
hgp91KvbJV4,love this guy I have his signature 🫡
hgp91KvbJV4,"Sir, can you teach some statistics that are used in data analytics?"
hgp91KvbJV4,Thanks Alex!
hgp91KvbJV4,"Hey Alex! Thanks for the useful tips, minute changes can make a big impact."
hgp91KvbJV4,"In terms of axis, how do you make it dynamic when you are using a slicer. I feel like I have this problem when using slicers and the axis are having very wide and varying numbers"
hgp91KvbJV4,Bias is really something companies must tackle
hgp91KvbJV4,"Thank you for this! Not only is this helpful in making sure that we are truthful in our data visualizations, but it really helps spot data manipulation in our day-to-day lives!"
hgp91KvbJV4,"such videos foster critical thinking, love it :)"
hgp91KvbJV4,Everytime you show up with the real contents. Thank you so much
hgp91KvbJV4,"With that kind of sales data, I think it's better to look at Percent change year by year, instead of actual sales values. If we know we're projected to always increase sales, most likely, that company is targeting a % increase goal, not a value but a percentage. 

Data is only useful if there's something actionable from it, and in the sample's case, increasing sales doesn't really tell you much, and it actually ""lies"" by showing you that everything's doing great because it's trending upwards. If you look at % increase year by year, at 2016 they increased sales by 4%, but it actually started going down up to ~1.6% in 2024, which may indicate that they need to be more aggressive in selling"
hgp91KvbJV4,Unpopular but a popular insight and truth. Thanks 😅
hgp91KvbJV4,"Watching this, and all I can think of is Apple marketing how much better their M chipsets are, every year 😆"
hgp91KvbJV4,"Small change but a huge difference!
Thanks for sharing, Alex!"
hgp91KvbJV4,I was watching a sports podcast and one member got called out for making a table in the first manipulate way

1ql4kNv0_qY,Thank you so much for this Alex! I knew about Data.gov but the open source EHR system is definitely a hidden gem 💎🙌🏽
1ql4kNv0_qY,Great video - this opens so much - I watched your Azure Analytics Services video - would that be appropriate place to load some of this data to process before visualizations?
1ql4kNv0_qY,"Congrats Alex on the 1M+ on You tube. For these sources mentioned, do we have to worry about getting approvals before hosting the data on our portfolios or does only referencing suffice?"
1ql4kNv0_qY,"That is insightful, sir
kindly prepare a boot camp for health data analytics for your audience.
Thanks in advance"
1ql4kNv0_qY,Alex the amazing 😅

1ql4kNv0_qY,"Hi Alex, Could you please do a video on EHR systems and how one can work with them, I didnt get what you said about it in this video. You seemed to mention it in passing, Thanks."
1ql4kNv0_qY,Thanks
1ql4kNv0_qY,"Hi  Alex,

Congratulations! I have a question about becoming a healthcare data analyst. I have a bachelor’s degree in healthcare informatics and am considering pursuing a master’s in AI and machine learning.

XuOcmjIbFGg,That looks like a nightmare to clean up 😂
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Hi Alex, can i ask where did you obtain the claims dataset?"
XuOcmjIbFGg,Where did you get your claims dataset from? I appreciate the github link but where was it from originally?
XuOcmjIbFGg,Can you please do a project about healthcare using this type of data? That would be super helpful!
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Out of college just started posting on linkedin (i think for 1 month now) and a recruiter from a healthcare insurance company actually messaged me for a contract position, and I find this extremely helpful thank you!"
XuOcmjIbFGg,Loving this series
XuOcmjIbFGg,This is aaaaamazing 👌👌. Thanks a million.
XuOcmjIbFGg,"you need a separate channel for this, there are close to no channel that goes in dept like you do in healthcare analysis. also, can a pharmacy technician be a healthcare analyst?"
XuOcmjIbFGg,What type of projects/dashboarding/insights did you work with for the claims data and the drugs products data!
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Alex when you do your videos can you give us more details on the type of reporting that you did, how you cleaned the spreadsheets etc like in a real work environment. That would be a great value add."
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Brother, who is manipulating you, they might be interested in your loss. Already targeted lots of people with their psychological attacks and destroyed them by looting, abusing, and attacking. This group uses lots more other platform, techniques and tects to abuse."
XuOcmjIbFGg,Hey guys .. Can we crack beginner level interview with alex data bootcamp course
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Thank you, Alex. This video is really useful."
XuOcmjIbFGg,Interesting😊
XuOcmjIbFGg,For US based it's better to focus on ICD-10-CM since ICD-11 is years away for the market. It was over 20 years from when WHO upgraded 9 to 10 for the US to develop and go live with the 10. Could be the same for 11. The US always adopts it's own version. I'm not sure how this will change any more now that the US dropped out of the WHO.
XuOcmjIbFGg,I’ve been working on the clinical side of healthcare for the last 13 years have some interviews this week lined up for the data analysis roles. Thank you for these extra information
XuOcmjIbFGg,How can i work for you as a Thumbnail editor?
XuOcmjIbFGg,"i love your videos. i have learned a lot from them.i was just wondering is there a book or resource that you would recommend to learn sql, intermeddiate to advanced sql, with stuff like ctes, indexing, temp tables etc. idk. i feel like i know only the basic crud and aggregate functions in sql. also preferably postgres?"
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Thank you for keeping updating the series. I am following you with each video and learn a lot . I believe i didn't see ICD 11 here in Egypt yet though. 
Your lovely Egyptian pharmacist 😁💙"
XuOcmjIbFGg,You have increased my appetite. Could you pls make a complete playlist to be a Health Care Analyst.
XuOcmjIbFGg,Where can one find some good dummy claims data like the one shown in the video?  Also is ICD11 in wide use or is ICD10 still the most widely used?
XuOcmjIbFGg,I have been waiting for this video since the 1st Healtcare Analyst video. Looking to pivot from Health Insurance to Healthcare Analyst.
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Most major companies are still using icd10 codes, just fyi"
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Been correcting claims for HCA for 15 years on the revenue cycle side. I was looking to make to move out of production and into analytics, but wasn't sure how. These vids came at the perfect time. Thank you"
XuOcmjIbFGg,"Thank you 
I am a medical student
I still dont understand how can i use data analysis for my jop
I mean is the data we use as a doctors will be different !
As a doctor what's your advice to be a data analysis,"
XuOcmjIbFGg,Would you do a video for finance?
XuOcmjIbFGg,Under 2 minutes gang ? 👍🏽
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I've been a certified medical coder for the last 8 years. I'm eager to learn to become a healthcare analyst and I think my coding background and EHR knowledge will be a huge asset. Looking forward to what lies ahead!
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hello,

I have over 20 years of experience in healthcare and am interested in becoming a clinical data analyst. I would appreciate it if you could add some clinical data sets to your Excel, PowerBI, and SQL series so that we can gain real-world data experience."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Im in spd
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Can anyone share a dataset that includes all the things he mentioned? I am trying to create a healthcare analytics project, but a dataset with ICD11 code and CPT code seems like an impossible task."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"I am in healthcare over 15 years. I know what you’re talking about. I use epic also EMR.
I’m ready to move to the Healthcare data analyst"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hello, I am currently a certified medical coder. Do you think it would be easy for me to become a  healthcare analyst?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I'm a nurse with 20 years of experience finishing my MSN in Informatics.  I'm also working on the Google Data Analytics Certificate.  How can I break into analytics with those skills and credentials?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"My current job title is Data Specialist. I have 2 years in that role. Prior to that, I was under the title of operations Coordinator for 7 years.. but with the same duties hence them changing my title. Prior to these roles, I was in data entry for 1 year. Ive been with the same company (mail order pharmacy) for 10 years. Do you think this is enough experience to seek out the data analyst roles?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"I'm a medical coder,  started working in Epic in 2012."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,can a healthcare analyst work in a fully remote role?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I recently got hired as a BI Analyst / Reporting Specialist for a Medical Billing Insurance company. Since I'm new to the field it can be overwhelming on the data processing and claims procedures. You got any tips where I can learn more about the industry?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Applied and interviewed for a health analyst role! Hope I get it next week 🙏
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I just need a job. Why is it so hard to get my first full time job in tech?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,How can I get epic certification   if I'm not affiliated with any organization
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Thank you so much for this. I am a medical coder in 🇨🇦 working using Epic daily, and I am looking into health information analyst roles."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hi Alex. Does it help to obtain AHIMA'S CHDA credential? I have been a medical coder for 11 years so I have plenty of experience with EPIC and other EHRs. Dealing with burnout in coding, so I'm ready to move onto something else the data analytic field."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Is there a difference between working as a Data/Business Analyst for a hospital in their IT department vs working as a Data/Business Analyst in a hospital but more Healthcare focused. I worked as a data analyst intern for a hospital for a year and most of my work was related to IT not anything to do with healthcare data or detailing with EHR or anything like that. How can I find these healthcare related roles?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I used to work in clinical research when i was trying to go for PA school. But now trying to transition into healthcare analytics. thanks for the video.
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I've been wanting to become a healthcare/clinical analyst for a long time. I have a degree in biology and love working in hospitals and in tech. I've been practicing SQL and Python on your analystbuilder website for awhile and applying for jobs here and there. Love your videos! I hope you make more niche specific videos for those of us who want to save the world one query at a time. 😊🎉
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Well , I was a Doctor and shifted to Data analysis , thought that I can merge that now after my time in Data Analysis ,
 but these systems we didn't use in Egypt :D so back to square one"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"New subscriber,beginner data analyst"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I applied so many positions in healthcare they always rejected me. Why ? I don't have experience in this field. And I'm looking for the answer ?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Drugs are bad. Mkay. XD
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"This is so cool..  If you want to become a healthcare analyst and don't have any experience like me,  we could form a learning group.."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Why do people lie about death threats so easily. And they never put the death threats as the 1st concern, its always somewhere down on the list....like an after thought."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"My very first job right out of college (comsci) is IT staff at a local hospital. I was the only IT in there and worked as the administrator of the Hospital Information System that the hospital was using where I grant medical staffs access to some features of the system, troubleshoot system errors, entered patient records including ICD codes and some procedures, and Microsoft SQL for technical issues with the database.

I regret not using that opportunity to learn more about data analytics as I was looking at a dev role that time. But now I am still in the healthcare industry still working with patient records, claims and even medicine codes, at a different healthcare facility but smaller, and I don't want to make the same mistake again of taking opportunity to learn as granted. Guess I can treat this as a good start for me :)"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I have been in finance but I really want to enter healthcare. I feel like I have what it takes.
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Awesome content! Thank you Alex
Ka2mDrKEAhg,In the U.S. ICD-10 is currently in use and was formerly ICD-9. ICD-11 is coming.
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Can't wait for the next video on the series 😊
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"What are the chances of getting hired by a US company if you live abroad? I've got a master's in applied statistics and I've worked with nurse researchers as a statistical consultant for example, and right now I'm senior data analyst for a British gambling company."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hey Alex, Great Video as always , Can you make video talk about avro orc and parquet, Thank you very much for your hard effort♥"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hello sir. I am  from Nigeria. I have two questions:

1. I would love to know if you offer internship programmes for Aspiring Data analyst from Nigeria. 

2. And also as a residence in Nigeria, can I get a remote job over in the States while living in Nigeria?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,This videos is very helpful especially for people who are newly going into data analysis
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Do you have another purchase code for the analyst builder?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Hii sir i want to become a data scientist my question is that data scientist has scope for future or not i am 20 year old started learning data scientist skills...
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Hii sir i want to become a data scientist my question is that data scientist has scope for future or not i am 20 year old started learning data scientist skills...
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Your company has to sponsor you in order to acquire an EPIC training certification. You cannot go ahead an do it on your own. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hey Alex, I appreciate your videos and I am learning too much. I would like you to consider creating more videos others types of analyst in other areas."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Many thanks, Alex, for the healthcare analytics series👏👏. Soooo glad that you will do a tutorial using data from an EHR system and ICD & CPT codes. I did some research and found a database called MIMIC-III that contains healthcare data. Hope this helps 🙏🙏."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Am a Medical doctor and looking forward to do the transition into Health Tech.. I don't know how to get started..though I did some volunteering as a data management but not deep at all and was in a small clinical practice. .. So I am a beginner in all of this. 
This video come at the right time.. Thank you so much."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Can a healthcare data analyst work from home ?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Great stuff Alex. Absolutely loveeee this one
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Thanks alex for this rich tips on healtcare analysing. I have put alot of energy on Pandas, and very poor on excel, so whats your advice , shall i go back and learn excel while i have good knowledge on FAMOUS PANDAS ?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I’m in healthcare IT as well . CMS.gov  is the site I use often for material and codes . Thanks Alex ❤ I need to view your site for a fresh up on my skills 😊
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Great stuff, Alex. Eager for the rest of the course."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Cool, I’m a healthcare data analyst without domain knowledge and technical background"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Thank you for your video. Coming from Health insurance industry this is something i am looking forward to
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Thank you very much Alex! To think that I planned to become a data analyst in the healthcare industry and didn't know how to go about it, this is so timely I honestly appreciate it. I have started some courses on Analyst builder and I must say that the platform is dope and thank you for making it free and accessible. Kindly expatiate the types of codes a Healthcare Analyst should know. And how can one get certified in EMRs and EHRs?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Can you please make videos on ETL pipelines, like how to build an ETL pipelines. It will be very helpful to us get a job, nowadays for an role of Data analyst it is must to have an knowledge on ETL pipelines and Data warehouse. Can you please consider my response😇🙂"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Are there even any jobs available for those without a degree anymore? The thing I keep hearing is the low end juniors are being replaced by AI?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hey Alex - is the domain knowledge more of a dealbreaker for particular domains more than others. I'm thinking Finance would definitely be one of those domains, given how narrow and restrictive some areas are with recruitment and hiring for non-tech related roles like Investment Banking Analyst/Associate. 

Is this something one can overcome? While I do have some domain knowledge, it's not as current as it should be. I can imagine some working proficiency with the Bloomberg terminal + the BMC (certi on fundamentals of the terminal), as well as formal training in global markets and products. I'm interested in seeing if it's possible to ultimately transition from one area of tech (cyber) to something like a Global Markets Analyst /  Macroeconomics analyst and tying in data analytics / trend analysis / sentiment analysis / etc. in support of decision makers whether that be Portfolio Managers or clients. 

I imagine SQL, Tableau, Excel for sure b/c Finance, Bloomberg/Factset/Refinitiv Eikon or similar would be helpful or must haves? Any experience you may have with strategizing something similar?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Epic certifications are only provided to those who work for a company that can sponsor you. My experience with getting hired if they ask for Epic experience is that if you don't have it, they skip you. It's basically the only requirement they care about. This is in the SanFranBayArea.."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hi Alex, 

Great content, I subbed right away. I have 15 years of experience in healthcare working in different capacities, from direct customer service (Front Desk) to C-suite expertise and everything in between. One of my degrees is in nursing; thus, I worked as a nurse for a number of years (I also have a master's degree in Management). I have been trying to get into the Healthcare Data Analytics/Business Intelligence field and recently completed the Google Data Analytics and Business intelligence professional certificates (Tablaeu on the way). 

Yet, I cannot even get an interview for a part-time position or an internship. Is there a trick to breaking into the field? Any help/suggestion would be appreciated."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"I would recommend learning, or at least being aware of, SAS and HL7/FHIR."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Alex my GOAT, thank you for providing this informative video on Healthcare Analyatics. I'm looking forward to the series to work on some Healthcare-related projects."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"I am a healthcare personnel and I love health care analysis. This pop up  is really exciting and I'm going to dip into it.
Thank you very much Sir.

Please, can I work as a healthcare analyst remotely?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Thank you for updating the series. I wish you would post everyday and you will find me there for sure ❤. Your Egyptian Pharmacist Tarek😁 . Keep it up Alex 💪 all love from Egypt
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Saw this pop up on my feed unknowing much about your background, but I've watched some of your videos in the past. I am an Epic EHR analyst who's trying to move to business intelligence, so this video was very helpful. Thank you!"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Hi Alex, I did my master of arts in Geography, Am I eligible for healthcare analyst?"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Please let's do R playlist also. Thanks Alex.
Ka2mDrKEAhg,This is awesome healthcare data analytics all the way
Ka2mDrKEAhg,Another great video! One tip is if you're not able to get your employer to provide you with Epic-sponsored training you might consider applying for research assistant roles at a hospital or lab to add clinical experience to your resume
Ka2mDrKEAhg,oooh i'm early for video 2 in this series 😼
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I currently work in healthcare as an IT support so I really appreciate your insight on healthcare analytics. Thank you Alex
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Wow!!

This is something I was just thinking about and telling a colleague of mine a few minutes ago and now this video pops up, as a medical laboratory scientist and a data analyst I am really excited for this."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,I'm watching this within 10 minutes of upload. No R Playlist available 😢. Please quickly
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"I'm a medical coder, so this material is right down my alley. I'm so excited for this series of videos. 😀"
Ka2mDrKEAhg,How are data analyst roles going to be affected by AI?
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"Sir, I would like it if you could take me as your student in Healthcare Analyst."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,"👍🏾 love the new direction, heading to higher levels."
Ka2mDrKEAhg,2nd

k8nBWL6K884,Thank you for this video i’ve been studying In healthcare analytics for a year but i was still a but loss but you definitely made it clearer
k8nBWL6K884,"Hi ! I am a graduate from Medicine and currently before licensing in US, starting to build a career in Health Informatics more specifically as a healthcare data analyst. 
What are the things I must do stepwise to be successful, I will do a Masters but I mean rarely Masters teaches the hands on tools. I have worked in IT- Automation and Governance hence I already have some background knowledge of IT. I would really appreciate if you suggest a guideline or courses and training from coursera or other open source that can help to be skilled technically to step into this industry. Thank you for your time."
k8nBWL6K884,"Many thanks for this playlist, Hugely helpful. Is there more in this series ?"
k8nBWL6K884,"Any courses or certificates you suggest which helps to  land healthcare analyst/ with mastering 
EHR/ EMR would be valuable in the long run. Thank you, Alex!"
k8nBWL6K884,"Thank you so much for talking about Data Analytics in healthcare. Please, if you can make a video on how to start a company or work on a start-up in Data Analytics in healthcare will be of great help to me.
I'm a Cameroonian and I need assistance 🙏"
k8nBWL6K884,"Alex, Thank you I found your video very helpful. I am nurse with 7 years of experience and  seriously considering moving away from bedside. You have mentioned SQL, Excel and learning at least one each of data visualization tools ( Tableau or Power BI) and at least one programming language ( Python or R) . On your website do you have all these courses available? 
Thank you"

Thank you"
k8nBWL6K884,"Many thanks, Alex, for talking about healthcare analytics 👏👏. Can you make a tutorial using data from an EHR system (not real data, of course) and give us an overview of what KPIs or questions a healthcare analyst is required to answer? So that people who haven't worked with EHR before get an idea about how the process goes."
k8nBWL6K884,"Hi Alex, I am  an HCC auditor in optum . I got certified in Power BI. I have learned SQL and advanced Excel. Do you think if I get certified as CAHIMS will help me to land a job in healthcare IT."

I've been following you and watching your videos on data analytics.

I need your guidance regarding that, and if I can I have a direct link to you for mentorship I'll appreciate it🙏"

k8nBWL6K884,I'm currently an IT support specialist at an orthopedic surgery clinic and will become a health analyst with help from your videos thanks Alex
k8nBWL6K884,"I am totaly lost and need your advice Alex, please! 
I'm an IT engineer, finished Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, but didn't find it very useful 
and now I'm wondering whether to take 
IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate	OR	IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
which one do you recommend? do It stick to the ""Analyst"" or follow the Data Science ?"
k8nBWL6K884,"Hello Alex,

Please can you do 🙏 series video on financial analyst"
k8nBWL6K884,"I fell into healthcare analytics by accident; I took a job collecting medical records on-site at various doctor offices, hospitals, and clearing houses; I wound up learning roughly 35 different EHR/EMR systems(Epic, Cerner, etc.) and once COVID hit I was able to continue working remotely. I was retrieving > 15 charts per hour and a supervisor saw my potential; I wound up in a pilot capacity program where eight of us would assist in forecasting how much volume we had vs. how many remote processors we would need along with building a credential database within Excel(and then weekly upkeeping to ensure the processor's credentials didn't lapse to prevent retrieval). This eventually led to an operational analyst role where I was responsible for >3 million medical records within 17 states for a healthcare client using SQL to download data and then updating databases in Excel. I was laid off back in late summer 2023, but then found another remote healthcare analyst role at a company whose clients are pharmaceutical companies."
k8nBWL6K884,"Thank you for posting this, because this is the field I want to transition into when I finally get all my certification and knowledge of analytics."
k8nBWL6K884,May God bless you 🎉❤
k8nBWL6K884,this is going to be a beautiful journey
k8nBWL6K884,Thank you Alex
k8nBWL6K884,"Thank you, Alex! 🙏"
k8nBWL6K884,"Thank you for this series! I work as a healthcare analyst for a government organization, I receive several questions from individuals looking to transition into this field who worked previously as dentists and pharmacy technicians."
k8nBWL6K884,Alex thank you for the insight. I have been in healthcare for ten years and just finished up the analysis builder road map. I think healthcare analysis is a great combination of both. Will you give some tips on data set to use for projects?
k8nBWL6K884,"Hi alex can you please provide a solution or make a video on the following issue
""The core problem stems from inconsistent and non-standard naming conventions between the columns in the source document and the database.  This is compounded by the fact that the columns are not in the same order.  Essentially, there's no reliable, direct way to match a column in the source document to its corresponding column in the database just by looking at the names.  This makes automated validation difficult.  The large number of columns and rows exacerbates the problem, making manual comparison only way but it is impractical."""
k8nBWL6K884,Will be waiting for the rest !!!
k8nBWL6K884,Oh yeah!!!!
k8nBWL6K884,"hi Alex I thanks for all  you do. I wanted to ask  if there is away  to practice data cleaning when my system doesn't have enough processor power to run the codes? are there any online platform where I can  run SQl , python codes without doing the major work on my system"
k8nBWL6K884,"Thank you for creating this series! This is an industry that I’m hoping to pivot to. I’m pursuing a health informatics certificate at my local state college alongside my CS degree (career changer). 

It just seems like an industry that’s hard to break into without healthcare industry experience, so I’m hoping the cert can help with some of the domain knowledge that I’m lacking. 

Applied to a local internship for Johnson & Johnson so hopefully I’ll get contacted for an initial interview 🤞🏾"
k8nBWL6K884,I look forward to this series. I'm currently in physical therapy and I've considered a switch into data but I discouraged everytime I try a tutorial and all the examples given are for like marketing products. That just doesn't interest me so I always quit and think that data must not be for me then. But I hope to get good insights from this series!
k8nBWL6K884,I wanted this so badly 😊❤
k8nBWL6K884,"REMINDER ALEX

5:25 Future video: Different type of data a data analyst work with (insurancce claims etc)"
k8nBWL6K884,"Hey Alex, I know you mentioned that you need some type of healthcare experience to break into healthcare analytics, however, how about someone looking to switch career tracks into healthcare data from another industry? I'm in a somewhat data analytics role, looking to make a change."
k8nBWL6K884,Omg finally!!
k8nBWL6K884,Which project would you recommend for a healthcare portfolio? Have you any examples av data ?
k8nBWL6K884,"Just in time, I saw the post on LinkedIn."
k8nBWL6K884,"Thank you so much for posting this video. I'm a medical coder, and I always wanted to get into healthcare analytics. This video came just in time."
k8nBWL6K884,"i wanna be a health analyst this year ,give me the jorney alex"
k8nBWL6K884,"I’ve had two internships working with healthcare data and it made me realize how little I know. There’s so many moving parts in healthcare that someone can make an entire career just focusing on one part: Population Health, Med Econ, etc. I’m actually in the process of deep diving into some benefits/cost analytics right now, and this video series came out at the right time to supplement ! Looking forward to this series Alex! And awesome beard 🤩

P.S: to anyone interested in healthcare analytics get ready for a WORLD  of acronyms. The acronyms NEVER END. the ACRONYMS have ACRONYMS."

1 = Agriculture 
2= Business 
3= Trader

1 is my data view to signify Agriculture right.

What type of formula would you suggest I use to bind 1 to agriculture on excel? 

Is the formula =TEXT() okay to bind it with or the formula =IF() okay to bind it with?"

hXpt8zj_ajc,Very helpful! I recently had to convert a string into a date and format it a certain way.

ItZlTixh6Bs,❤❤
ItZlTixh6Bs,"Thanks simple , good and quick explanation."
ItZlTixh6Bs,ALEX KEEP ON GIVING US THE BEST. THANKS MAN
ItZlTixh6Bs,"KPIs are good at saying ""Everything is fine"" or ""Something is wrong"". Often ratios or percentages. They are massaged, filtered, indirect knowledge of the actual situation. MBAs learn about them because they are not industry specific. Inventory/Annual Sales. They avoid getting your hands dirty knowing the actual specifics. Let's say a purchasing agent used cheaper plastic 2 years ago and now many customers are switching to the competition due to poor longevity. Which metric will specifically tell you the problem? ""Something is wrong"". The senior guy can yell at the junior guy to fix the Sales metric. And on down the line. More marketing money fixes sales problems! But no one will ever go back to the good plastic."
ItZlTixh6Bs,Maybe Im wrong - but is this playlist in logical from the beginning-up order? Should Cleaning be before collection ? I am not so sure - you folks see where Im coming from here?
ItZlTixh6Bs,"thank you so much for the clarification, its quite helpful"
ItZlTixh6Bs,👏
ItZlTixh6Bs,"Thank you Alex, this helps me understand what others are talking about at work."
ItZlTixh6Bs,Thank you
ItZlTixh6Bs,Thank you!
ItZlTixh6Bs,"Alex, can you please update us on the Power BI Course release date on your website. It's very well-needed,"
ItZlTixh6Bs,Thank you Alex short and insightful.
ItZlTixh6Bs,"Hey Alex, this is completely off topic but do you think DSA skills are required for a data analyst ? Also love your channel !!"
ItZlTixh6Bs,Great explanation Alex ! Truly impressive you were able to get this into a 5 min vid super clearly and succinctly
ItZlTixh6Bs,"Hey, Alex!! Thanks for another good video.

Just one thing: I don't know if it's a bug or an update delay but, for me, the title of the video is set as ""Temporary Title"".  If it is not like that for you, just disconsider it. But if it is, and if possible, it may be a good idea to update it so it can be easier to find, search.

Thanks again!"
ItZlTixh6Bs,Very helpful❤
ItZlTixh6Bs,Thank you Alex!
ItZlTixh6Bs,Thank you so much Alex for making things so clear.
ItZlTixh6Bs,"Wow,this is the same question I asked today in my linkedin,"
ItZlTixh6Bs,"funny how in my 4 year old company, we're still confused with what kpis and metrics are. we're suddenly curious about a metric then suddenly it becomes a team's kpi. it's really important to stress out that kpi's should be aligned with business goals. just having a ton of metrics meet an arbitrary number doesn't necessarily mean you're in the green"
ItZlTixh6Bs,"wow, im juz about to opened youtube to get to know about metrics and i got it in timeline before im searching for it."
ItZlTixh6Bs,The graphic that you used to explain the difference at 4:09 ....could you make into PDF?
ItZlTixh6Bs,Thank you Alex for a basic explanation!  I heard these terms before but never knew exactly the difference between them.  Now I do!
ItZlTixh6Bs,why you sound exactly like the khan academy guy hahaha

hCmEfxy-BXg,Ruderbhega
hCmEfxy-BXg,One of the most beautiful video on this channel and the best one about Alex The Analyst Show. I worked as Data Analyst in a big Bank in Italy and I agree everything.
hCmEfxy-BXg,3 months later after it was posted and listening to it feels even more current and accurate. Big tech changed a lot and all you said is showing in clear colors now. Ratabega.
hCmEfxy-BXg,rutabaga
hCmEfxy-BXg,"The audio is very low, then when the ad comes in its too loud. Hope it can be fixed in future uploads for this series. Thanks!"
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Rutebaga, thank you for doing this!"
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Rudabega, thanks. No monitor is insane actually. But 40"" monitor is even crazier."
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rudderbega. Alex keep up the good work
hCmEfxy-BXg,"As someone who thought of wanting to be into big techs, a few years ago, just months ago makes me asking myself, do I understand what I want? Especially from a perspective where ive no degree in particular, no knowledge whatsoever and also any knowledge, former or latter about tech industry, and its workplaces

This video makes me deepen my question (im not saying he influenced me, im just saying he is among those who made longer videos and thus expanded my thought process). 

And I believe, while upskilling myself, I should just pursue whatever opportunity (informed research), that allows me to practice those knowledge. Perhaps after 1 year, ill find my purpose. And if bigtech is still in my head, ill go for it. 

But as someone who also wanna matter, I do want to consider smaller companies. With less management and therefore, less fruitful politics. 

Thanks Alex, I wish I can afford your course, cause I earn only Malaysian RM hahahahaa

Sorry, I replied to early hahaha. RUTABAGA!!!!

Thanks again for making this video feel so real, funny thing on the screen size, and also happy travelling~"
hCmEfxy-BXg,"I listened to the end. I haven't found yet clarification why big tech is overrated in 2025 as of because they just had a big laying off ? The info that you've shared it is mostly about why you don't like to work for a company/ cooperates and why you prefer to work as a consultant. If you can share Why do a lot of people still rate those big techs in a top high ranking ? It shouldn't be only the good benefit that been offered from them. It should have more sides to talk about as well. 

I think you mean that people don't need to aim to work with big techs only. Small companies can be rating as same as big techs. My opinion and experience, Work environment and management politics in work places are same all over the world not only in big firms, same in small firms. Work with big firms you would get more chance to get bigger in career path while to work in small firms you will be stuck in short time and no benefit increased. As well as you have to encounter the same matters and politics in both. That is why big techs still be in a higher ranking that people value and want to work with."
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rudabega! Thanks so much as always for your essential insights!
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rudabega
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Rutabaga. Awesome point of view, Alex, on big tech nowadays!😅"
hCmEfxy-BXg,When I figured out I can have more impact inspiring rather than killing myself to produce an expensive prototype—I became a target 🙄🙄🙄
hCmEfxy-BXg,rutabaga 😂
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rude E-Bagel
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rudabega!!!
hCmEfxy-BXg,I feel the lack of growth in tech in most companies after they have things set up
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga. Thank you for the insights!
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Is Rutubaga even real?
Thanks for the chat. What are your plans for the year?"
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga🎉
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabega
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga. You need to say it like they say Cauliflower in Logan Lucky. 🤣
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Golden handcuffs?!?! Weren’t you only making $125k as an Analytics Manager? $125k ain’t golden handcuffs. That’s nothing in data. Calm down. Put the ego away. Also, Fortune 500 doesn’t mean anything either."
hCmEfxy-BXg,rutabega
hCmEfxy-BXg,"In my opinion, it's really great that you know and you do what you want to do. Good luck!
Rutabaga :)"
hCmEfxy-BXg,RU-do-be-ga. What i heard
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga 😁
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga- that was a great listen!
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutherberger
hCmEfxy-BXg,Thank you Alex!! very honest and insightful chat. The Vegetable is Rutabaga!!!!!!!!
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga :)
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rudubayga. Thanks for your Insights
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutherbega. Trust you enjoyed your journey with your family.
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Rutabaga. The problems you have mentioned are apparent once a company reaches a certain size. 

Work is a means to an end and does not define a person. Which means that if you are on a team that’s in maintenance mode, but you want to work on cutting edge stuff. This does not mean that someone is worth more than you. It could be the luck of the draw. Do what you gotta do to meet your goals.

Things may be different now, but one additional benefit to working in big tech was the opportunity to meet amazing passionate people who were shaping the tech landscape. You can meet these people outside of big tech, but it’s unlikely."

hCmEfxy-BXg,"Rutabega, thank you for the insight, it really opened up my mind"
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Good video, it would be helpful if you also listed some alternatives if one does not wish to go with big tech. As a data analyst what would be the ideal middle ground between a place where you can make lots of money, but are having a terrible time and a place where you don't feel miserable everyday, but it doesn't pay well?
Also, your videos on Python tutorials for beginners have been very helpful currently learning pandas for a project I'm working on and I have to say you have a real talent for teaching. I created an analyst builder account when you were first getting started, but I don't think I ever enrolled in any courses. That may change soon."
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Well, if we are talking about root vegetables? The spelling would be ""Rutabaga."" How was your trip in Pennsylvania?"
hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga
hCmEfxy-BXg,Thank you for this honest chat🙏🏽
hCmEfxy-BXg,If anyone here is considering buying Alex's Analyst Builder course just know that it's top quality and worth the cost. I've tried many of different coding course over the years and I can confidently say that Alex's teaching style and the course are top tier.  #Rutabaga

hCmEfxy-BXg,Rutabaga. This was a great video. I want college aged people to see this. They are experiencing a lot of disillusionment. I want them to aspire to things outside of big tech.
hCmEfxy-BXg,"if you’re wondering how i watched it so fast, x2. first of all, rudabada or whatever and secondly, good luck on the 12 hour drive. 

now to the topic, it depends on the stage you are in your career. the reason why i liked your channel was because there was sort of a hand holding (back then) when people wanted to join analytics and it felt like, hey, we’ve got a friend to learn with. 

There are still people at that stage, they don’t know if they want to make impact or add value, they just need a, wait for it, a job. Like let me just work, i’ll worry about a lay off later. Everything you said is miserable but a lot of people going into analysis role, want to work and grow. After applying to thousands of jobs, I decided to freelance on Upwork and I remember a video you said people can try that and I was like “erm it’s not that easy”. I wouldn’t advice anyone to join Upwork or any freelancing site but people just want to move the needle in their careers. 

Not everyone is even going to end up at big tech. infact less than 1% (statistically) will but imagine being paid to do ETL, i would do that even if I get laid off. Even if it brings no value, lol and if one day, I’m financially free enough to say “is big tech worth it?” then I will hold another person’s hand, with a kleenex in between 😂, and say do it first, the decide. 

all the best with your new monitor 😅and have a nice holiday ❤"
hCmEfxy-BXg,"Not only overrated, but it is a scam business…."

TtCBz1lutsY,Thanks love it
TtCBz1lutsY,"Thanks so much for your video and the updated answers to these questions! I am a disabled veteran currently working on the Google Data Analytics cert, and also doing your free Data Analyst bootcamp. I am leaving a comment on each vid from the 2023 ones as bookmarks 😅. I am almost halfway through the Google certification after a week, when I am done I am going to focus full-time on your bootcamp instead of the split, then your website and will begin applying as soon as I get the main three skills down and projects. Hopefully my Bachelors degrees will help, in addition to the networking I am starting to build now."
TtCBz1lutsY,Wonderful answers

TtCBz1lutsY,"I completed the basic MySQL on data analyst bootcamp taught by you🎉and I'm excited for next chapters,thank you for bootcamp 😊"
TtCBz1lutsY,"I wanna offer a point of discussion and so here's the question. How about the importance of having a good/great personal brand?? My humble opinion is that this is getting much more important by the day and it could be one of the main features for getting clients or even the job at the company that you want. Basically, using your personal brand as a sort of resumé.
Love your channel Alex and also the Analyst Builder which is great to say the least 😍"
TtCBz1lutsY,Thanks for sharing Alex

I graduated with a degree in Medical Imaging, a field within the healthcare sector, and then I entered into the world of data, developing my skills as a data analyst, where I discovered my true passion.

Now, I aspire to find a job that bridges both fields, such as a Healthcare Data Analyst role. I firmly believe that discovering your channel was no coincidence but rather a great source of inspiration that has motivated me to pursue this path.

Thank you so much, Alex, for this incredible motivation and please continue sharing your valuable content!"

Ihmq-qeA5Pc,I have only discovered your channel this morning and I’ve already started the path of shifting from Recreational Therapy/ Life Coach into Data Analytics. I’ve taken a short course and have fallen in love with data visualization. I’ve always enjoyed collecting data and building systems but never knew how to do it or where to go for it to be done. Thank you for doing what you do and sharing your journey with us who have shifted or looking for a sign to switch careers!

I started my Masters program in Public Health and decided to  take the Google data analytics course. Since, I have finished both and will be trying to dive more into data analytics so I can become a Public Health Consultant. I will be watching all your courses to brush up and I will be checking out your new program. Thank you for telling your story, I hope I am as successful in 7 more years!!"

Ihmq-qeA5Pc,"Jalepeño 🫑🫑🫑 Loved your journey. I started my data journey after watching one of your videos back in 2021. But the thought that I had to put in more effort to transform into a techie from a non techie person gave me jitters and eventually I gave in to the thought. I did however not stop myself from keeping myself updated with what was going on in the field of Data. 

Recently, when I decided to give my data journey another chance, it was your videos again that popped in front of me. Hope I don't ditch it this time. 

Merry Christmas to you and your family. 

See you around."

Ihmq-qeA5Pc,"Hello Alex, thank you for your video. That’s a very inspiring story. I actually work in an inpatient hospital in the discharge team and like you I also have patience who were facing similar problems as the job that you had before in the hospital. I’m happy to say that today an opportunity came within my team. A person that I know higher up is doing a data analysis, impatient discharge and they are using tableau. I reach out to him and said that I have experience with Excel Seco and Tablo and data analysis and offered to help he was very happy with this and has invited me for their meetings. I think this will be a great opportunity for me to learn more and transition from my current role into data in the future. Thank you so much for everything. I really appreciate all the effort you have put into everything because we can now all benefit from it."
Ihmq-qeA5Pc,jalapeno… Great history and thanks for inspiring and bringing your bits of advice and knowledge to more people. Really Appreciate it. Good luck with your minivan trip 😂and enjoy your Christmas.

wQQR60KtnFY,"I love this, I'm looking forward to finishing this. I would have loved a certification from this video when I am done Mr Alex"
wQQR60KtnFY,My time 23:23
wQQR60KtnFY,I find it difficult to instal My SQL...Isn’t there other option rather than my SQL?
oHte3qFa-oY,"Hi Alex, I am trying to sign up but it's throwing up an error. something about the billing method, I am using my Nigeria ATM... please anyone has a solution to this?"
oHte3qFa-oY,"Hi Alex,

I followed your YouTube tutorial on Amazon QuickSight because I simply wanted to explore the service for learning purposes. Unfortunately, the video did not mention that once the Free Tier limit is exceeded, AWS immediately bills the full monthly amount for QuickSight. I enabled the service exactly as shown and have now been charged more than USD 600 in just a few days.

As a student with a very limited budget and no commercial projects, this unexpected expense is horrible. I had assumed I would remain within a free-tier or low-cost environment while experimenting."
oHte3qFa-oY,"Hi Alex, I have a quick question that I discovered aws is not supporting newly created s3 bucket to use 'select' to retrieve data anymore, so I'm not able to run query on s3 bucket around 20:14 on your video. Would you be able to show us how to do that? Thank you"
oHte3qFa-oY,Dude - thanks for making this easy and approachable. 🙏
oHte3qFa-oY,"Great video, thanks Alex."
oHte3qFa-oY,Thank you so much Alex. truthfully speaking this was my first lesson about AWS and it being about data analytics i have really enjoyed it. you presentation is just on top
oHte3qFa-oY,Great communicator and super helpful intro. Probably needs to pre-run some of the functions more before recording as several instances didn't work out as planned.
oHte3qFa-oY,Like boot camp + certificate can u create a video sir ?
oHte3qFa-oY,God bless you
oHte3qFa-oY,19 mins in you said it takes a couple hours to restore are we suppose to wait that long because then you clicked on Q3 and that option doesn’t even pop up
oHte3qFa-oY,"Hey Alex, it would really be great if you created an AWS-based data analytics project just to guide beginners on gaining hands on try at AWS for data analytics. Cos there’s nothing like that on YouTube."
oHte3qFa-oY,Thank you
oHte3qFa-oY,Sir please make a video on aws project for data analyst specially
oHte3qFa-oY,"this video is so helpful in understanding these complex tools involved in this workflow! thanks, Alex!"
oHte3qFa-oY,"Amazing explanation. Your presentation is genuine and  lasts longer in term of skills and informations .Your  Pedagogical approach is smooth , concise, and straightforward . 
Eager to discover more videos on AWS services. 
Un grand merci pour vos efforts louables."
oHte3qFa-oY,"You made me into AWS, Alex 😃❤"
oHte3qFa-oY,"I have just joined as an Intern Data Scientist for a couple of weeks, and the first big project I am a part of requires me to understand these exact AWS services (specially Quicksight). I can't exaggerate how much this video will help me. I've also been watching your free data analyst bootcamp playlist. Thank you so much for putting content like this up for free!"
oHte3qFa-oY,really liked ur all videos superb keep going love from india
oHte3qFa-oY,When will u explore SAS or kind to make a video about SAS or python which one  is market demand

oHte3qFa-oY,World is better place just because people like you are in this world. I really appreciate your efforts. You give a positive vibe. I like how you present yourself and that smile of yours ❤️ love from India...
oHte3qFa-oY,"Finally, my comment is one of the first ones. First of all, Alex thaaaank you, love your channel. These videos are extremely informative and easy to comprehend. Quick question, how to upload huge tables into MySQL without having to wait hours?
Thank you again, good luck, keep it coming !!!
P. S. Your auditory is very diverse (i know Turks, Russians watching your videos). I'm from Azerbaijan currently reside in US."
oHte3qFa-oY,"Hi Alex. I have been watching and learning data analysis for a long time.
Could you please make a video of Data Modeling. Like real time projects like how you create video of anything in depth.
I'll be looking forward to watching your video on data modeling.
Thank you."
P7p2OZj9ewU,"For those watching after June 2025 the sql will fail at 38:59 when you try to create the user for ADF In that case Do the Following:
1. In All All service find AAD or 'Azure Active directory' 
2. Then Click ""Add' select 'User from the dropdown, then select 'Create New User'
3. in the Create New user Form in the Form field User principal name type the desired user name and mention Display name as  Azure Data Factory DB or any thing that you wish, then also copy the auto generated Password and save it in Notepad
4. Then Review and create the user , you will be sent back to the starting page where you saw the Add button 
5. Below the searchbar  there is a hyperlink with text 'user' click on that it will show all the AD users 
6. Find and click to open the user that you just created. and then copy the 'User principal name' using the copy button given
7. Then come back the Data Store where you are running the SQL query and replace the username as shown in the video with the text copied in the ealier step the sql query should look something like this 

*CREATE USER [userName@YourAzureAccountEmail.onmicrosoft.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;* 

That should work !!! Unless Azure team at MS make changes to it"
P7p2OZj9ewU,Does this video cover all information about azure in data analytics ?

P7p2OZj9ewU,I need a 10 hour Azure lesson with a certificate in the end!!! a lot of employers are looking for azure together with the other data analyst skills as well.
P7p2OZj9ewU,I literally wanted to ace this but recently I learnt free aws free tier  account cost a fortune so I will back down
P7p2OZj9ewU,"I just finished going through your Power BI Tutorial and was filling out my resume using one of your templates. The only thing that I was missing was an Azure tutorial, which is a lot harder to find than I thought. This morning I woke up to this video on my feed. Thanks again for coming to my rescue!"
P7p2OZj9ewU,"Alex, the Guru Analyst🙌. Your teaching style is fantastic as usual. I enjoyed watching, Boss."
P7p2OZj9ewU,Mentor don drop another one 🙌🙌🙌
P7p2OZj9ewU,"Thank you so much, Alex for this"
P7p2OZj9ewU,Another good one Alex!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hi Alex. Your calculations in the sumX section are WRONG ! pls check.

Your total profit is coming to 434.7k which is basically the multiplication of total sales by total net profit instead of the total of individual profits of each product. Hence, the individual breakdown of profits is also wrong. 

The correct profit is 43.2k. 

Do a quick calculation in excel to see the problem."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,25:21  I don't see a Model Tutorial csv file.. it's really distracting that the naming on your GitHub does not match your video..
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thx mann
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"first day 12:00
second day 51:50
third day 1:22:42
fourth day - finished

Thank you for this tutorial 😁"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Taking a look at the project , doing pre-processing in python pandas is much more convenient although the visualization tools are much much superior over here ❤❤"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,While explaining groups how did you select the 2 things individually at the same 53:07
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thanks alot Alex that's very well explained 😅
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thank you so much! That was very helpful for beginners.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,great
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Where to download the data sets
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"I must admit that you are a rock. Thanks a ton. It is convenient, super easy, and practical. I will do one after another and hope it will give me extra mileage."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hi, just want to  bring to your notice that in the DAX tutorial, your results for total profit or profit by customer aren't correct.

The total profit from all sales of all products actually turn out to be 43212.43. I think using RELATED keyword and creating a measure 'Profit' in Apocolypse  Sales table will solve this problem:

Profit = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales', (RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) * 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold]).

Then in the Report view, we can create a table with Customer and Profit columns."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,I got lost the moment you introduced excel worksheets with other pages which are not in the original worksheet you started with.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thank you Alex for this. This is great launchpad to start. Very valuable
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Easy to follow
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"I was part of a data analytics bootcamp — it was amazing, but I wanted to dive deeper into Power BI. Even though this power bi video is pretty basic, I learned a lot. It gets straight to the point and I believe that Alex is a wonderful teacher - everything was easy to follow. Thank you very much for sharing! Greetings from Colombia."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thanks alot Sir for this amazing video.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,You are a beast man <3
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Your channel is a life saver man
I0vQ_VLZTWg,I am unable to download the dataset
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Thank you for this video. but Please i dont know where to get the Apocolypse sales, store, customer information datasets or how do i find them?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Is anyone else having challenges downloading the dataset?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"how to get the pivot table data which you showed directly, please share that excel as well. unbale to go further in this project"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"where can we get the pivot table data for visualization, pls help"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Wow because of this, I know how to use power BI. While watching this I also do it in my laptop. Thank you."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,1:13:00 bro casually reminded me to stay hydrated!! <3 short comments like these r the ones making this course much interactive.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,i can tell in only 4 minutes how good u are as a teacher <33
I0vQ_VLZTWg,How do I get this old excel file in which pivot is made ?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,This video is unwatchable due to ads every 2 minutes. That's not an exaggeration.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"First time to learning power bi and I really enjoyed this video and  gave me the confidence. Thank you so much and for effort and lots of people to learn and help us for your video. I really enjoyed, Keep continue for support. once again thanks a lot......"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Very Excellent Tutorial, helped me a lot ! Thanks Alex !"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Thank you Alex. I am pivoting out of Engineering and into data analytics with an MBA. My first gig is in sales and requires data visualization in Power BI. This series and project has been immensely helpful
At or around 2:04:02 you mentioned going into a deeper two hour guided project using this same data set. Did that ever come out? I cant find it. Love to jump into that. Many thanks"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,This is a great Crash tutorial for beginners!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Make this project
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Amazing, thank you so much for sharing such great content. I am truly grateful to you!!!!"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thank you Alex!✨
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thank you. That helped a lot!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,thanks. it was easy and useful.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"This is helpful but I'd love for your mouse to be highlighted, you say which file in your dataset that you are using. Also, the each section starts and ends randomly. I realize its a collection of other videos but I have to guess at what you are doing sometimes."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,23:31 how those errors removed from attribute column when clicked on close & apply button?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hey Alex, currently looking for a data analyst job in the uk, your video was super helpful, I followed along and did the project, can I add it on my cv under my projects section?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Hello Alex! i followed you in your Exploratory Data Analysis in Pandas and it was helpful. Now i want to download the Power BI tutorial but it is hard for me to do that. Thanks
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hi Alex, how can i download the power BI desktop to a mac?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"thanks so much for this video, very informative"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"so weird that there are two labels for insert, if on home, also two tabs for transform in query. windows apps are a mess"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hi Alex Can you please upload the update file with the pivot table, the git hub folder doesn't contain that version  of the file thanks"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,One of the best video that ever watched on Power BI. Thanks Alex!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thanks a Lot Alex! Really Helpful.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"40:26 ""we're going to say ""Apocolypse Sales"", cuz that's the table we're looking at right now"" -> But we are looking at Apocolypse STORE, not 'Apocolypse sales'! Am I seeing things?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Why should be the default in the y-axis, SUM, COUNT, or what?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Hi Alex. Which excel dataset do we download. its not clear in the listing in the description
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Great tutorial! 🙌
If anyone’s looking for more Power BI tips, I just posted a new beginner-friendly tutorial here 👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juea2mjMazQ
Would love your feedback!"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,shouldn't milk be fine if it's long-life milk....?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Please, how can i get the setup to install it on my laptop?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"I can 't find the dataset Apocolypse Food Prep with pivot table, purchase overview and purchase tracker."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Power BI is great as long as you have a VERY basic and simple dataset to begin from.  PASS.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Great video on introducing power bi!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,This was very helpful. Added excel experience makes it even easier to follow and understand.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Thanks very much Alex! Your presentation was truly helpful! I was able to understand all the steps clearly, and it was really easy to follow along. You explained everything in such a simple and structured way—it made a big difference. Thank you!"""
I0vQ_VLZTWg,First time learning power bi and I enjoyed this video gave me the confidence I needed thank you for this piece of work I enjoyed it
I0vQ_VLZTWg,1:35 No. It has never opened on this screen for me.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,how can i download powerbi in mac air
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hello Alex, at 1:37:27 how did you able to load all the data. I can see 3 more steps were added automatically on the applied steps section. Please let me know how you did that, as a beginner I struggle with steps like that. Can anyone please help"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hi all, I'm just a self-learner and I'd like to dig deep beyond the logic of the measure that took place at: 29:40
Can someone do me a favor and explains to me why measure = COUNT(ProductID) worked uniquely? and not for sum of the products paid from customers residing in a specific state?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,why did he chose apocolypse sales in sumx in dax part instead of apocolypse store even though he was adding it to apocolypse store table ( Q- how to determine which table to choose)
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"After watching this my understanding is basically if u are good at excel, pivot tables and power query than you can use power BI as well"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Thank you for the good work, Alex."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,where is the excel
I0vQ_VLZTWg,is this course for absolute beginners?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,I cannot find the model tutorial :(
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Done 3 hours of learning!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Make a long video with more Data cleaning and Visualization process with this Data Alex🙏🙏🙏
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hye Alex i have a question. 
Rather than getting rid of others data. Cannot we split the column into 2 column by after the delimiter ':"" then replace everthing before delimiter"":"" to Space then merge both columns in that way we dont have to delete others data and its just 3 steps simple fast to clean that column.  Thank you so much for the tutorials."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hello Mr Alex.
I have a query. 
Mr Alex ,now I have mastered excel ,then I want to jump to another tool for learning. 
1. Sql 
2. Tablue or Powe Bi
What is your opinion 
Should I learn excel then sql ,power Bi
Or 
Excel, powe Bi ,sql
Which  road map is the best?
Thank you"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Great PowerBI tutorials. Thanks, Alex."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Profit column SumX is wrong
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thanks a lot Alex for providing this valuable knowledge. What an impressive and clear explanation of Power BI.
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"It could be a new feature of Power BI, but you can get Data Bars option even with don't summarize option. 1:07:38"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,46:58
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Can you update the excel datasets on your github? It is impossible to follow all of your steps with those one
I0vQ_VLZTWg,I can't get the applied steps to show up. Could you explain?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,thank you alex
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Great Video Alex, really helped as a great introduction into Data Visualization.

 Cheers!"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"23:28 you show us why putting the date results in an 'Error' but you don't show us how to revert the change. I tried to select the column and convert it back to ""text"" but I'm stuck with the 'Error' for all the rows on that column"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,thanks for such a great  content
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Hey Alex,
Hope you are doing well, while the project i got an error with date column it says DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Date value
Details:
    6/13/2022 
please let me know how to fix it. 
Thank you."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thanks Alex you're great Instructure
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Very educative
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"hello @alex the analyst, at 1:37:27, how did u jump from ""replaced value2"" to 4 more added steps??? kindly explain that because i'm lost there. These are the challenges we have with online teaching videos, insufficient explanation. I'd appreciate your prompt response as my last comment was never acknowledged. Thank you."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,plz let me know power BI vacancies with remote
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thank you sir
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Grateful Alex!
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"i am lil confused. why power BI. everything done here can be done in ms excel. can we get a video that shows a list of things that power BI can do better than Excel? or like things that we can do in power BI that we cant in excel? 
thank you"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"I don't think I did my installation right. It didn't take me to the SQL workbench, I don't even know how to get there.

I'm left with just the Command line Unicode. What do I do?"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Thank you Alex
I0vQ_VLZTWg,Can i earn a certificate from this course?
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"hello and thanks for the video. But i'm trying hard to understand your teaching method. for someone who has very little knowledge of power bi and data analysis, i don't understand some parts of your video. Take for example, @ 32:01, you had 3 data sets inside that model, ""customer information"" was the third and now you went over to the table view and i can't see customer information anymore, where did it go to?  what did u do with it? help us 
understand what you're doing. I feel like if you're moving on to another data set you should let us know because it is confusing, thank you very much"
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"I am very thankful for this video, in two days I am able to use Power Bi tool as well. I was not new in Data Analytics, but in Power BI. I consider it is very important to be able to use different tools in BI relating to the needs."
I0vQ_VLZTWg,you are awesome....a pro. found your video super useful for preparing for interview
I0vQ_VLZTWg,"Thank you Alex. Actually I spend four months studying Google Data analytics, which was west of time and money and ended with confusion. Your video was very handy, practical and easy to learn. God bless you."
tnz72ywhCoo,👍 thank
tnz72ywhCoo,"I previously wrote, “You  all have made such a great product, so unique!  Will you be making teaching videos for R, in addition to the Questions? I sure do hope so!”
So sorry I asked this, I heard the answer at 7:33 the second time I watched this video.  Thank you so much, looking forward to the R class!  Your latest videos are great too, especially for a newbie."
tnz72ywhCoo,"Hello, Alex

Thanks for your videos.

Your video on how to create a free website portfolio was my first. It was easy and really helpful.


Would you please make a video on how to clear an error 404 in github pages.

It says ""page not found""😢"
tnz72ywhCoo,Looking forward to all of the new additions!
tnz72ywhCoo,Thanks for all the hard work you put into this. Went back to school and what I've learned through your videos and through AnalystBuilder has helped me a lot. Breezed through some classes.
tnz72ywhCoo,Thank you for this Alex.
tnz72ywhCoo,Why are so many Data Analysts making a living as YouTubers? Isn't this perhaps a sign that there's not much demand for Data Analysts anymore?
tnz72ywhCoo,I just started doing your Data analyst boot camp 😭
tnz72ywhCoo,😘😘😘
tnz72ywhCoo,You have been busy!!
tnz72ywhCoo,😍😍
tnz72ywhCoo,Thank you for introducing the course.

j8FSP8XuFyk,"I finished the video. Thank you so much. I didnt follow the Caption for the table though, the caption occupied the whole table. 😅"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Thanks Alex, this video was helpful"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Very helpful.  I didn't realize the public version is an option.  I also learned about kaggle today.  Thank you for this.
j8FSP8XuFyk,"31:33 - You heard it first here, folks. ""DON'T TREAT PIE CHARTS AS A HIDEOUS STEPCHILD."""
j8FSP8XuFyk,someone please tell me exactly what they would write when putting this project on their resume
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thanks! This video is extremely helpful!~
j8FSP8XuFyk,"From the starbucks data set i cant get any location on the maps ,what could be the issue"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"New tableau has 10 Million Rows of data limit for free,they are making it worse for new users to learn something"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Hi Alex, learned a lot of small details! Just starting out , after learning Looker Studio. Are these dashboards are responsive ( from larger screens to table/mobile phone ) ?"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"This helped massively, cheers Alex. Looking for a job as a fresher this really made visualization easier."
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Your comment on Pie Charts is interesting.  Pie Charts generally don't get the point across when you have more than 5 to 6 slices. Any chart should tell a story clearly regardless if its a bar, a pie, line or scatter chart."
j8FSP8XuFyk,Where does the demographic dataset come from tho😂
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Thank you Alex, this is great stuff! I was sceptical about Tableau but your tutorials really helped break it down."
j8FSP8XuFyk,Great video ... a little slow paced but GREAT content
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you!
j8FSP8XuFyk,Not sure what happened at 33:40 . It didn’t have a transition.
j8FSP8XuFyk,I am having problem with the maps in the final project . The first time I'm dragging zipcode in Sheet 2 and choosing the maps visualization option the color isn’t showing. It's just a grey world map overall. Tried zooming in but it's not showing any color. Please help. How can i fix this ?
j8FSP8XuFyk,"I've gotten PowerBI down pretty well, but Tableau is a data visualization program that i've continually struggled with in regards to making professional looking dashboards. Going to be watching this video and taking a lot of notes!"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Helpful video
j8FSP8XuFyk,"is it okay to put the final project of this video, also the powebi project and excel final project in our portfolio ????"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"New to Tableau but not data analytics and visuals, and I think you did a great job with this video. It was easy to follow and you explained things well. One minor note though- I would keep the zero bedroom listings in your  analysis at the end because it likely represents studio units. That is just a minor quibble though.  Thank you what you video."
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Hi
I have a KPI dashboard on Tableau Cloud that has a filter for hundreds of employees.
Is there any way to export this report for each employee as PDF files? Thanks"
j8FSP8XuFyk,great video man helped a lot.
j8FSP8XuFyk,tableau no longer give free versions. you only get a 14 day trial
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Nice tutorial! Just one point I think should be better explained: the joins.

It's always recommended to use relationships because they allow to have more flexibility and you get the data correctly almost in all cases. 
Joins are deterministic for the full project, and don't allow personalization within visualizations. ""Data with Baraa"" has a video explaining this perfectly: ""Tableau Joins vs Relationships"".

In your example, in the last visualization where you count the number of Bedrooms available, you get a wrong count due to the Inner joined you used previously. Just because a bedroom listing doesn't have dates available in the calendar table, doesn't mean it's not listed (this always depends on what you interpret of course).
It just hit me because I used a left join, because I interpreted that listings don't need to have calendar entries in order to exist, and so I got higher numbers in the bedroom count."
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thanks Alex! I learned a lot!
j8FSP8XuFyk,What a legend
j8FSP8XuFyk,6:58
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Thank you for giving a basic overview of various functionalities of Tableau in an easy and effective manner. However, my maps are not showing color or labels (for example, prize per zipcode)."
j8FSP8XuFyk,It's so over
j8FSP8XuFyk,I tried working this out from canada... the map dint work out for me... any way to change the Geo?
j8FSP8XuFyk,56:43
j8FSP8XuFyk,"While this is very helpful learning Tableau, you really need to use Google Maps to look at the street view of zip code 98134. It's a downtown Seattle industrial area. I've been there. While it's very interesting to drive around, It's not a good place to live unless you like watching shipping and railroad activity. :)"
j8FSP8XuFyk,what df btw the video vs the analystbuilder course (if do not need a certificate)
j8FSP8XuFyk,"I’m just starting out on the data analyst world. Question, will this videos (tableau) help me prepare for the tableau certification?"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"in the starbucks dataset, why is it only showing postcodes for the US only. I'm from india and it shows me postcodes for India alone. Why so?"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"thank you much, appreciated"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you so much for the video!
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Nice video, but you should review relationships and joins as the explanation was not correct. 

Relationships are not ""almost the same as joins, just not as customizable"". They are the way of telling Tableau how tables should be joined in case the visualization requires the join to happen. The benefit is that the join is not done before the Viz, so that the source data can be maintained without possibly filtering out records due to a join.

Also, Tableau recommends not doing joins unless absolutely necessary."
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you for putting all your Tableau tutorials together! Would it be possible to see you walk through a new mini project with the updated data or on a different topic? It would be greatly appreciated
j8FSP8XuFyk,Great video
j8FSP8XuFyk,26.22. Dragging postcode doesnt seem to work. No bubbles appear on the map
j8FSP8XuFyk,"This is just next level Alex! Being a little greedy, it'd be great if we could get some timestamps :)"
j8FSP8XuFyk,doesn't show data on the map for me. are you supposed to be located in the US to view it?
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you.  The best on YouTube
j8FSP8XuFyk,Great Video. Thanks
j8FSP8XuFyk,This is great. Simplified the entire process. Thank you
j8FSP8XuFyk,SUPER helpful video. I am learning Tableau and this video saved my time a lot. Thank you for your work Alex.
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Ryan was a temp, seems about right leaving him out"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Thank you for the great video! Have you heard of the Analytics Model? It’s an AI-driven analytics platform that empowers everyone to generate personalized insights, enabling informed decision-making and actionable outcomes."
j8FSP8XuFyk,Your video halped me to believe in myself and finally start learning tableau.Loved detailed narration and positive attitude.Thank you Alex!
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Hello Alex, thank you for this amazing video"
j8FSP8XuFyk,"You are doing very well.
I am confident in handling a project with tabaule.
Thanks"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Hi alex  can U make a vedio on how to install Microsoft SQL in macbook m1
j8FSP8XuFyk,"I want to learn data analyst, do you recommend your site or should I settle for bootcamp data analyst on the channel?
Thank you for this excellent content"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Please make audio track system😢
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Hello, Alex, can you tag me on your video on testing hypothesis using crosstabs? Thank you"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Do you have paid online training?
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Nice video! Really appreciate the style and approach you’ve taken here. Just one note: at 35:00, it’s worth mentioning that relationships in Tableau are often significantly more performant and flexible than traditional joins. Relationships allow you to answer questions that would be difficult, if not impossible, to address with joins alone. For example, with a join, you might struggle to identify which job titles aren’t represented in your demographics or pinpoint demographics without corresponding job titles. Joins interface is very much goign to be the legacy approach vs the modern approach especially to get things working with semantic models and tableau pulse and other published data sources. 

Using relationships can also reduce the number of connections needed, streamlining your data model. Kirk Munroe has an excellent, in-depth video (https://youtu.be/Y2YgRYUMGYs?si=YEDIR4sXYl4s9qvG) on the benefits of relationships, and it’s a common misconception that Tableau lacks this capability, especially in comparisons to Power BI."
j8FSP8XuFyk,"@Alex, I love me some Tableau"
j8FSP8XuFyk,Snowflake please
j8FSP8XuFyk,"I was just searching for it in the afternoon, and now i got it 😁👍👍"
j8FSP8XuFyk,What version of the tableau do you use Alex?
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thank you very much Sir.
j8FSP8XuFyk,Great❤thank you❤🎉
j8FSP8XuFyk,Thanks 🎉😊
j8FSP8XuFyk,"Thank you soo much for these contents ❣️

If you don’t mind could you tell me a way to contact you directly via email or something else? Though I've tried to connect with you through emails and waited for your answer for a long time but still didn’t get your response :')"
j8FSP8XuFyk,It very excited.  Thanks Mr Alex.

zXnQNytHCPM,"I'm going through this currently just to brush up on my Excel skills.  Fun fact, at the around 2:18 mark, when you are talking about the order of the commuting (where the 10+ miles causes issues), I went off on a tangent and discovered you can create a custom sort order.  Go to File > Options > Advanced > Edit Custom Lists (under General).  There are some stored like the months and days of the week, but this allows you to add more!"

zXnQNytHCPM,"I can't access the datasets files for download purposes , kindly help with this"
zXnQNytHCPM,"Very helpful, thank you!"
zXnQNytHCPM,"Hi Alex. Do you ever use Excel for statistical calculations (eg, descriptive statistics, regression analysis etc) or would you use something like Python, R, Stata or SAS for that?"
zXnQNytHCPM,I'm a data analyst as well and of the rules I use the duplicate several times per day when I clean the data.
zXnQNytHCPM,"@2:13:57 It says ""There are no recommended charts for the data you selected"". I cannot find a fix and am now stuck at this part of the project. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

zXnQNytHCPM,I am not able to find the dataset used by you for making the pivot table. Can someone please help me find the dataset.
zXnQNytHCPM,Thank you for this.
zXnQNytHCPM,"Hi Alex, Thanks for this video; it is a great one. I have a question as regards the full project, and I will be grateful if you reply.
At the point where you tried to use the age groups along with the age bracket you created and it messed up the visualization, My question is, how will  another person know from the visualization that adolescence is this certain age range, old is this certain age range and so forth because another analyst can use a different age range with the same name you used for the age bracket?"
zXnQNytHCPM,"hey, i can't able to use xlookup in excel can you plz help me to solve this"

zXnQNytHCPM,Great Content!
zXnQNytHCPM,How did you learn this stuff?
zXnQNytHCPM,"The whole boot-camp workshop which was uploaded in the Freecodecamp channel starts with the SQL videos series which were your very old and beginning ones. So sir which will be better for us to take? The new SQL series which were newly uploaded by you with new interface and installation techniques? Or both are same and gonna be beneficial? Please give some advice, because I want to cover only one series among the both which will be enough for me and cover most of the parts.

Please try to respond brother :')"
zXnQNytHCPM,How do you I'm gonna search for it next 😁😁
zXnQNytHCPM,"Hi,  Alex.
 I'm a 21-year-old Economics graduate and I discovered your channel last month. Since then, I've been following your content and have gained so much valuable knowledge. Can you please tell me in short how much to master before I land my 1st internship or 1st job as a data analyst in the next 6 months as I heard that you only need to be great at 2 things from Excel, Python, SQL  and Power BI or Tableau. Is this true? and if it is then can you suggest which two skills i should master keeping the rest fundamentally strong.
I'm also completing your data analyst bootcamp.😊"

Day 2-1:02:02
Day 3-1:25:15"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,GOATed one🐐
Mdq1WWSdUtw,excuse me please reply the courses you are providing analyst the builder are they free
Mdq1WWSdUtw,sir i some pandas groupby not working if not mention numeric so.. we have to put mean(numeric_only =  True) then it runs
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Amazing video
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"so resourceful... quality speaks in the room, feeling it."
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"44:05 for the ones struggling here at- 
group_by_frame.mean()
Use group_by_frame.mean(numeric_only=True)"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,27:20
Mdq1WWSdUtw,2:19:14 Use df.corr(numeric_only= True) if df.corr() is not working
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"@1:45:32 For panda 2.2.2 and up, the regex default is FALSE instead of TRUE, use:

df[""Phone_Number""] = df[""Phone_Number""].str.replace(""[^a-zA-Z0-9_]"","""",regex=True)
df"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"This was amazing, thank you Alex! I have watched the full video without skipping a second of it and learned a ton."
Mdq1WWSdUtw,You sir owe an apology to dyslexic community 😅 @53:50
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Thanks a bunch!!
Mdq1WWSdUtw,May you please put links to the data sets in the description
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Very well structured and organized content and explained with simplicity. Many Thanks @alextheanalyst
Mdq1WWSdUtw,@Alex can you give me this this tutorial in pdf
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Such a useful video! Can you please show how to clean up dates?
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"1:44:42 
3 rows which have number in format 0000000000 got Nan value why 
And how to fix it?"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"@1:48:55 formatting the phone number with lambda function does NOT work, we have to handle if the phone number is missing or not a 10 digit first...
CODE:
 import numpy as np

# Define a function to format phone numbers 
def format_phone_number(x):
    if pd.isna(x) or len(x) != 10: 
        return np.nan # Return NaN if the phone number is missing or not 10 digits 
    return x[0:3] + '-' + x[3:6] + '-' + x[6:10] 

# Apply the formatting function 
df3['Phone_Number'] = df3['Phone_Number'].apply(lambda x: format_phone_number(str(x))) 
print(df3)

Courtesy of Copilot

Thank you @AlexTheAnalyst for the video!"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"2:03:30 

This will work for making 'NNN' to 'N'

df['Do_Not_Contact']=df['Do_Not_Contact'].str.strip(' ').replace(' ', 'N')"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"I downloaded this zip file from GitHub but when I copy the path in python it is returning a not found error, How do I do it?"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"If anyone is facing pandas deprecation for regex snippet, use:
df['Phone_Number'].str.replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', regex = True)"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Hi All, I need help for th GroupBy section. I'm getting error while applying aggregator on group_by_frame.

group_by_frame = df.groupby('Base Flavor')   --> run succesfully
 
group_by_frame.mean()      --> gave error

TypeError: Could not convert ChocolateRocky RoadChocolte Fudge Brownie to numeric"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Thanks for the knowledge sharing sir. Since when I started  watching your JavaScript tutorial, it was understandable and clear."
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Make a video where you fetch data of the Olympic 2024 medalists using web scraping and display it on the frontend using Flask or Streamlit, with a feature for filtering as well. This project will give many ideas, and there isn't a video like this on YouTube."
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Hey thank you for making the best content
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Hello Alex. This line is not working **fl.groupby('Base Flavor').mean()**. 
I see error TypeError: agg function failed [how->mean,dtype->object]. But it is working on your jupyter?"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,so excited for this. I'm going to kill my procrastination and i will finish this :) thank you Alex.
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Thanks!
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Now do it again, but for Polars - the superior dataframe library! It's WAY faster, can handle WAY more data, uses WAY less memory, the API is MUCH cleaner (i.e. more readable) and I truly believe it's the future of dataframe libraries.

I say that after using Pandas for 2 years, and Polars for 2 months. No more abusing the index, when you really just want to do a group_by."
Mdq1WWSdUtw,It is needed ❤
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"hi
is that work in notebook in Microsoft Fabric ???"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Thanks! If this tutorial is half of the quality compared to the latest SQL tutorial, then it is really worth watching 👌"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"Man....the quality you are providing free of any penny, is amazing. Salute to your contribution to community man"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Another save in my coding playlist
Mdq1WWSdUtw,you sir are a GEM !! thank you so much
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Great stuff Alex! Thanks for sharing
Mdq1WWSdUtw,@2:02:39  I believe it is best practice to avoid using for loops since the pandas operations are built on numpy and are vectorized. You can do something like df.loc[df['Do_Not_Contact'] != 'Y'] to filter out the y's and then set that whole column to N with df['Do_Not_Contact'] = 'N'
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"we need matplotib, seaborn that are used only in data analyst, can you do that"
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Спасибо Вам огромное! Вот это действительно очень полезный урок!
Mdq1WWSdUtw,"For merge, I use left_on and right_on when the columns that I am merging on have different names in the two tables."
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Alex do you added any new topics in this video or is it same as the one in the bootcamp ? @Alex
Mdq1WWSdUtw,Thank you for the video

t1fQBD4B7xk,"Hi Alex, in the section of BeautifulSoup, the get requests gives me an OSError. What could be causing it? Thank you"
t1fQBD4B7xk,Super tutorial 🔥. Now I feel that the real power of python . Thank you Alex
t1fQBD4B7xk,"1st time watching python tutorial, oh boy am I not confused🤥...."
t1fQBD4B7xk,"the function tutorial at 1:20:28 , please note that **number in this case is defining any type of variable, not just integers, for example if you want to add to the list in the example, you could say + number[ 'colour'] and further define colour = 'red' ( in this case 'red' in reality isn't a number, but defined in this case as the called variable i.e. **number) . I'd say the better example here is to use **variable instead of **number to explain, cuz it is really a name to be defined not a type of data. Could also be called **name / **facts or whatever"
t1fQBD4B7xk,Thanks for your video.
t1fQBD4B7xk,Learned a lot for you thank you

OT1RErkfLNQ,im unable to get schema
OT1RErkfLNQ,"1:30:22 Hope that was sarcasm 
BTW great course, thank you."
OT1RErkfLNQ,"I think there might be an error in the exploratory data analysis section.
I ran into issues with total_laid_off, funds_raised_millions, and percentage_laid_off being treated as TEXT instead of numeric types.
I converted total_laid_off and funds_raised_millions to the proper data type (INTEGER). That was probably my mistake during data import.
However, in the tutorial, Alex uses percentage_laid_off as TEXT in aggregate functions. It worked by coincidence, because values like ""1"", ""0.9"", ""0.75"", ""0.5"", etc., maintain the same order both alphabetically and numerically.
Still, I believe best practice is to store all numeric values as numeric types — especially when using SQL, where INTEGER (or FLOAT for decimals) should be used instead of TEXT."
OT1RErkfLNQ,loved this . thanks ..
OT1RErkfLNQ,i was really excited to follow along this tutorial but the repository for parks and recs not the same on github as it is in the video!

OT1RErkfLNQ,superb
OT1RErkfLNQ,"Thank you. at 2:27 - developer default isn't showing up for me as a choice. The full service choice actually has less things than your view of the developer default on minute 3:50, so I guess that's the best I can do."

OT1RErkfLNQ,"why is it showing tables fetching under sql store, not able to see customers, orders items, etc. I have already extracted"
OT1RErkfLNQ,"Hello Alex, I think it's possible to get the total number of employees since we have those laid off and the percentage. i.e (number laid off/total number  * 100 = %laid off) right? To get the total number, we just need to multiply the laid off staff by 100 and divide by the percentage. Am I correct?"

thanks for making sql fun !! 
BUT THIS IS ALL I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SQL FOR DATA ANALYST"

OT1RErkfLNQ,Hi Alex when i downloaded the SQL It did not show the 'developer default' option
OT1RErkfLNQ,i cannot find the dataset on your github need help
OT1RErkfLNQ,Is this enough for landing a data engineer role in USA (for the SQL part alone )
OT1RErkfLNQ,"Literally followed the step by step process to install mySQL and i got stuck on the installer for 2+ hours, maybe this isn't for me :("

OT1RErkfLNQ,"Hi Alex, what should I do when I don't have Developer Default Setup?"
rxyLC247h6E,Alex that was a Fantastic Introduction to AWS Quicksight. Thanks.
rxyLC247h6E,if it doesn't let you create Quicksight. You'll have to go to IAM Identity Center and add the application
rxyLC247h6E,"Hello, great video.  Have a question. In QuickSight, I have set up the standard calendar and have the ability to choose a date and send it as a parameter to the backend query. In the calendar itself is there a way to mask dates > today? It should be something straightforward. PowerBi has this facility.  Something like an option ""Click to mask the dates greater than today's date)"" and then when the Calendar pops up I have only until today.  Is there  a simple way to do programatically?"
rxyLC247h6E,"Hi Alex,

I followed your YouTube tutorial on Amazon QuickSight because I simply wanted to explore the service for learning purposes. Unfortunately, the video did not mention that once the Free Tier limit is exceeded, AWS immediately bills the full monthly amount for QuickSight. I enabled the service exactly as shown and have now been charged more than USD 600 in just a few days.

As a student with a very limited budget and no commercial projects, this unexpected expense is horrible. I had assumed I would remain within a free-tier or low-cost environment while experimenting."
rxyLC247h6E,"Btw, 'Save as Analysis' saves a copy of your current report/ analysis. In QS the report/analysis saved automatically, once you started it, it just there. Forever. Also, the only way you can delete it if you go to list of reports, if you search for it - you wont be able to delete it. It so so basic, but is getting better!"
rxyLC247h6E,To summarize: quicksight is the equivalent of tableau or power bi
rxyLC247h6E,Plz tell me i used these tool from my android phone love from india 🇮🇳
rxyLC247h6E,Hi Alex could you please make a playlist for Google cloud just like you have for AWS and Azure it's a sincere request🙏
rxyLC247h6E,"The main data variable is not related to the other variables and I have not found which graph is correct for my data and I have not found any test. Sir, what company's data is there? As a data analyst, he always said that we get this insight from data. please guide to me"
rxyLC247h6E,Thanks Alex
rxyLC247h6E,Was looking for a video to learn whether quicksight is a good competitor to Power BI. Thanks for the info!
rxyLC247h6E,"Hey Alex, QuickSight is easy to get started, but you’re right, it not as robust at other systems.  

I’ve been trying to figure out how to create a menu. Similar to Pluralsight Flow. 

Example Menu: 
Sales 
- Q1 
- Q2  
Inventory 
- Product A 
- Product B 

Clicking on Q1 or Q2 will load content into the existing sheet. 

Is that possible in QuickSight?"
rxyLC247h6E,First to get here.. thanks Alex

Vg6ys_JvXzg,"I have a question, I’m working on my bachelors for business administration. I think learning data analytics is going to be super beneficial, as I climb the ladder into my next position, I will drop in pay due to going to salary and losing overtime. Do you think it would be practical doing data analysis on the side with the large amounts of down time I will have moving into the new position ? I’ve done the position before so I know I will have plenty of computer time. Just not sure how effective I will be not focusing a full times work into data analysis. 
Sorry for the long comment/question! 
Thanks !"
Vg6ys_JvXzg,"Sir,
When will you release a separate course on advanced DAX on your website ??

SQLBI course is very expensive  !"

Thank you Alex for helping us, I am a Zimbabwean based in South Africa"
Vg6ys_JvXzg,I missed it noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Vg6ys_JvXzg,Aww man I missed the giveaway!!! Well if your feeling generous please would love the Tableau Course or the Azure Cloud Course 😬
Vg6ys_JvXzg,Thank a lot for your time and work!

sge9qTf8GdY,"A big thank you for the concise and comprehensive Azure ADF video. Everything — ADF instance, managed identity, pipeline, and dataflow — is working perfectly for me. 👍😃"
sge9qTf8GdY,just a heartfelt thank you for this sir!
sge9qTf8GdY,"Nice video, crisp and clear ..

I am trying to use ADF to migrate the data from BigQuery DB --> SQL Server OnPrem.

1. Full Refresh
2. Daily Delta update

Have you tried this use case? any challenge you guys faced ??
Also how is the pricing for using this Service ??"
sge9qTf8GdY,"Thank you for the video but i didn't understand anything from this video, from the start i had no idea what we wanted to achieve and as the video continued I got even more lost. I know you spend alot of time for these videos and I appreciate it. I think I am too beginner to understand it right now."
sge9qTf8GdY,"Hi @AlexTheAnalyst, Please I'm stuck. i did ran the code but it's still failing when testing connection. i might be doing something wrong."
sge9qTf8GdY,"Hi Alex, I'm still getting the same connection error, though I have configured Azure data studio with the provided connecting SQL code."
sge9qTf8GdY,"Hi , i am getting errors because of the change in IP each time   , should i enable allow azure services to access this server in the firewall  settings  ?"
sge9qTf8GdY,"Fix error: Connection failed error in Azure data Factory

You can follow the steps below:
1. Go to ""SQL databases"" and click on the name (e.g., AlexDB).
2. Scroll down and select ""Configure"".
3. Find the word ""Exceptions"" and check the box for ""Allow Azure services and resources to access this server.""
4. Test connection again."

sge9qTf8GdY,Where do I find the start of this series?
sge9qTf8GdY,"Thank you you for this video 
I’m wondering if you can do some videos for power bi service, that would be helpful too"
sge9qTf8GdY,"thank you for the video, I spend about 90 min in the first 10 min for a connection failing issues in the DF after fixing some stuff the tables wasn't showing also after a lot of research I just closed the tab and open it and IT WORKED more mad than happy though 🙃😂"

sge9qTf8GdY,"Alex, do you have a course  Data Engineering/Azure?"
9ur0OpMADuM,8:47
9ur0OpMADuM,Loved this.
9ur0OpMADuM,Thanks for posting this. When I started learning programming 30 years ago if I wanted to learn something I'd have to buy a $50 book or go to college.  Now I just go on youtube.
9ur0OpMADuM,"Please i dont understand , where does Alex take the data that he pasted on 10:09 ?"
9ur0OpMADuM,"I can’t find the import navigator, I would love to import files"
9ur0OpMADuM,"Azure Data Studio will be retiring on February 28, 2026. I used VS Code instead."
9ur0OpMADuM,does it require subscription?
9ur0OpMADuM,I put the 500th like. Happy Friday!
9ur0OpMADuM,"Login failed for user '<token-identified principal>'., what's this error code"
9ur0OpMADuM,"It's really helpful, thank you."
9ur0OpMADuM,"I cannot connect to my db on Data Studio. Error says User Account not found on MSAL Cache, please add linked account or refresh account credentials. How to proceed  ?"
9ur0OpMADuM,"this is great, really appreciate it. one question, I  don't see Power Platforms in the left pane, and when I search for Power Bi, I get an error saying you can't use PB with personal account. I'm using the trial subscription."
9ur0OpMADuM,"Heads up people if you have a vpn on while setting this up it may affect the connection step, almost lost my mind. Switch off the vpn, refresh your credentials in azure data studio (un-add then re-add the account) close it, do this step again 07:51 and follow from there."
9ur0OpMADuM,"At first i thought that it would be a lausy and long tutorial, but it turns out this video is excellent, and thanks again Alex. Your sound is clear bright and chillful throughout the video! Thx!"
9ur0OpMADuM,I had an issue where Azure Data Studio it wouldn't show me my database when trying to make a new connection. If this happens to you I solved it by deleting the cache files located at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\azuredatastudio\Azure Accounts and then restarting Azure Data Studio.
9ur0OpMADuM,"I love your content! Since it's under the Creative Commons Attribution license, I've uploaded some of your videos to my YouTube channel. Thank you!

9ur0OpMADuM,"Can you please upload advanced level Data Analytics projects for experienced professionals portfolios in Excel, SQL and Power BI 🏂"
9ur0OpMADuM,Do video on how to clear azure AZ 900 certificate it helps a lot
9ur0OpMADuM,"Alex, thank you for this video! Yesterday I tried to create SQL server on Azure myself, but stucked...and today I foud your video, repeated all steps and done my issue!"
9ur0OpMADuM,Sql databases are going to be taken over by Fabric ecosystem.
9ur0OpMADuM,How do I get started educating myself to become a Data Analyst?
UTMuL_86gSQ,hi alex   Is this course still free or has the offer ended? Just wanted to confirm before signing up. Thanks in advance!
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Is the ""land a job course"" included in any of the bundles?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Sir  that entire stuff  enough to get a job
UTMuL_86gSQ,Is learning from your YouTube channel(Bootcamp) enough for becoming a data analyst ? Because I don't have that much money to buy your course.
UTMuL_86gSQ,I have started today see you next 6 months.
UTMuL_86gSQ,I would have gone for the course but my country doesn't have international payment system ..so i guess I will have to wait till it gets available for free in youtube🎉
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Is the course on ur website free ?
Coz i am looking for hands-on practice for all topics"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hi will there be a new discount code for the course? i really want to buy the lifetime access bundle
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Is this an industry recognized Certification? Or just ""certificates of completion?""

I've seen you, and many other data analysts saying Google DA Certifiate is not good enough even for entry level positions because recruiters and hiring managers want professional ""certification"" versus ""certificates od completion."" 

That said, the Coursera and Google stuff is a good starting point to learn, but won't get you an interview. Is your Analyst Builder Roadmap more like the Coursera stuff or more like the actual ""certifications"" from Microsoft or Tableau?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Will I have access to the data analyst roadmap if I subscribe to the monthly plan?
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hellow Alex if you can make an interview or can bring a hiring manager what they expect from a fresher and how to answer the questions correctly that will be helpful to many people I assume
UTMuL_86gSQ,I am a great fan of your bootcamp. I am watching your video 2021. I am a continous learner. Love to see if I miss anything valuable.
UTMuL_86gSQ,Has anyone gotten a job by doing datacamp? Just curious (:
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi Alex! Thanks for sharing your roadmap, it’s super helpful. I have a quick question: If I want to take your MySQL Advanced course, should I do it right after the first MySQL course, or wait until after completing Excel for Data Analytics and the other ones? Also, are you planning to create an Advanced Python Programming course in the future? Thanks in advance! 🙌"
UTMuL_86gSQ,I'm trying to learn a skill beside my main work I want to know is D.A. is relevant in 2025 with a lot of ai developments. Sorry it might not be a great question.
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I hope I'm not being rude by asking this, but how would this compare to the Google or IBM data analyst courses on Coursera? How is it better? Why should we choose this over them?

They also offer certificates that can be put on our LinkedIn and I assume they'll be better recognized than the ones from Analyst Builder.

In terms of pricing your Road map is $150 (I assume to get access for forever). 

Coursera plus is $400 per year. But I'm getting it for $240 right now till 2nd Dec. And for those in Asia, Africa or East Europe. They can get it for $140 for one year if they get it before 20 Jan 2025.
With Coursera plus for a year you could do multiple courses and not just the one on data analysis.

Now in older videos of 2021 it has been mentioned the Google and IBM had monthly charges. But I've not seen that anywhere in November of 2024. 

So if I'm missing something in terms of money required, or better learning experience please don't hesitate to correct me."
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I would like to know what you would choose between your courses and Google DA.  I would like to attend both, but I don't know which one first. I'm someone with no background experience."
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey Alex,Make a video on the future of Data Analytics...!"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Is becoming a data analyst still worth it  for 2025? I want a career change and i been seeing vidoes about data analytics and its interesting but people say since its so saturated that its hard to find a job especially if you dont have experience idk what to do lol
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hello Alex, how would this course compare to that of the google certificate course. Would employers view it equally or should I try to finish both courses. Thanks!"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Will we get lifetime access in this course if we buy
UTMuL_86gSQ,I know it’s a tough job market but will this roadmap likely to get someone hired on its own or does one need a related degree as well to get hired?
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Started listening to the Data Career Podcast and came across your channel! I started the IBM DA course on Coursera, and was a good ways into Python, but I felt I was just consuming content. Labs were okay but not as in depth as I needed. 

I have been content dumping on your channel man. You make it easy to learn and get motivated to learn more! Can’t wait to start the roadmap"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Alex creat something for the african market because the exchange rate the dollar is high
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I had the original $99 starter package, is there a way to upgrade to the roadmap version?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Thanks for the great work Alex! I want to confirm if the Lifetime Access to Analyst Builder also includes the Analyst Roadmap Bundle. Also can we get a discount for this?
UTMuL_86gSQ,Will there be a sale in the future?
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Great, i am currently doing your data analyst bootcamp for now, does this roadmap is the current needed for data analyst to learn for now?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Amazing Web application
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi @Alex, unfortunately I am a little late on the Roadmap discount 😢, is there any chance that you will create a promo code again? It will be a big help for us especially those unemployed and would like to take DA pathway. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi @Alex, unfortunately I am a little late on the Roadmap discount 😢, is there any chance that you will create a promo code again? It will be a big help for us especially those unemployed and would like to take DA pathway. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
UTMuL_86gSQ,it's been two expensive for students residing outside countries using dollar and I believe everyone have choice to get good education.
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hallo Alex, what level is needed regarding statistics and mathematics. Is it Ok to only have a general understanding or do we need to also take courses on these topics? Thanks for your reply. And for the great job you do. Ritschie23"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"What university certification in DA do you recommend? (Certification, not masters)"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"If I purchase the monthly subscription, does the discount apply every month?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,when i m done with yours important things in you tube than i will come to your analyst builder
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Wow amazing, really wanna get the life time access. Any chance we have discount code for that bundle too 😉"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Great work Alex. Proud to see how far you have come.
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hello Alex, do we have to need paid versions of software like excel,tableau etc which we are using throughout the roadmap? One thing i have core i5 11th gen lenovo laptop. Will it be suitable for this?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hello Alex and Thank you for the immense work that are you doing with your platform. I have a question will you add more real life projects to the courses? Thank you very much
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Thanks @Alex The Analyst. Can you help by allowing installment payment with Klarna and co, for 3 months installments"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey Alex , i just wanted to be a data analyst coz you use the office to explain most of your content,  really appreciate it ❤😂"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Thanks for what you do Alex. You are a blessing to us all that are transitioning from a particular field to the data analytics field.i am from Nigeria and I am interested in this roadmap. Can a friend in the united states make a payment for me to get it.
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hello Alex. How where should I use ""Code for 25% off: ROADMAP"" ?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Is your complete data analyst playlist enough??
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Im thinking about taking a bachelor's in germany, what course should i take one related with cs or data science .I want to become a data scientist"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Nice work Alex. I will covet your level of growth on my channel as well. You rock!
UTMuL_86gSQ,Will my BA in Applied Mathematics put me ahead of other applicants along with sql excel etc knowledge?
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi Alex, this looks great! Would you say that if I finish ""mega course bundle"" I would have a good chance to land a data analytics job?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Can we get Power BI (Advanced) in the roadmap or YouTube. So we have an option to choose either Tableu or Power BI
UTMuL_86gSQ,"This is great Alex, I've tried the preview of your excel course and it is great, quick question though, if I purchase the life time access to Analyst Builder, would that include future courses as well, or just the current ones on the platform?

Thanks!"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Thanks you Alex! For Data Visualization, can you include Power BI as well?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I'm doing your free bootcamp right now, but I'm the type of person that needs to see things twice in order to learn it properly. So I'm definitely going to jump on this. Alex you freaking rock man. Thank you!"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Do you think completing this roadmap will be equally as respected since it’s “self taught” compared to a degree? I’m also out of Indiana so I’m not sure what companies are looking for data analysts other than maybe L3
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi Alex, I am considering on enrolling to your courses. Can I use macbook for this?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I've been using Analyst Builder for a few months, and it has been fantastic. The platform's intuitive interface and powerful features have significantly streamlined my data analysis tasks. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enhance their analytical capabilities."
UTMuL_86gSQ,"There's absolutely no reason to learn any of these skills when AI can literally automate 90% of  all you'll do, within 10 seconds. Data analysis is probably THE most AI automated field. Sorry, but when you really think about it..."
UTMuL_86gSQ,I've been juggling from one roadmap to the other for months now.. you've done a great work on this one Alex
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hi Alex. I love the certification after every completed course. I’m really interested in the roadmap. Is there option for installmental payment fo people in Africa. I’m in Nigeria.
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey Alex, please upload more advanced level data Analytics projects for experienced professionals in sql and power bi"
UTMuL_86gSQ,how many months it will take to complete the course?
UTMuL_86gSQ,Hi Alex! I want to purchase the cloud course and it has been mentioned that along with the lectures two projects are included. Could you please give me an idea about what is included in the projects? Thanks!
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi Alex, Im from India and these courses as per our currency are highly priced.. can you make it more affordable in India, its a huge market"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Do you have Purchase Payment Parity for people who will like to buy from countries with poor exchange rates?
UTMuL_86gSQ,I am a complete noob with sql and Python.  Is this course fit for a complete beginner?
UTMuL_86gSQ,👍👍
UTMuL_86gSQ,"I have bought previously bundle, how it possible to include the data road map ORELSE, is there any differences?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"hi Alex, Is it after the completion of the course and the construction of the project to be ready for the labor market."
UTMuL_86gSQ,Statistics kicked out? It's no longer an essential requirement for Data Analysts?
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi Alex, Thanks for what you are doing.  I have completed your youtube bootcamp which led me to buy lifetime access to Analyst builder, Do I need any other bundle or is it enough for practicing real life projects,"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Lol, skill batches look like StarCraft 2 league icons."
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey Alex, is there a way to pay for each step of the roadmap alone till i complete that step and decide if i want to pay for the next one?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,Does the course help walk you through the process of a project? I’m having the most trouble connecting the dots from the skills to running through an actual data set/project. Looks awesome though just browsing through so far!
UTMuL_86gSQ,Udemy and Coursera will not be happy 😂😂😂
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Great video, thanks! I am following your playlist to become a data analytics"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey Alex, just a quick query before I head on to enroll.

I have M2 pro base mac. Is it good enough to go till advanced stuff; like excel, etc.. because I only have Microsoft 365 subscription, which does not have many features as compared to Windows excel?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey, Alex do you need to do the YouTube boot camp first then do the roadmap?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Heck yeah, time to learn. Never tried Udemy, but Coursera is too outdated to follow along anymore."
UTMuL_86gSQ,Letss goo
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hey Alex, have you added the EMI option on the Analyst Builder yet?

I really want to buy the Lifetime bundle, but it's a lot of money for me to pay all at once."
UTMuL_86gSQ,hello can i learn your data analysis bootcamp free cource in utube now beacuse the cource was of 2023 please reply
UTMuL_86gSQ,When you will include PBI?
UTMuL_86gSQ,Exactly what I need. I was looking into bootcamps but this is a better option. Thank you!
UTMuL_86gSQ,When will you upload free course.. related to job search
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Finally you tempted me and bought the course with the discount , hoping to learn new things"
UTMuL_86gSQ,But sir this too much for Indian students
UTMuL_86gSQ,Exactly what I’ve been looking for and I highly respect your videos! Thank you!!!
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Please Alex, how much is the course and  how do you help us in Countries like Nigeria where the exchange rate is hell?
Please i really anticipate your reply!"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"The free courses are great, and I thank you for sharing them, but please consider there are countries where the salary is twice the price of the lifetime bundle. I mean, you don't have to make it affordable, just saying, maybe you can add installments?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Thank you Alex, it's time to be focuseɗ at least i have a roadmap to follow now"
UTMuL_86gSQ,"This was the sign I needed. I just enrolled in the Roadmap. I am an Accounts Receivable Specialist, and i use mainly PowerBi to pull reports. I've been looking to transition to DA, so I hope this course will teach me what i need to learn to land a job."
UTMuL_86gSQ,"wow awesome work Alex, I am currently on my way to become a data analyst."
UTMuL_86gSQ,The best video. Thanks for this Alex. Keep doing best
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hi Alex. How common is working as a data analyst fully remotely? If anyone else reading this have experiences willing to share, please do."
UTMuL_86gSQ,I can’t see any Google Cloud courses here or am I looking at the wrong place? A good Gen AI and LLMs Machine Learning and AI roadmap would be nice too.
UTMuL_86gSQ,Naa!!! This is awesome Alex. Thank you for this 🙌🏽
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Thank you Alex for helping analysts so selflessly ❤😊
I would like to ask if this roadmap appropriate for someone living in 3rd world country? I mean is it equally feasible for everyone regarding job search? Thanks"
UTMuL_86gSQ,❤
UTMuL_86gSQ,"Hello Alex, I Know Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Excel, Power BI, Database(DBMS, SQL, DW, ETL), Python(Basics, OOPs, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib Seaborn Scipy, Plotly, Statmodels) is enough to be become a Fresher, Entry-level Data Analyst in India and us?"
UTMuL_86gSQ,You the best
sEImMaovc1Q,11:15
sEImMaovc1Q,"Hi Alex! If I want to export BigQuery data, for example from Google Analytics to create a PowerBI dashboard, should I use a  ""Queue"" process to automatically get and storage the data in Azure?"
sEImMaovc1Q,"You videos are really helpful. I find it hard to land a data analyst job interview. I have more than 7 year experience with ssrs, sql and ms data analyst certification and desktop tableau specialistand get 0 interviews due to no experience as data analyst"
sEImMaovc1Q,Cool video as always !
sEImMaovc1Q,I have a BA in Applied Mathematics will that be an advantage for me as I apply for DA roles compared to other degrees like Econ Business etc?
sEImMaovc1Q,Alex can you kindly make an azure data engineer bootcamp for us.
sEImMaovc1Q,"Great coincidence for me, just started to learn ADF."
sEImMaovc1Q,How do I get Azure on my laptop?
sEImMaovc1Q,Azure 🙂
sEImMaovc1Q,Azure!🎉

ZYps6TmBkWk,Is it possible to get a playlist for Microsoft fabrics
ZYps6TmBkWk,Thank you for creating this! I will be sending this video to customers for getting their new Azure tenant's set up :)
ZYps6TmBkWk,"Hello Newbie here, about the free 200$ credits , can i use that for paying the computing instance? I'm planning to train an ai model in azure notebooks."
ZYps6TmBkWk,"A quick tip: if you have a Microsoft student account you can go for the ""Azure for students"" subscription which will give you 100$ for the first 12 month"
ZYps6TmBkWk,i'm ready
ZYps6TmBkWk,Please help me

ZYps6TmBkWk,"Hello @Alex_The_Analyst and everyone,
Please i really need your help to sign up on Microsoft Azure, I reside in Nigeria and my debit card is not accepted. Here is the error message ""We’re unable to validate the credit card information you provided"" Please help.🙏

Thank you."
ZYps6TmBkWk,"Don't do it... azure sucks. As soon as you get qualified the goal posts move... not because it got better, because microsoft just like making an industry out of pointless change. Not just that... its an american company and we all know what america is now the UN has acknowledged americas goons in israel are just a bunch of naartsees... veto the bad guys and evolve :)"
ZYps6TmBkWk,"I was looking for this!!!! I saw your post on LinkedIn and noticed there were more videos, are you releasing them like a whole new season on Netflix? That will be awesome 😊. As a data analyst I feel I need some exposure to all this Azure pipelines that the data engineers keep taking about, and I have almost zero knowledge of it."
ZYps6TmBkWk,"Series on satistical analysis and R programming, please"
ZYps6TmBkWk,By doing the course on Analyst Builder platform can i skip this series here? In other words is this series already covered among the course of analyst builder?
ZYps6TmBkWk,"Really appreaciting your work Alex !
Excited to follow the Azure Series as i already have created the account after watching the video."
ZYps6TmBkWk,"Hello alex, i just want to appreciate what you do. i've been following your channel for a while, i completed your excel, sql, power bi courses and i just recently started working for company as a junior data analyst. i just want to thank you, you helped me so much and i couldn't do this without you.  thanks to you because you changed my life, i wish you all the best."
ZYps6TmBkWk,Thank you sir! You are awesome
ZYps6TmBkWk,I appreciate your input on this topic. I’m a big fan of your work.
ZYps6TmBkWk,Thanks 👍 for your great struggling sir 🎉❤
zv1nfZTYpio,"Great video, Alex. In case anyone finds it useful, you could directly generate the choice list as:

zv1nfZTYpio,"Hello @Alex The Analyst, thank you for putting these togeether. I am trying to follow along, but I found that even when I have the same code as you, I have a weird issue. Whenever I change the input in the browser, instead of replacing the previous graph, it just adds another one below it with the new filter. The only thing that appears to be different is that you have Shiny Json in your folder and I do not. Is that important? If no, do you know if there where any updates in the last several months that may have caused these issues? Thanks so much for any help on this."
zv1nfZTYpio,"The problem with the ""United States"" filtering resulting in no data is because this groupby eliminates the ""United States"" row since the StateName is NaN:
 price_grouped = median_listing_price_df.groupby('StateName').mean(numeric_only=True)

If you add this line before it, then all works as expected:
median_listing_price_df['StateName'] = median_listing_price_df['StateName'].fillna("""")

And great video! many thanks."
zv1nfZTYpio,how Shiny is compared to streamlit?
zv1nfZTYpio,"Hey, great and very instructive video ! 
For those that doesn't use the state_choices.py file i used this which seems to also do the job :

for_sale_inventory_df2.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
for_sale_inventory_df2 = for_sale_inventory_df2.sort_values().tolist()
for_sale_inventory_df2.insert(0, ""United States"")
STATE_CHOICES = for_sale_inventory_df2"

zv1nfZTYpio,Please make a complete video on web scraping especially social media websites.
zv1nfZTYpio,"You are such great human, who helps everyone who wants to change their career,  wish you for good future 😊😊"
zv1nfZTYpio,"What’s going on , why voice is too fast in your all videos"
zv1nfZTYpio,Amazing video! Would be immensely useful to see how these can be deployed to a website? That’s my biggest concern rn
zv1nfZTYpio,"I cant figure or understand why i can't just select the state in the filter, and my code is equal to yours :/ it just show the united states all the time, but if selecting the State on the right of the graph i can select them..."
zv1nfZTYpio,great content
zv1nfZTYpio,"Ive been looking into dashboarding options recently, and considered this route.

But I was surprised by Power BI. It seems pretty good, in that it let's you work with python for data importing,cleaning, and visualization.

And then you can rely on the slicer and page layout of Power BI itself."
zv1nfZTYpio,Thank you for this lesson. Shiny really interests me. I tried a bit Streamlit to deploy apps. I like it. But shiny seems to be a very good alternative. I'm gonna give it a try. Thanks for the discovery.
zv1nfZTYpio,"Hi Alex, Love your content!
Quick question, how come you are not extracting the data directly from Zillow via API so that it automatically updates every month?"
zv1nfZTYpio,"Hi Alex, I genuinely want to thank you for making this video that goes beyond ""Beginner"" level. I recently made analytical web app though I used #DASH by plotly for that because it gives you far more flexibility in terms of designing. It's fun to check out ❤"
zv1nfZTYpio,What's next? Waiting eagerly
zv1nfZTYpio,In shiny will I be able to connect a dataset to display on a website?
zv1nfZTYpio,टकले तू फिर आगया ❤

However, your videos sparked my love for it again.  You have a unique way of making data interesting.  Thank you for that"
rn0dSsYXhIE,I am currently learning data analysis from your bootcamp videos. Is it mandatory to learn these skills as well?
rn0dSsYXhIE,Wow. This video dropped at the right time. Thanks Alex.
rn0dSsYXhIE,"Hi Alex,

Thank you for your video, which, as always, is awesome.

Alex, I wanted to write to you through some means to deeply thank you for your work. Thanks to you and your recommedantions, I was able to find a job as a data analyst in the logistics sector without any background in the tech sector. I have been working for a while now, and it's a great job.

As important as your recommendations on what skills to learn and in what order to do it were your words of motivation and your example of personal life to keep improving both professionally and personally. I was unemployed for 1 year, and it was a very difficult situation for me, but your videos reenergized me to keep going.

You are a good guy, and I truly wish you all the best in your projects.

Greetings from Venezuela,
Simon Martinez."
rn0dSsYXhIE,"The most insteresting part about shiny is u have almost full control on your layout project, not just using python or R, u can also use HTML (for example) to costumize it. It's really usefull to show ""how our project work"" with various input of data. 

Thankyou verymuch Alex to teach us how to use it with python. U always teach us valuable insight :)"
rn0dSsYXhIE,Thanks 😊
siHou7lObbo,"Great set up tutorial Alex, another great one. But... if I may, if you're going to use VS Code, don't show Anaconda and that you launch VS Code  from the Ananconda navigator, it was very very confusing for a non-professional beginner on web apps, especially if there are extensions to install  run afterwards inside the IDE. Maybe best to show a quick VS Code install. However besides that, thank you so much for sharing shiny to the world! I would have never known about it without you Alex, you're great"
siHou7lObbo,"Hey guys, for some reason rsconnect is not recognised after installing it. Any ideas why?"
siHou7lObbo,"I can’t find the ‘deploy’ menu :(. 
Edit.: Not sure how I did but I got it tysm for the video 😊😊😊!"
siHou7lObbo,Hi - Thank you for this video. I continue to get the response that RS Connect is not found or that command doesn't exist (mac user btw); Also the VS Code extension can't seem to load the sample code downloaded. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
siHou7lObbo,"Hi Alex, great video, but what would be the differences with Dash Plotly? mostly the advantages"
siHou7lObbo,Thank you for this very useful video!

siHou7lObbo,Oh so happy this is the next topic you are tackling! I think Shiny is great and I am so happy its available for Python now.
siHou7lObbo,"Amazing video.
can you tell us what is the differences between shiny and streamlit?"
siHou7lObbo,Allah has created you for us.
siHou7lObbo,I’ve always wanted to try Streamlite but never found good tutorials. It looks like I will give shiny a blast.

wJiJXD7MVoY,"This was a great video, I would be interested in you doing a longer, more in-depth video along these lines."
wJiJXD7MVoY,make a recap after 1 year and update your prediction
wJiJXD7MVoY,😮 sh!t
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Please give more information beyond quarter 2, 2024"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Cool❤
wJiJXD7MVoY,This video was very insightful! I would love for you to dig deeper into the information in this video!
wJiJXD7MVoY,Thank you for your video with the data analysis and charts. This video is much better than just talking about opinions.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Please make the full version.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Economy is strong. Demand is strong. Wages increase. That why the FED keeps interest rate high. Thats the REALITY you denied. The high demand pull prices high because peoples have money. Stock market beat record after record and rich/wise people take advantage of it. Maybe you cannot affortd house, then invest in the stock market."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Yes, I’d like a longer video with a deeper dive into data."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I am 28 and i have been living for this exact moment. ""I"" (me and my wife) bought small affordable apartment in central city paid it off in 4 years then saved money for 4 years for next big recession to buy property of people who went too big. Only bad thing is i left my job to learn to become data analyst working as trainee. Was in finance before. My best indicator is when they start giving my mother loans and this day came 2 months ago. She has toddler skills with money and has been in trouble with the money whole her life."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I’m not arguing against your credit card debt point, but I’m curious how many more credit card users there are in 1999 vs 2024. Regardless, the point stands that people borrowing more to finance their lives is unhealthy."
wJiJXD7MVoY,i wonder how many people got radicalized after watching this 😭
wJiJXD7MVoY,Doing that video about housing would be really fascinating Alex
wJiJXD7MVoY,"YES!! This was a great plain language analysis from am agnostic.  More like this!! More on the housing market!! 

Thro in some MonteCarlo sim too!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I'd really like to see data about household defaults and collapsing businesses, I do believe you have a point, however showing nominal increase without specifying the real increase (as a percentage, say, when you sholw nominal increase in credit debt - show the relation to avg spending or avg income). when you do that - i'd love to see a full video. BTW, let me know if I can help analysing the data:)"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Alex from this video i understand the significance of data storytelling skill. Very good content. Need more contents like this
wJiJXD7MVoY,I would love too see the longer version of this video!
wJiJXD7MVoY,"You should also take into consideration FOMO. The society as of the last 4-5 years due to crypto and stocks has been experiencing FOMO. Its not just in stocks or crypto, games, services, all prompt exclusive never coming back services, its a whole new marketing trend that I feel is leaving a giant psychological impact. 

I love data, and I love your videos. Thank you so much for your analysis please make a longer video ❤"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Hey Alex from Uzbekistan we still love you and support , can you make video with tech side of prediction and make creazy chat bar and other vizualize bro , have grate next few years bro  "
wJiJXD7MVoY,thanks for telling the truth.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Very informative
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Definitely, the current economic instability is causing a lot of concern. With factors like trade tensions and fluctuating markets, it's hard to predict what's coming next."
wJiJXD7MVoY,Great presentation. Would love to see another video going deeper
wJiJXD7MVoY,Please dive in more on this topic.  This is really important and a wake up call for me because this has been happening to my friends but somehow I kept on thinking the economy is going well.  It really is time to save.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I really liked what you have said, and it is true to some extent.

But you have missed a key point here. Feds are likely to start reducing the interest rates from September, again the money circulation in the market will see an uptrend and business will again start hiring full time and mortgage will be cheaper and things will improve."
wJiJXD7MVoY,I really could tell this was starting to happen myself. Just getting into learning data analytics myself and glad to see a video reviewing actual data and how it reflects to real life is really interesting!
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I would love to see more analysis videos like this, could be related to anything.. This is a good idea in this time today!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Superuseful tips 🙏
Subscribed!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"i'm not a doomsday prepper too, but i start saving since last year
buy gold, not for investment but for stability, paper money would go down when inflation up"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"This video was very enlightening and educational please make another longer video where you deep dive in to the topic about your forecast from the data perspective of the housing, loans and car market. Thank you."
wJiJXD7MVoY,I totally agree with you but sure hope you are Wrong
wJiJXD7MVoY,GREAT VIDEO!
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Where the data does show that home selling prices are rising, it's not because homes in general are becoming more expensive. It's because only the rich people (top 20%) are buying homes. The lower incomes families are not buying because of interst rates, as you point out. Follow Melody Wright: https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxGNeo_JKvx6hc-mqzkiKdKWiaCCrvMiIg?si=WuUU2pqF1piOlIrl"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Fantastic topic of discussion. More please! 🤙🏽
wJiJXD7MVoY,"“The Markets are never wrong, Opinions often are.” - Jesse Livermore 

(Made $1.6 Billion in today’s money during the 1929 depression shorting the market)

Go read the “Beige Book” from the FOMC back during 1978-1982 we are literally doing exactly the same thing and the FOMC is saying the exact thing today as they did back then. Before the recession they talked about high inflation, retail spending was high, gas went from $0.25 to $0.45-$0.47 a gallon , job reports were still good but layoffs were starting, residential housing was starting to slow down, and the auto industry was slowing down. It’s literally a mirror of today from back then in the late 70’s and early 80’s."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Spot on Alex!!!  I been thinking the same for the past few months - another looming massive impact is A.I. - when companies (in certain industries) layoff because the same amount of work can be done by half (or less) their current staff using AI tools.  Yes, please post more videos as you mention are possible."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Hey Alex, very interesting analysis. I would love to see an extended version diving into the other data you mentioned. Thank you!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"This was fantastic, thank you so much for making this video. You did a great job explaining the entire history, even to somebody who is not well versed in economic concepts. Great stuff!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Interesting how a senior economist like Paul Krugman is a lot more optimistic about the economy. I appreciate your analysis simply because you're not some partisan ideologue.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Do that longer video.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Don't worry guys, NVDA produced chips will train LLMs that are gonna replace all the laid-off workers, SPY to 1000
(this is a joke, we're fucked)"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Alex totally agree with you, if you have some more data to show or what are you doing to prepare for a possible depression should be really help full.  Than you so much for your time."
wJiJXD7MVoY,The impact of Brexit on the UK economy would make a good project!
wJiJXD7MVoY,Wow!! Thank you for giving us a full pov on the current state of the economy & beyond. Can't wait to see the full video about this topic!
wJiJXD7MVoY,I would like to see a VERY deep dive on this topic.  I thought I was the only one seeing these trends.  Thank you for creating this content
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Oddly enough, I was taking a look at some of this data earlier this week and had similar thoughts. People are saying the economy is doing so well but the data simply does not support those claims when you really dig into it.

The prophet Alex has spoken. I'd love to see a deeper dive into this from you."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Hi Alex, thank you for sharing your point of view based on accurate data. I would to watch another video talking about housing market. Thank you."
wJiJXD7MVoY,Love the flow in your analysis. Looking forward to hearing more about what we are about to face 🙏 May God Bless Everyone!
wJiJXD7MVoY,This is awesome. Might need a video series with deep dives. I learned more here than listening to Wall Street everyday.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Yes please. Deep dive. Great video.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Love your stuff. I would love to see the hour long analysis of this subject.
wJiJXD7MVoY,“I want to go to Bali! I want to go to France”! Hehe 😂
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I would honestly love to get a deeper dive into this, the data speaks volumes of the current state of the economy!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Thank you for this video. Please dive deeper into this. That would be awesome!
wJiJXD7MVoY,Will the US government come for you? If not then please make more videos like this 😉
wJiJXD7MVoY,please make more
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Finally, find insights and take necessary actions is the essence of data analyst!"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Please dig in deeper!! Amazing content!!
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Thank you so much Alex
I prepared Upsc for 3 years and then moving towards data science, it will help to connect broad picture"
wJiJXD7MVoY,"The emperor wears no clothes, and the can has been kicked to the end of the road - contrary to the constant propaganda of the ruling ""elites"" and their mainstream media lapdogs. I'd love to see an analysis on the actual REAL inflation rate for average folks...shadow stats usually says it's around 17%."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I wanted to make this analysis for my  dissertation, I couldn’t find appropriate data to use 😅.
Well done Alex. 
Will be looking forward to something on exchange rates too if you don’t mind 😊"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Really appreciate your effort in informing people and helping them prepare!
wJiJXD7MVoY,I love this video. Dive in more. And teach us how to get and analyse this data
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Please make a longer video, Alex.  Excellent, fact-based, forecast.  Mahalo."
wJiJXD7MVoY,I like your analysis. Love to watch detailed videos on the housing market and coming recession.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Teach us how to search for and analyze the data.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Guys, if you have to worry about America, then the rest of us is fucked.
Especially now, with spending bills and space for lowering interest rates, long-term outlook for US economy is very, very good.
People having credit means people having money, trustworthy, honest people.
It might be bumpy, stupid or even unnecessary what will come, but it will be dealt with."
wJiJXD7MVoY,Good
wJiJXD7MVoY,So true! Media try to fool us.
wJiJXD7MVoY,More please
wJiJXD7MVoY,Love the video! I would love to see a longer video about the housing/rental market
wJiJXD7MVoY,I love videos like this! Homeowners like myself and future homeowners definitely need information like this to prepare. As s data analyst i know numbers never lie
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Really interesting, wouldn’t mind if you started posting more of these"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Everyone who says there are so many jobs in IT and there's such a shortage that they will take and train anyone is very far removed from the current reality. Its almost impossible for normal (Non ivy league etc) juniors to get into the field right now.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"As suspected, the ""return to office"" was just cover for companies to get people to quit instead of laying them off, and had nothing to do with productivity, ""energy"", or any other nonsense."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Great analysis. Alex proclaims that the emperor wears no clothes, and the can has been kicked to the end of the road - all contrary to the constant propaganda of the ruling ""elites"" and their mainstream media lapdogs. Alex, was the credit card debt data adjusted for what our lying ""elites"" say the inflation rate is? I'd love to see an analysis on the actual REAL inflation rate for average folks...shadow stats usually says it's around 17%."
wJiJXD7MVoY,Would love a detailed video!
wJiJXD7MVoY,"The full time vs part time graph really sells it, that double helix shape 😂"
wJiJXD7MVoY,I don’t think Mr. X knows how the economy works. Just another Trump acolyte doomsayer … Remember how these people told us of mushroom clouds in Iraq and death panel in Obama care? This is their latest schtick.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Please do that Alex! I love the style of these videos (stuff that is current events analysis). 

If I had one comment as a learning DA could you explain how/where you go to find your data? The thought process of why you decided to ask and answer the questions you did."
wJiJXD7MVoY,I would like to see more of a deep dive.
wJiJXD7MVoY,More videos like this please!
wJiJXD7MVoY,Gotta love being a millenial. Those boomers really had it easy in comparisson.
wJiJXD7MVoY,My advice buy gold.
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one feeling ""gloom and doom"""
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I loved the video. Please make a longer, deeper dive."
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Please delve more into a longer video. I prefer to listen to a data analyst than those financial ""gurus"" on YouTube. Thank you."
wJiJXD7MVoY,what surprised me is news kept saying the economy is strong. The feds are saying that. But via YouTube and social media I saw so many pp living in vans and losing jobs
wJiJXD7MVoY,"I had that question seeking for answers for a while and you just answered it!
“using one mortgage to leverage as a bigger mortgage, how will it turns out?” 
I was here for power bi 😂 but thank you so much."
wJiJXD7MVoY,You should interview an economist. How about @MarketPowerYT
wJiJXD7MVoY,Looking forward to a detailed video!
wJiJXD7MVoY,Tell me more!!!
wJiJXD7MVoY,Really great video. As someone who does financial analysis on my own I also do think the pop is coming! Too many signs
wJiJXD7MVoY,"11:00 When the analysis defines ""full time vs pt time"" as binary "">35hr or <35hr"", that gets tricky because during a tough economy, some employers may not necessarily lay off their employees, but rather cut their hourly employee's hours that they work. For example, when the pandemic hit, healthcare got a massive surge in money, and hospitals/pharmacies were able to pay their nurses and techs for 40 hours of work every week. But now with less demand for healthcare services, healthcare is going through budget cuts, so rather than laying off half their staff, they are instead changing their hours worked from 40 hours a week to 32 hours a week."
wJiJXD7MVoY,media lies. use ur commo sense. the economy will collapse soon. the system is gonna collapse.
wJiJXD7MVoY,Deep dive and go further in another video!
wJiJXD7MVoY,"Love these kind of analytics, pls do more"
wJiJXD7MVoY,Please do get in depth
wJiJXD7MVoY,I’m applying for a data science position. Is the field going well in the next few years?

5q2u8__sVhs,Thank you Alex
5q2u8__sVhs,Great functions. I have not seen them before. Thanks for sharing.
5q2u8__sVhs,"For big files with a lot of tricky formulas, I sometimes keep a kind of change tracker on a separate sheet. I make a list of all the formulas in the workbook, use FORMULATEXT to show them as a string, and copy paste as values in a helper column next to it. Conditional formatting to show if the FORMULATEXT differs from the pasted-as-values version, and I can tell at a glance where I made edits (or someone else broke something)."
5q2u8__sVhs,"Hi Alex, your videos have been helping me a lot so I wanted to reach out and extend my thanks and appreciation! You should do a coding booting similar to the data analyst bootcamp where we get a certificate at the end. I'd definitely sign up for it! Keep up the good work :)"
5q2u8__sVhs,🤯🤯🤯😊😊
5q2u8__sVhs,"Hey, Alex. There's actually a little inconsistency in the first method (PMT):

If you take the first monthly payment for ex ($471.78) over the period (5 x 12 months) , you'll get $28,306.8.
But $25,000 capitalized annually at an interest rate of 5% per year will return a Future Value of $31,907.04.

The reason for this is because the compound interest (used preferably in the economy). In order to achieve the same value, you should convert the annual interest rate in monthly interest rate too. 

Thank you for the video."
5q2u8__sVhs,Thank you again Alex
5q2u8__sVhs,That's really amazing Alex. We want more sessions like this. It will be more helpful to reduce the complex works.
5q2u8__sVhs,"I've been following your videos since I was still going through school for business analytics 3+ years ago. I still learn something new every time. I can see most of these having potential use with my current client (which does deal with financial records, but on an operations and audit level)."
5q2u8__sVhs,"Hey Alex sir,
I really like watching your videos, the way you explain is so easy to understand. I am a fresher and starting to explore the field of data analytics. With the help of your videos, I can understand all concepts much faster. 
Thank you so much"
5q2u8__sVhs,"mentor at again

love every info you give out"
5q2u8__sVhs,"As a credit analyst I was regularly using the PMT function to calculate the monthly payments of our clients other debts. Nowadays, I use it to help friends and family have a better idea of what they will be paying for a loan before they take the loan out. You can also use the PPMT and IPMT functions to calculate the principal and interest portions of those payments."

UJbNEH0_nGY,this was amazing! thanks
UJbNEH0_nGY,Hey Alex! Can you do a project in python
UJbNEH0_nGY,Hey I followed your whole Data Analyst bootcamp on freecodecamps channel and i am proud to say after 2 months of grinding ive landed my first data analyst role. Thank you for the knowledge and resources you have provided man 🎉🎉
UJbNEH0_nGY,Thanks Alex! I am going through the Data Analyst Bootcamp and at the Python part but I still enjoy your weekly uploads because I learn something new!
UJbNEH0_nGY,"Hi Alex, I need a help with Analyst Builder platform, I am studying SqL and got a problem with Server connection after install, Then I tried to post on Discord but couldn't Please help me I don't where should I email......"
UJbNEH0_nGY,"Awesome tutorial, Alex unlocked the excel creative mode"
UJbNEH0_nGY,"CTE is not working in MySQL  version 8.03  it is showing syntax error ,
How I can fix this?"
oz2K4HUNMW4,"i have a doubt sir 
can anyone help me i am struggling in doing unguided project is it Good to do youtube projects and understanding the metrics based on it i can do some storytelling  creating dashboards on own is the one i am struggling in 😭😭😭"
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Many companies still rely so heavily on Excel, even though their analytics positions require things like Power BI or Tableau. Excel isn’t going away, like, ever!"
oz2K4HUNMW4,I hate excel.
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Hey Alex your videos are very good and helpful, I can't find some function like XLOOKUP and TEXTSPLIT in my version of excel is this normal?"
oz2K4HUNMW4,Thanks u very much mr alex
oz2K4HUNMW4,Do I need the XLookup when there’s power query and power pivot?
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Hi Alex,

I wanted to express my gratitude to you because I’ve learned a lot from your videos. Three months ago, I started my career as a data analyst, and your content has been incredibly valuable to me. 

Thank you for providing such high-quality content. My best wishes to you!"
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Maybe make a video about differences between google Sheets and Excel, especially that google Sheets will bring fire features at the beginning of next month + many unique functions on google sheets is a game changing like query (sql) or let, and all of that for free"
oz2K4HUNMW4,You can also use Alt + A E to split the text much faster.
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Hi Alex, do you have a video/resource for array formulas and array logic?"
oz2K4HUNMW4,How can I perfect in data analysis please
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Hi Alex,

I started watching your SQL videos last February and since then you are my number 1 teacher here on YT. You explain complex things clearly and made it simple.

I started applying for DA roles this month and on Tuesday, I finally got a job offer!!!!!! I was beyond happy and couldn't believe a career shifter like me has been given an opportunity to work in data analytics. I owe this milestone to you. Words can't express what I truly feel but I still want to say my sincerest gratitude to you. This wouldn't be possible without your tutorials and realistic advices. Gosh I am tearing up. From the bottom of my heart, thank you very much. This is just the start and I will continue on learning new skills and improve myself. I will keep on watching your videos as I navigate the real world of data analytics.

Again, thank you and I salute you. You are the MAN. 🫡🧑‍💻

Truly grateful,
Klay"
oz2K4HUNMW4,hello  can you put some more stuff for the data analytics bootcamp with the use of generative ai
oz2K4HUNMW4,Text to column is more simple than textsplit
oz2K4HUNMW4,Mentor 🥰
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Hi Alex, long time"
oz2K4HUNMW4,*if you have 365
oz2K4HUNMW4,I remember a few years ago when these hipsters showed me XLOOKUP. I'm that grandma in the office who still uses INDEX and MATCH.
oz2K4HUNMW4,"Awesome. I thought you might include Vlookup but I guess, Xlookup has taken that place :)"
oz2K4HUNMW4,Alex please how to i download all those files to work along with you ?
oz2K4HUNMW4,let’s go thanks 🙏🏽
oz2K4HUNMW4,Second.
oz2K4HUNMW4,Much love for XLOOKUP! I get irate when I see people still prattling on about VLOOKUP or Index/Match.
oz2K4HUNMW4,Thank u Alex!!
Y-4ri9QjsTI,"Hey Alex, was something meant to be cut from the video (from 19:00 to 20:36)? Seemed like the transition at 20:36 was very abrupt and there was a bit of overlap with the next section. Maybe I'm overthinking this lmao

Otherwise, really cool to hear more about the behind the scenes development (even if I understand like 2% of it 😂)."
Y-4ri9QjsTI,"Hi
I am commerce graduate 
I intrested data analytics 
Can a bcom graduate become an analyst?
How to become a data analyst"
Y-4ri9QjsTI,this was very informative and it shows the quality of work that goes into building a platform people can trust. welldone to him and his team.
Y-4ri9QjsTI,"Hi Alex, why have you removed the MSSQL videos from the Data Analyst bootcamp playlist, I can't find the videos, thanks."
Y-4ri9QjsTI,Proud of you mate Kasun
Y-4ri9QjsTI,Could you put your friend next to the light instead of you? Thanks for the content
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Appreciate all of your insights,

I’m not sure if you already have this on your page or not but could you do one of these for Data Scientist? 

Thank you!"
F5v2dRYU5IA,18:50
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thankyou!!! Lovely explaintion
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hi Alex, thanks for sharing this video. It is very informative and i would love to learn from these videos. I am interested in Data Analytics and always looking for different websites, articles, videos that can guide me. Recently i learned so much about how to prepare for the Tableau Data Analyst exam on gettableaucertifications. Today i found your video. Hopefully next time, i'd find something even more informative."
F5v2dRYU5IA,"hi alex, regarding the greatest weakness question , what if its communication skills , is it okay to talk about it?"
F5v2dRYU5IA,Now 1million followers
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hi, am on the Analyst Builder and trying to take an easy question but my answer looks right when i compare with the solution of the video. what else am i doing  wrong? if you can assist. Oh by the way, am new on SQL though i have done a course on mySQL"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"You are awesome! Thank you for this phenomenal information... I am going to be going through second-round, rigorous interviews starting next week and I'm nervous even though I have basic SQL and Power BI skills - you've helped me prepare so much!"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"For the first SQL example question at the 1 hour mark, I paused the video and wrote my own query before seeing your answer.

This is what I came up, essentially a table join instead of a subquery. I wonder if this would have still given me the right output?

Select e.Emp_name 
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN test t on t.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE test_date is NULL"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hi Alex, I am here as I have my very first Data Analyst interview coming up! To my surprise, the interview is with the director. No screening call. I got an email from a recruiter a couple hours after I applied who asked me to expand on my experience using SQL. I replied, then she sent that to the hiring manager, then scheduled the interview with the director. I am nervous and excited, and here learning what to expect from this level of interview. I feel a little more prepared after watching this- Thank you!"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Alex, how thankful I am to you. Thank you so much"
F5v2dRYU5IA,any aptitude or logical reasoning round
F5v2dRYU5IA,"I just did a SQL interview for a data analyst role and they got me at, “tell me what a primary key is” 😂 I barely use SQL even tho I’ve gotten A’s in every class.  I spoke to one of my teachers and she told me to work on a couple of projects so I know what I’m talking about."
F5v2dRYU5IA,"For the slide at 56:00, how common or uncommon is it to get hard questions on an entry level role? I have a final technical interview in a few days and am so worried because I definitely feel confident to do the first level and mostly ok with second level (still somewhat struggle with subqueries) but definitely struggle with things beyond that. I’m so nervous and anxious about it. I didn’t really learn SQL anywhere formally just on the job as I’ve needed so I know there’s a lot that I don’t know."
F5v2dRYU5IA,He doesn’t have hair 🤣🤣
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thank you so much for this información. I am from colombia and i recently graduarte as an eléctrical engineer but my dream is to Work as a data analyst and you have helped me a lot in advancing my process
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thank you so much for this información !!
F5v2dRYU5IA,What did I miss?  Why can’t I see the tables when going over the SQL interviews?
F5v2dRYU5IA,"I recently had a frustrating interview experience. On a job description that I felt like I matched perfectly technical and experience wise.

I was upbeat smiling and confident /eager to learn what I might not know during the interview and clearly displayed knowledge of the tech in Questions but I was pre tested before both technically and personality wise - by this consulting recruiter company.

I’m fairly in the middle when it comes to extrovert introvert. But may score slightly one way or the other depending on the test.

I had a 3 person interview and was just grilled me left and right from all three interviewers to the point where they were all interrupting me and each other and they didn’t even ask me to tell me about myself.

I’m hind site I wish I would have slowed them down and been like wait a minute can we go one step at time, I could have answered some of their vaguer questions more in depth.

Felt like a power shit show. 😅 has anyone ever had this? 10 years of job experience and I’ve never had one quite this unprofessional and all over the place.

What do you all do when that happens?"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"""I have autism"" 😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
F5v2dRYU5IA,Please make a video for database developer interview ❤also
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Thanks for this video, I have always been bad at interviews, after watching this video and preparing for a week I landed my first job in IT! Also you are 100% right about wearing a tie - major confidence boost"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"This is so Helpful
Analystbuilder, here I come.
I'm really looking forward to learning and getting better.
Thankl you Alex"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"I've just watched the first 42 minutes and I know you're an honest person,  Alex ;)"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Thank you very much for the video, is there by any chance a way to access these slides ?"
F5v2dRYU5IA,This is gold!  Thank you!
F5v2dRYU5IA,"😂😂😂Alex allow me to laugh about the kidnapping staff😂.

I am watching this because on Monday I have data analyst role interview . I hope I won't be kidnapped 😂"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Seems you were looking for a chatbot rather than an actual experienced person. Not most people are that chatty, and unfortunately, they tend to miss out on many opportunities, and I actually think that it is the employers that miss the most."
F5v2dRYU5IA,jajajabajajba...get going@
F5v2dRYU5IA,Hello thank you so much for this valuable video.
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hi Alex, I tried to purchase SQL interview crash course but the promo code is not applying. It shows ""The code has expired"". Would you mind to fix it and let me know. Thanks"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"You literally are the best! Thank you for everything you do, it's much appreciated"
F5v2dRYU5IA,Can u release power bi course  on your website
F5v2dRYU5IA,"My 2 cents: 
in the information era it's very important to show the most you can, too. 

I'm no developer or what, but I've been wanted for a position where I had to use Python to retrieve data and, you know what?, I was beeing chosen even if I genuinely told the co-founder of the company that I just used Python to run some exercise using pandas and numpy but, since I had never had a true reason to use it, I've never got myself involved in deeper learning. 

In that case he was happy cause could see a person that had other experiences but was also open to learn more and more. 

Then, also, to surprise them! 

For the same company I had to attend 4 interviews and, in one, I was asked too whether I could use an aumation tool that could (can't remember which one) and I tested it in the 2 previous days. So, I had no relevance of such info on my CV, but when I had the interview I said...""I've never worked with such tool, but I tested a couple of times and could create a dashboard and send it to emails given some rules.."". 

So, maybe you can't now, today, but this doesn't mean you can't learn it! :)"
F5v2dRYU5IA,Great video Alex! I especially liked the shout out to the BA with the good people skills 😎
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Please tell me anyone ""deploy"" Meaning in Telugu?"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hey, would you do any PSQL courses or projects? I'd love that"
F5v2dRYU5IA,I literally watched this yesterday and today I passed the first level of interview at a TOP FAANG company. Thanks Alex.
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thanks Alex.This is Madhusmita.I am learning MYSQL from your channel as well. I don't have any experience.I just done google data analytics course.How can I get an analyst job in USA.
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hey Alex, I’m 19 and finish your boot camp I’m pretty close finishing my portfolio, but do you think I can get hire considering my age ? Thanks for the boot camp ❤"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hi Alex,  I blew a SQL technical interview recently not because I don't know SQL but because I was really nervous and unprepared.  After looking at the questions calmly after the interview I realized they really weren't that difficult.   Do you think companies keep that on your ""permanent record"" meaning it might affect other jobs I might apply for within that company?  What's your experience?"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"With my last two healthcare analyst remote interviews for two different healthcare systems, I actually worked directly with the hiring manager and never spoke with a recruiter. 
1.  First one started with email from the manager followed by a 30 minute phone call with the manager followed by a proctored SAS-SQL technical test on paper/panel interview that lasted 2 hours the following week. 
2.  The second one also started with an email from the manager followed by a proctored SQL technical on paper.  From there,  if I passed I was invited to a formal interview with hiring manager and director.  From there a panel interview from the team the following week."
F5v2dRYU5IA,"HI, Alex Sir this master class is best for Data science students more  informaction about interviews and course topics in deep .
Thanks,UP"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Hello Alex, how to join your live"
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Thank you Alex, you make every minute worthy."
F5v2dRYU5IA,"I've been a regular viewer of the channel since 2022. I wanted to share with you today: Thank you, I got accepted for an internship in DA! It's a happy moment for a humanities graduate like me. Next, I plan to focus on pursuing a Master's in Statistics. Thank you very much for your selfless sharing, which has kept me learning even in lonely times."
F5v2dRYU5IA,"1 hour in and got to know a lot of things. Thanks Alex, its incredibly helpful since I have an interview tomorrow :)"
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thanks for all you do. Looking forward to the AWS and Azure tutorials on Analyst Builder.
F5v2dRYU5IA,"No freaking way people have data analyst jobs and tell interviewers they have 3+ year in SQL but cant do simple joins and aggregation. This guy probably has a job as a data analyst too. Why the hell is it so hard for me to get a interview?! Oh wait, it's because I have no work experience, and my portfolio is not even glanced over. Great

P.S. I later found out Alex said he lied his ass off >_<"
F5v2dRYU5IA,Don't wear suit becuase now you belong to technical industry not non-technical 😉
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thank you for this! Preparing for my first ever interview on Friday!!
F5v2dRYU5IA,lol I have an interview TODAY thank you 🙏
F5v2dRYU5IA,"What a coincidence that this drops before my round 2 interview tomorrow and another interview (1st round) Thursday. Now that's what's up, guys."
F5v2dRYU5IA,Hello from Turkey
F5v2dRYU5IA,"Watched this while knocking out some SQL practice, thanks for the insight and giving hope! 🤙🏽🫡"
F5v2dRYU5IA,feels like interview with Hitman
F5v2dRYU5IA,Thank you!
_R6K1aNtKpE,HI is there any PROMOCODE for courses on Analyst Builder ?
_R6K1aNtKpE,"So cool to see the behind the scenes here.  Alex, I've used your website and it is DOPE!  Congrats to both of you, all the best."
_R6K1aNtKpE,Hey!  Part 2!  Reminiscing the Beta launch while watching this.  That was a fun time. 😁
_R6K1aNtKpE,Hey Alex I am aarush I am a 11th commerce student and am planning to take the analyst builder course the thing I want to know is do u plan to update or add new courses

5tKmTdvEAVk,Give us some BTS
5tKmTdvEAVk,Congrats Alex! Is he your cofounder?
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Hi Alex or everyone reading this comment, im considering taking the lifetime access bundle in analyst builder. But before that, im also considering a google data analytics professional certification. Do you think i should take the google first or just go straight into analyst builder??"
5tKmTdvEAVk,Been waiting for this
5tKmTdvEAVk,Analyst builder is a nice tool but it’s way too similar to stratascratch.
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Hi Alex,you are doing great job ...can you please make vedio on ATS resume for data analysts for 2024..it would be really helpful"
5tKmTdvEAVk,Hi can you provide SQL notes plz
5tKmTdvEAVk,It’s hypocritical using AI in this software and you keep saying AI won’t takeover job
5tKmTdvEAVk,"I came across a challenge on ur excel formula lessons,=if(d2:d10>30, ""old"", ""young""), only D2 would input the formula not the entire sellected column d2:d10. please help me on how to correct this. Kindly assist"
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Hello Alex,

I've started learning data analytics by watching your videos. Heartful thanks for your efforts ❤

I have a doubt that can I become a data analyst without having a college degree although having enough skill sets ? 

Awaiting for your reply"
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Great Talks and project ideas, many thanks. keep up"
5tKmTdvEAVk,Congratulations kasun n the team
5tKmTdvEAVk,Great..... kasun bro.
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Alex, I couldn't agree more with you on installing the SQL Server, it was a pain in a**.
To think of it, I almost gave up on my data journey.
Am glad I didn't. 
Thank you."
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Nice work, Kasun and the team ❤️"
5tKmTdvEAVk,"I finally subscribed for the ""Very Hard"" questions,  been putting it off for a while now.  Let's see how it goes.  😀"
5tKmTdvEAVk,"Hi sir, I need your advice. So generally I'm using jupyter notebook for data analysis and ml as well. But I didnt work with pycharm or for example vscode. What can you sayabout this topic what is your advice? I have to practise with non-jupyter enviroments? Thanks for your attention beforehand. Btw you can make the video about that as well. I think it'll be useful."
5tKmTdvEAVk,❤🎉
5tKmTdvEAVk,Congratulations kasun aiya❤
5tKmTdvEAVk,"I will say that Analyst Builder is addicting, in a very good way!"
5tKmTdvEAVk,Oh wow! Seeing you both here made my day 😊 Sandy
5tKmTdvEAVk,Please come up with power bi series
5tKmTdvEAVk,Happy to see a Sri Lankan helps in building great stuffs.
5tKmTdvEAVk,Keep the interesting videos coming 🙏
5tKmTdvEAVk,Enjoying this!
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Got the same table from the same website but the ""percentage_laid_off"" column is not in 1 and 0's but rather in percentages like 85%, 95%, 100% and so on"
QYd-RtK58VQ,I love it
QYd-RtK58VQ,"This was  a roller coaster, the whole functions teachings and the project on sql, thank you ALex. I hope the time i've put in was worth it . Cant wait to come back and say I used this at my job  !"
QYd-RtK58VQ,You know the guy is too good because he makes them lessons very easy to follow and understand. Thanks man
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I really learnt a lot, it's been great listening and learning right from the beginning to this point... Kudos to me... Thanks Alex"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I think there might be an error in the exploratory data analysis section.
I ran into issues with total_laid_off, funds_raised_millions, and percentage_laid_off being treated as TEXT instead of numeric types.
I converted total_laid_off and funds_raised_millions to the proper data type (INTEGER). That was probably my mistake during data import.
However, in the tutorial, Alex uses percentage_laid_off as TEXT in aggregate functions. It worked by coincidence, because values like ""1"", ""0.9"", ""0.75"", ""0.5"", etc., maintain the same order both alphabetically and numerically.
Still, I believe best practice is to store all numeric values as numeric types — especially when using SQL, where INTEGER (or FLOAT for decimals) should be used instead of TEXT."
QYd-RtK58VQ,Done 🎉
QYd-RtK58VQ,We need more projects like this. Would love to see some real world projects that would be dealt with at a job. Something in supply chain or logistics would be great. Optimizing inventory or on time delivery analysis. This is something I am finding hard to locate a guided project on. Thanks
QYd-RtK58VQ,I definitely don’t have the same results that he has most of the things are the same but I don’t have quibi in my dataset I guess because my Null values were actually text and I deleted those from the percentage laid off column based off the logic of I don’t have the company size or total number of employees I can’t move forward so I removed them
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thank you Sir
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi Alex, Thank you! I have listened and followed along your first 19 courses. Excellent job! 

I am having a little but of a hard time downloading Git, then connecting with GitHub. Then there is VSC, then extensions,.... anyway, spent the entire day installing all that with not much success. I am hoping you would do a class and show us how to download all that and upload projects into GitHub. Thanks in advance and thanks for all you do. I very much appreciate your courses."
QYd-RtK58VQ,16:24 (for tomorrow)
QYd-RtK58VQ,"This is phenomenal, thank you! Not a lot of analyst showcase their thought process, very insightful!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,It is very good project but let me suggest you something if you added the context as comment it will sound nice or good
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Thank you Alex you don't know how happy I am I completed SQL series I am happily jumping on excel.
Do you all start creating your portfolio website now or do you wait till you finish the entire series? I am a little bit confused on whether to create a portfolio on the SQL I just concluded or finish the entire series before creating"
QYd-RtK58VQ,It was a lot for beginners but worth it.
QYd-RtK58VQ,GREAT !!
QYd-RtK58VQ,tahnk you so much sir
QYd-RtK58VQ,thank you alex !! appreciate it !! learnt a lot !!
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thank you very much Alex! This project is fun! 
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thank for everything
QYd-RtK58VQ,This is like the original seananners minecraft videos but with SQL 😆
QYd-RtK58VQ,"something i miss here is i don't see what is the prepose  or depending on what i will explore the data, should i have some questions about the data from the company so i work depending on there requirements?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thank you Alex ;)
QYd-RtK58VQ,"As I follow the video when Alex speaks of 'laid offs' and shows the numbers, on my end they seem to double the amount I see on the video. I have been following the videos step by step and am not sure how I numbers are larger than what is presented on video. Other than that everything looks just like Alex's video."
QYd-RtK58VQ,Is this rolling total the same as cumulative total
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Thank you so much for this❤ , off to creating my own portfolio"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Such a great teacher! and what a generosity! I just love you :) thank you so so much, dear Alex"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I have a question, all these projects that you make with MySQL, PowerBI, etc. Can we add them to our portofolio projects as work we have done? Or is that not correct to do, and the meaning with these project videos is just to show us how projects can be done?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"How do we present these findings in the EDA?
How do we showcase them? Do we just visit our mysql to show people again?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,Which video are we to watch to creare the portfolio
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I just finished the last video in the SQL series and am now jumping into the Excel series. Thank you so much for this. I learned a lot, and I will continue to learn more from your next videos. I just wanted to give my thanks and say that your videos are super helpful and easy to understand. Please don't stop making videos like these!!!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"For the rolling sum at 19:07, just a suggestion. We could probably use this query

SELECT 
    DISTINCT SUBSTRING(date,1,7) as Month, 
    SUM(total_laid_off) OVER(ORDER BY SUBSTRING(date, 1,7)) as layoffs_rolling,
    SUM(total_laid_off) OVER(PARTITION BY SUBSTRING(date, 1,7)) as total_layoffs
FROM 
    layoffs_staging2
WHERE 
     SUBSTRING(date,1,7) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1"
QYd-RtK58VQ,completed sql series of data analyst bootcamp
QYd-RtK58VQ,thank you so much Alex.. i know i will still have to do some more project myself
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Is it normal that whilst following along, everything works correctly but I get different Numbers? For example; my total_laid_off in the USA results are 1026236 where as in the vídeo ( 8:27 ) shows 256559. Basically I have much more of everything :) 

Awesome tutorials thanks a lot!!!!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,sir i heard myth data analysis take over AI is it correct ?
QYd-RtK58VQ,"7:49 How to get updated data on the layoffs, to check the affect of AI on the industries ?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hello Alex! Thank you so much for your effort making all this free courses. But there's something I still don't understand, it is when or what condition you should make another CTE? Like on last section about Company Year Ranking, is the CTE really needed there? Because I still don't understand the condition to put more CTE over CTE hahaha. Thankyou so much!!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I've just finished this tutorial about sql. As i said in the last videosn i've only one problem and it is not about Alex or the course but just about me cauz i'm a french guy so i learn all of these courses  with substitles so it's so long but at the end i'm so proud and i want tot give a big thanks to ALEX. . Next stop --> excel.
Ps: i write  this comment  without translator ^^^^"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"This gave me a different result.... SELECT YEAR ('date'), Sum(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY YEAR('date')
ORDER BY 1 DESC;"
QYd-RtK58VQ,exactly what I was looking for thank you SO SO MUCH
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Just finished the Data Cleaning project, using MS SQL Server Studio Management. Was definitely some interesting hurdles to work past and really gave me some deeper understanding of MS SQL Server syntax. Forced me to learn deeper into the MS SQL program and its capabilities. The vids so far have been a good guide, that still allowed me lots of room to have to troubleshoot and come up with ideas on my own to combat the slight differences in programs. But super rewarding! Keen to get into the EDA!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi 
Please how can I import the downloaded file from GitHub to MySQL?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"need to add how to export data, like specifics table to anywhere else for visualisation"
QYd-RtK58VQ,I thought I would add previous project and this one to github and linkedin. Should I add them two projects or add as the single project ?
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi Alex I've been through the SQL portion of this ""Boot Camp"", I've written my own query but for the life of me  I cant get it to round the values. I've tried ROUND in various places, writing it as a WITH but just dosen't seem to work for me. I've written the code below any help would be great. Also apologies if this is in completely the wrong place.

SELECT company, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, total_laid_off * (1 / percentage_laid_off) AS total_employees, `date`
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NOT NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NOT NULL

QYd-RtK58VQ,"thanks alex, great video as always! I've been wondering, could you or anyone else give me question to continue to work on this data ! I would love to try it to solve myself a solution to this data."
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Can anyone tell me how to include this project in resume, I mean what to write in those 3-4 bulletin points.?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Awesome information Alex! thank you for sharing. Question, should the query be named running total and not rolling total at 18:37?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Alex, what is the reason for you to always use backticks (`) when selecting/updating anything related to date? I'm sure you mentioned this before but I can't remember anymore."
QYd-RtK58VQ,A big thank you Alex. ♥
QYd-RtK58VQ,thank you

QYd-RtK58VQ,"20/74
Lets go!!!!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I would kindly like to give some feedback. In this video there was not much emphasis given to the ""precentage_laid_off"". However, I find this to be statistically important data. This is a proportion and gives a probability. For example, if you were to query ""SELECT stage, ROUND(AVG(percentage_laid_off),2)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY stage
ORDER BY 2 DESC;"" you would find the proportion of layoffs per company as opposed to just finding the companies that got rid of the most people. The argument here is that a large company with a layoff proportion of 0.05 could still show more people being laid off, then a smaller company with a layoff proportion of 0.7, even though this gives valuable insight that the past 3 years have hit small companies very hard. Thought I would mention this and open it up to any discussion."
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thanks Alex
QYd-RtK58VQ,"THANK YOU MR ALEX, YOU ARE A BLESSING"

Did anyone experience this?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I feel addiction towards learning because of your videos
You are adorable 👏
Thanks a ton❤"
QYd-RtK58VQ,Excellent Project ! I Learned a lot from this project ! Thank you Alex .
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thank you it was helpful
QYd-RtK58VQ,You are am amazing teacher thank you I am having such a fun time
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hey Alex, I would like to ask, do you think this SQL project (data cleaning and EDA) is suitable to put in resume? I hope you can answer this, thanks!"
QYd-RtK58VQ,Thank you!
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Amazing session, I have personally learnt a lot."
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi Alex, would please make the extension of this video how upload SQL queries in Power BI and make visualize the data in Power BI. It will be very helpful to know how we important SQL queries in Power BI and use it for Data visualization. In other words how would we use this project in Power Bi for visualization."
QYd-RtK58VQ,Really Amazing videos
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hello Alex, should we add the laid off mysql project to our portfolio or should we create our own?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,Alex you are impressive! the way you teach the data analytics is unbelievable & outstanding!
QYd-RtK58VQ,Will it be good to use this project in my  resume
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I think you can use ROUND(CAST(SUM(percentage_laid_off) AS DECIMAL(10, 2) *100, 2) on industry, because if you see that, consumer is the largest contributor if only see in the SUM but if you look in percentage FInances is the big contributor"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"hi Alex , if we practice this course and make portfolio so should we expect above avg paying or below average paying data analyst job"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"tried it this way and it worked

```
select * from layoffs_staging2 where
total_laid_off = 'NULL' 
AND 
percentage_laid_off = 'NULL';

delete 
from layoffs_staging2 
where
total_laid_off = 'NULL'
AND 
percentage_laid_off = 'NULL';
```"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"```
select *   
from layoffs_staging2 
where total_laid_off IS NULL
and percentage_laid_off IS NULL;
```

this query returned nothing from the project video.

Hence this query,  returns null

```select MAX(total_laid_off) , MAX(percentage_laid_off) 
from layoffs_staging2 ; ```

can anyone help ?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"thank you so much, this last query was challenging, but you are such a good teacher, thank you again"
QYd-RtK58VQ,That last query.. PHEWWW
QYd-RtK58VQ,In date column can we replace the null as unknow date
QYd-RtK58VQ,"everything went perfectly, however i could not alter the date, even though i saw the previous data cleaning video, i checked all the settings still date not updating"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hey Alex 👋 is it okay if I can skip excel to tableau, if I can’t afford it?"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"A big Thank Alex from Sudan .
I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the incredible content you create on your YouTube channel. Your videos have been a source of inspiration, education, and entertainment for me, and I truly appreciate the effort you put into each one"
QYd-RtK58VQ,Hi Alex! Thanks for all this material. Does SQL have any visualization interface?
QYd-RtK58VQ,I attempted to do the Rolling_total using a window function but it doesn't seem to work. Is there any benefit to using CTE vs. window function?

QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi @AlexTheAnalyst, truly appreciate your work 
is it a good idea to combine this and data cleaning project and show it as a single project in portfolio?
awaiting your reply 
thanks"
QYd-RtK58VQ,really great man! because of you i  just started enjoying the data analysis
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi Alex! As someone already said, a follow-through on Tableau would be amazing! Also how, based on this, how to import it to Tableau (and how to choose between the queries etc..)! Thx, great work"
QYd-RtK58VQ,I'm getting exactly the double of the values as Alex gets.  What will be the reason?
QYd-RtK58VQ,Hey alex bro u r great
QYd-RtK58VQ,Awesome video. Next up is visualizing the data 🙌
QYd-RtK58VQ,thank you Alex so much for the tutorial.
QYd-RtK58VQ,"I need someone to explain to me what exploratory data analysis means🙇🏽‍♀️
When writing a project I find it difficult to know what to write in the exploratory data analysis section.🙏🙏"
QYd-RtK58VQ,can we use this in our portfolio or is there another way of creating one ourself
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Since this is an extension of the previous video, would you consider making a tableau video based on this data? Thank you so much for everything that you do! ♥"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hello Alex, great video, I've learnt alot from you in the past year. The problem i experience with CTEs is they dont seem to be recognized by my ssms, what seems to be the issue"
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Great content! I am hooked with this series. Hey Alex, you can calculate the Total Employees, total_laid_off divided by percentage_laid_off. Keep the good content."
QYd-RtK58VQ,Very helpful with the rolling total way of doing it. It was a bit more complicated my way. Thanks
QYd-RtK58VQ,I want to learn Business analytics and data analytics . Please i need contact on hands on training.
QYd-RtK58VQ,"Hi Alex, Thank you for the video. Each time I try using the table Import Wizard, only about 500 rows of the data are imported. I have tried this multiple times with no difference. Please how can I resolve this?"

4UltKCnnnTA,"Around 42:00, where he had trouble with blanks and NULLS, I solved the problem by, instead of his where clause:

WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL

I have:

WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
AND (t2.industry IS NOT NULL AND t2.industry != '')

Which removed the entries from t2 where industry is blank. I only get 4 columns in the SELECT version of the statement, and I ended with no blank Airbnb entry after running the UPDATE statement."
4UltKCnnnTA,14:47 i can't create the table how you do these?
4UltKCnnnTA,"Thank you for the help but there's no way to download dataset to practice .
Do we have to pay or something?"
4UltKCnnnTA,"Anyone else constantly encountering errors while tying to follow along? I'm 42:47 in, and every single step I've had to update the data with complex queries just to be able to follow along, especially when updating NULL values. 
From the start, my csv was only uploading approx 560 rows out of the 2300-> solved this by converting to a JSON file.
Since then it's been fix after fix."
4UltKCnnnTA,"Fantastic video 
But why will I have to go through all these trouble in Sql when I can do it easily in Excel or Powerbi"
4UltKCnnnTA,Thank you!

4UltKCnnnTA,Discover new things and try new things. Thank you for this video. 😊
4UltKCnnnTA,"For removing duplicates using this same dataset in PostgresSQL using the date as a string (‘date’) in the partition by returned 21 rows.

Date was treated as a string and not a column name. Using date as date worked just fine on PostgreSQL. 

Don’t know how it’s done in MySQL."
4UltKCnnnTA,"Thanks, Alex, for this great video. I had a problem when filtering total_laid_off with NULL values, it did not work with me when I wrote 
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL, it worked when I wrote it WHERE total_laid_off =  'NULL'.. can I know why?"
4UltKCnnnTA,Just finished this great video. Looking forward to the next chapters.
4UltKCnnnTA,"Apparently, the country names having odd characters in them is a localization issue with mysql (and more probably my whole PC) not recognizing letters with specific accents or umlauts. Searching the exact row data as written shows fully normal search results, so assuming somewhere google translates that paragraph symbol in Malmo back to an o-umlaut behind the scenes automatically. Fun little thing to learn while learning SQL. I went and standardized them into something common since there were entries without the accent but correct letter, but was still cool to see the result of a missing language localization."
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hello Alex, thank you for this bootcamp. I am stuck at this query below as it keeps returning multiples. I am not sure what the issue is. I have tried to ORDER BY and use DISTINCT but its not working. Could i please get some guidance. Thank you

4UltKCnnnTA,In the Populating  part what if the instead of populating with the industry in the null row it replaces t1.industry with the industry name with null values ? how to tackle this
4UltKCnnnTA,"Lesson#19 Conclusion

What is Data Cleaning ? How data is cleaned step by step in MY SQL?
Step 1: Remove duplicates
Step 2: Standardizing the data 
Step 3: Remove Nulls/Blank values or populate with accurate data if possible
Step 4: Remove unnecessary columns/rows"
4UltKCnnnTA,As this is very first project that will be added to our portfolio can you please guide us how to built portfolio like how to add this project and which platforms are recommended so it would be very handy for us to keep moving and building projects step by step as we move forward
4UltKCnnnTA,Finally got hands on real life work and gained valueable skill of Data Cleaning as a data analyst
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hey Alex, thank you for your efforts! I appreciate it.
‏‪41:39‬‏ You could just edit the the Where conditions to be

Any solution???"
4UltKCnnnTA,"why i need to use 

SELECT *

for it to work

i research and basically it says i need to refer to Schema ---> Table (world_layoff.world_layoffs) , not just Schema (world_layoff)

how do i fix this?"
4UltKCnnnTA,"Thank you so much Sir.
I want some more videos on Advance SQL projects."
4UltKCnnnTA,Where was the data set actually obtained from?
4UltKCnnnTA,"Alex, thanks for the tutorial, you really did alot but please i cant download the layoff dataset"
4UltKCnnnTA,when deduplication....is it always best to do for all columns or sometimes just with user preferences!!
4UltKCnnnTA,Definitely had fun working on this project got confused some times but then I had help with ChatGPT definitely a good way to help explain the things you don’t understand
4UltKCnnnTA,"There is no better data analysis start for beginners than this and I am not exaggerating. The way you take us through each step, amend every mistake make it more enticing. I must say you have a data analysis gene in your DNA!

4UltKCnnnTA,35:36 when I run the industry for null and blank it return answer repeatedly for 3 times
4UltKCnnnTA,Thank you for this.
4UltKCnnnTA,from where i can get that excel sheet for layoffs
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hi Alex, I am enjoying your course, Data Analyst Bootcamp. Could you share the 'World_Layoffs' dataset used in tutorial 18? I want to follow the exercises. Thanks!"
4UltKCnnnTA,in what form can i put this in my portfolio ?
4UltKCnnnTA,super fun course. very educative👍👍
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hi guys, I am encountering a problem ar 42:33 where I'm trying to update all blanks to NULL. I followed the code as is on multiple occasions but 0 rows are affected and nothing changes. I still get a lot of blanks after that. I tried following the code on github but its not helping much. did anybody else encounter this?"
4UltKCnnnTA,"Would have already failed at removing the duplicates, I would just have grouped the entire table by all columns, so that only duplicates would ""fuse"" together, leaving only distinct rows behind."

4UltKCnnnTA,I’m happy to share with you guys I started my data analyst journey on May 4 and from then I don’t relent and don’t get tired I was able to cover Excel and MySQL class and I landed my first client on upwork for data cleaning and I’m moving forward with the class … wish me success guys moving to power Bi class
4UltKCnnnTA,"I've a doubt please help. In future we have more projects, then how to export data such that old doesn't show. Like here, we have parks table too. I tried making another connection but it didn't help."
4UltKCnnnTA,"Alex, hello! I really appreciate your tutorials—they help me understand data analysis more deeply. Thank you for your work!

I just wanted to point out that someone might encounter an issue when importing a CSV file due to the type of field separator. I couldn't run the SELECT * command until I changed the separator from a semicolon to a comma during import. But after that the import works well."

I’m having issues downloading the data set…..looks like it isn’t working anymore.😢"
4UltKCnnnTA,"Thank you alex...data cleaning is really changing for me, i think this project is more helpful to understand.."
4UltKCnnnTA,please how can i download the file on github. i click on download raw file but it's not downloading
4UltKCnnnTA,1:13 how can I import the raw data
4UltKCnnnTA,"I would really appreciate it if someone can explain to me why we are creating layoffs_staging and then layoffs_staging2. We can just add the row_num column to layoffs_staging by using the original table, right? Thanks in advance.
like this:
insert into layoff_staging
select *,
row_number() over(partition by company, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`) as row_num
from layoffs;

This will also not change the original table."
4UltKCnnnTA,Thank you so much
4UltKCnnnTA,"Finally I did it, I discovered the errors and corrected them,
thank you for working me through this lesson"
4UltKCnnnTA,"Guys, i could not find any duplicates. Is the dataset already cleaned on github?
I need this data set to practice these queires ? Can anyone help me out with this ?"
4UltKCnnnTA,Thanks!!!!
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hi everyone 
this  is an amazing project however, I have been facing a little challenge since I have been on the project and that has to do with the removing duplicates. I followed every code but instead of the duplicates to come out it still repeats the line of code where row_num > 1;  it is not filtering only the duplicates but everything that looks like the duplicate, please can someone help me troubleshoot this.

I got every other thing that includes standardizing the data, null values or blank values and removing columns."
4UltKCnnnTA,I just wanted to say thank you for the encouragement at the end. It was definitely a lot to take in. That extra little bit after everything was over was exactly what I needed to hear to keep going.

4UltKCnnnTA,"Thanks Alex, I just loved it!!"
4UltKCnnnTA,i was lost you are too fast all ofa sudden too much info
4UltKCnnnTA,We could have tried to find lay offs from other rows of the same company? Shouldn't we?
4UltKCnnnTA,"Has anyone noticed that since the beginning of the project, he has had the option  'limit to 1000 rows'? Meaning he's been working only with half of the data. Does this change anything?"
4UltKCnnnTA,Anyone with help on how to download the data file from GitHub....I'm having difficulty 😢
4UltKCnnnTA,thank you so much sir
4UltKCnnnTA,Im having an error in 14:25 . when i try to copy to clipboard and create statement. it shows me nothing.

was trying to use the case clause to grade marks but the outcome was not good since some come with null . actually my marks had points in the e.g. 72.4  so hw can i go about it  cud send the screen shot but have no option for that . thanks"
4UltKCnnnTA,"in really big data , you can't scan through any issue . What step should we take on?"
4UltKCnnnTA,"Spent hours doing this, some of the answers to the errors I had were on the comment section, thanks guys! Also chatgpt was a great help."
4UltKCnnnTA,I’m finding it hard to download the dataset from his GitHub page any ideas please
4UltKCnnnTA,Thank you so much for this data cleaning project I learned a lot.
4UltKCnnnTA,"Sir for populating or filling the blank values i did
select all from d table where d industry is null or blank ,copy d company name,select all again where d company is Airnb or whatever to find d value ure to fill then update ur table by set set d industry to d correct value where company is Airnb or whatever and industry is """""
4UltKCnnnTA,Hi guys I had an issue with the industry column wherein all the industry goes to CRYPTO
4UltKCnnnTA,I just followed the video. There was no problem when I imported the raw data.
4UltKCnnnTA,"32:30 My text format isn't getting converted to DATE format, tho im not getting any error too
Can anyone help?"
4UltKCnnnTA,Also I'm a bit mystified how would you put a thing like this on your portfolio.. just uploading the script file somewhere and link into it? Because this isn't really flashy presentation project like you might do with tableu or power bi showing the end result.. not to say that this isn't even more important skill to have but.. just seems hard to show off a thing like this.
4UltKCnnnTA,"Done and thanks! Educational, would need to do a similar project on my own data to really learn the stuff and it will be hard to write these advanced queries without the hand holding.. but that's how you learn."
4UltKCnnnTA,"Yes, this was quite challenging but super educating. Thanks a lot Alex!"
4UltKCnnnTA,"For anyone that is having trouble downloading the data  from github here is how to do it:
Select the link he provided that says Download Dataset under the video,
A tab should open up to github with a table and data
Above the table, there are tabs the says preview, code, blame etc. 
Go to the right side and select the third button with a download symbol next to a pencil (if you hover over it, it'll say download raw file)
It will appear in your download folder
Follow the steps he describe to import 
Once you click browse, select your download folder it should appear as an excel file. 

Good luck on your journey :)"
4UltKCnnnTA,Had issues downloading the ‘layoffs’ it was downloading in Excel format. How do I convert it to sql format ?
4UltKCnnnTA,thank youuuu sooooo much alex
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hi Alex, you have not explained this well. I am sorry to say but you went too fast and when we are inserting dataset in csv then it is only fetching 564 rows not all the rows so you did not explained the baackups that in certain situations what to do. This video not looked good."
4UltKCnnnTA,"Hi, Alex! I really enjoy your tutorials. When I was importing the raw data csv, only 564 records were added to the table. May I ask what could have happened here and how to fix it?"

Can you really be honest and tell me if I have a chance of being a data analyst? Why I have doubts is because there are so many freshers out there who will be preferred over me and also so many experienced professionals got laid off who will again be preferred over me with no CS degree. Though I would like to add is that if I am into something, I really excel in it. I am working for 20 years now and in every single job I have exceled and been promoted. I believe in myself."

BV5ckMNNvi4,This was very informative! Thanks for these tips! I am looking on how to apply them!
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green beans. I recently started my YouTube channel and I got my company registered, to train and mentor new guys in the field, help with career accelerators, and internship-like tasks and consulting. Thanks, Alex for all you do. I tell people with Alex's Bootcamp and Analyst Builder, that there is no need to build more courses, just their mindset is what I'm going to work on to confidently step out and take the jobs they deserve"

BV5ckMNNvi4,Thank you Alex for always support us with greatly courses. I really hopefully to create full course for AI with data analysis! ❤
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Alex please put more free content on Analyse Builder, I think it’s pretty easy for you to do and would help us a lot practicing SQL and Python. Thank you 😁"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans!!!!!
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans from Mexico City!
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green Beans!! I appreciate this video. I'm 6 months into giving up my business for a data analytics career change. I couldn't be happier with my decision, but I'm hungry for more. I'm hoping for a path into data engineering, but getting that next level gig is proving to be a challenge. Your honest videos give me hope that there's opportunity coming."
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans! Thanks Alex. This was very helpful
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans!!!! You're the best Alex keep doing what you do!!
BV5ckMNNvi4,green beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans!!!!
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans. Could you make videos on Azure as well? That would be super interesting
BV5ckMNNvi4,Thank you Alex. I am blessed
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green beans! I am also in healthcare. I was struggling thinking about how to move up from the position that I have been for the past year and a half, and your video came in right on time! 😊
Congratulations on Analyst Builder! I always recommend to everyone who wants to go into the field 👏🏼"
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Great to see your insights on being promoted. I've been in the Data Field for almost 3 years now and this has been my progression.

1. First Data Analyst Job. I got this a year after college. With covid happening in 2020, I wanted to try to sell SEO marketing and I failed horribly. Had a degree in Electrical Engineering which helped me land the first job, but also feels like it was a giant waste of time
2. After my first big project at the new job, I got a $100 a month raise.
3. Started working a ton with the executive team, and the company moved me from Marketing to Engineering for reporting. Recieved a 10k raise.
4. There was no room to grow (Told no use cases for python or Data Science in the company + no raises), looked for a new job. Landed a Job at a fintech (first 6 figure job) where I could grow into a Data Science role + use python
5. My Department got obliterated, boss left, every other data person went to different departments or left the company. Stayed in my role and learned as much as I could about Mode, DBT, Streamlit, Langchain so that I could build internal BI tools to optimize the teams procedures + reporting (which was almost nonexistant or incorrect)
6. Title change to Data Scientist (Still only data person in a full Risk/Underwriting Dept), and 3% raise (not happy about the raise part, especially taking on multiple peoples old work)

I didn't study new Data concepts at my first job, I thought I would be able to learn at the job which was a huge mistake in growth. When I started looking for my next job, I made a YouTube channel to force myself to study. I should also note, I was able to land my 2 jobs through networking as well. My Fintech job I got through a connection on my sports card YouTube channel. Really curious how connections will help on the data side of things. It's almost a year with this channel and have made over 100 vids, almost at 6k subs.

Anyways watched your vids when I was trying to land my first job, it was super helpful."
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans 😊
BV5ckMNNvi4,green beans!
BV5ckMNNvi4,The beans are indeed green
BV5ckMNNvi4,green beans!
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green beans 😁
Got my first DA job last year because of you. Now hoping to get my first promotion as well soon"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans!
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans 👏🏽
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green dance 😊or is it beans 😂
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans.
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Hi Alex, love your videos. Its so simple and methodical. Tells me exactly how to navigate!! Also, please accept my LinkedIn request!!☺"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,greenbeans
BV5ckMNNvi4,green beans =)
BV5ckMNNvi4,A man who values his wife... I am proud of you Alex. My wife and I are your followers. We are both data analyst and listening to this video together and she keeps smiling.
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans. I graduate with my Masters in Business Intelligence in May 2024. Looking forward to applying this knowledge as I been in my current position for six years as a Business intelligence analyst.  Happy to listen to some of your stories and I truly believe in Analsty builder.
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans!
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans!!
BV5ckMNNvi4,I'm happy to here my path so far is pretty similar with yours. Non-data position to a data-lite position because of the people who knew what I could do. Then a more data focused manager position now where I specified I wanted access to sql and tableau. I got that because I was able to communicate with the BI team thanks to videos like yours.
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green Beans. Thanks Alex, you’re awesome."
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans 🙌🏼
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,I loved this video! It’s very inspiring and I love that you mentioned the actual salaries because that gives me a realistic idea🙌🏼😁
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green beans Alex!! It's really fun to see this side of yours, and inspiring too. Looking forward to a similar path of self-reliance in the near future. Cheers!"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Probably worth noting that you can be doing every tip and not progressing. Sometimes you just are not at the right company! People who switch companies every 2 to 3 years do much better than those who stay at one organization. #GreenBeans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,"What a treasure trove of information. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us Alex. 
Three things that stuck out for me were:
1. Domain Knowledge (immense)
2. Networking and being visible
3. Constant Learning and improvement
4. Being valuable
Can't wait for what you will be sharing on the next episode, and please fill up your cup with water on the next episode...😉😊👍"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green beans.
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Green beans. Lol. Thanks for sharing, Alex. I've been thinking about getting a promotion a lot lately and what's next for me in my career, but just didn't know how to go about it. This is really helpful"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Love it
BV5ckMNNvi4,"Three different types of knowledge- explicit, implicit and tacit….

More importantly I think it’s the favor of God and applying yourself and being available by networking and being known as a problem solver who seeks opportunities that many people will run from.  Perception and perspective matter. Btw do you like veggie tales?  Green beans"
BV5ckMNNvi4,Relatable discussion.  I'm going through this journey myself.  I basically did a career change (military to civilian hospital) and now feel like I'm figuring out my new career path where I want it to go in the future.
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans
BV5ckMNNvi4,Thanks for the info.
BV5ckMNNvi4,"This is amazing Alex, i have quite a similar experience ( Almost ) and can relate to all of this. I am now on a Mid Level position now as a Business Intelligence Analyst and i am loving it."
BV5ckMNNvi4,Green Beans

QMUZ5HfWMRc,what's the difference between 'trigger' and just using regular 'insert into' queries for both the employee and salary tables
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"thank you for the lessons Alex!

question to anyone that has gone through the full bootcamp...

has anyone managed to land a data analyst job after this?"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"gonna review every part from before, before go into the project. Can't wait, sir. Thank you so much."
QMUZ5HfWMRc,YAY! I finished the SQL course!! Thank you Alex !!
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Can you create procedures to create update and delete events?

I.e. we want client app to call (on client side intervals) a procedure to check on the db side a query over all on the highest bidder and return who is highest more and more often as time draws nearer, after the auction ends, a final scan to confirm based on datetime who was most recent, and update a winner field."
QMUZ5HfWMRc,How do I get the datasets?
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hi Alex,
I hope you are doing well. I'm following your bootcamp as mentioned in the video doing the 'EVENT' section everthing done but 'EVENT' delete is not working I only do a simple thing just change the time 30 second to 10 second and it is working below is the updated code.

QMUZ5HfWMRc,Thank you
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Alex made learning so easy with the way he teaches, he made me come this far. Thank you Alex. I'm really Hoping I become an expert in D.A soon.

Anybody want to connect so that we can learn together?"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hey Alex, quick question, when do we have to use ""Lightning bolt without the ""I"" and the one WITH the ""I"" to run individual queries?"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hey Alex,

I wanted to thank you for this bootcamp. It's so kind of you to offer these treasures for free. You've made becoming a DA  even easier and less daunting. Thank you!"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,I have just finished the course series and am eager to get started on the upcoming projects!
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hi Alex! I love your videos, I've been watching them to review for my technical interviews! Do you think you could make a video going over date and time functions in MySQL? I'm having a hard time finding some good ones here on Youtube. Thanks for everything!"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Thank you very much!
QMUZ5HfWMRc,This is cool!

I'm so glad I came across this series 👍
Thanks Alex!"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Thanks
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Poor Jerry
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Thank you Alex! You're my SQL idol!
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Hello Mr. Freberg. I have a short question.first of all Thanks for your channel. I am following you from your freecodecamp video. I just find out that you teach other things in your freecodecamp course ( like here it is Mysql and there you use Microsoft sql . of course all they both uses sql but there are some differences as well) I just want to ask you which one of your courses do you recommend ?
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Great Work Alex.
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Thank You Alex, and sorry for Jerry Gergich"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"An amazing SQL course Alex, thank you so much! I heard about normalisation, primary and foreign keys and optimisation, would there be any way of creating a couple videos for these? Love the way you teach so if this is possible I would be truly thankful!"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hoping you can make a playlist for SQL Debugging (Exploring errors and how to fix that, I know there's a lot of error we may encounter but this is very helpful). Anyway thanks for the SQL topics, very insightful."
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"After unchecking ""Safe Updates"" and jerry gergich still doesn't get deleted, go to - Query --> Reconnect to Server . Now execute your query. (you might need to change your event name from ""DELETE RETIREES"" to something else if sql says ""event 'executed' already exists"". Hopefully, this helps"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,even after every check jerry gergich still exist in my employee demographics
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Just finished the series and I'm amazed on how you teach. I full understand every detail unlike other online courses.
QMUZ5HfWMRc,for some reason this was by far my favorite lesson. Thank you Alex!
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"I did all the recommendations but creation of event still doesn't work , anyone to help please?"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Thank you Alex
I will enjoy it here 🥰"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"if the ""event scheduler"" value is off, do we edit it on the table itself or is there a specific code to write to turn it on?"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"what's the code for ""before"" - to store the data somewhere BEFORE its deleted"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Thank you, Alex, I am very great full that I have learned a lot of things from Basic to Advanced level. you are Great"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,alex youre mean to older people
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Poor Jerry got deleted
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Events not working for me, tried troubleshooting the also"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,I am having a great time learning with your series for MySQL which I did not even learn in my Coursera course ! Everything is explained in a simple way to understand. I plan to finish the bootcamp and land up in job as data analyst. Thanks a lot for the great work and helping out so many people around the globe.
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"hi, where can I look at those 2 projects that you are mentioned in the video: Data Cleaning Project & Exploratory Data Analysis Project. Thanks Alex!!"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hi Alex, thanks for the great work. I am a beginner and these videos are beneficial."
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"You can actually drop a trigger in MySQL:
DROP TRIGGER employee_insert"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,AMAZING
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"GOD BLESS YOU, ALEX! <3 <3"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,thank you so much it was very helpful
QMUZ5HfWMRc,I am getting syntax errors and the error 'CREATE TRIGGER' must be the first statement in a query batch. I can't seem to find a solution. Does anyone know the cause of this error?

QMUZ5HfWMRc,Not working for me
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hey Alex, thank you so much for this series on Mysql. I really appricaite all the hard work you've put to bring us this amazing work. Your way of explaning topics is so easy. Thanks again."
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Thanks for this .
O little bit difficult 😊"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,not jerry again
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Enjoyed, poor Jerry finally getting a break"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,@Alex The Analyst how do you insert multiple row data in one go?
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hi, I did everything (troubleshooting), but jerry still doesn't get deleted. Can anyone explain that to me please?"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"very useful series, i finished the sql and excel so far. very excited for the projects"
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Damn you Ron Swanson!
QMUZ5HfWMRc,Thank you so much sempai🙏🔥💌
QMUZ5HfWMRc,"Hey Alex, thanks for this series on MySQL. The way you explain things is so dynamic and clear, you really do a great work! Also, your examples with The Office and Parks and Recs characters are simply fantastic. We have fun while learning and this is amazing. Thanks for all that !"
7b8ViCqD9JM,How do I start working with a recruiter
7b8ViCqD9JM,"For me, tools like smart applier really help my job apps to stand out and be visible to the recruiters"
7b8ViCqD9JM,"Hi Alex, do you know the website where i can find recruiter's email address for cold emailing? Thank you"
7b8ViCqD9JM,Hi dear Alex I hope your having great day ❤
7b8ViCqD9JM,How to find out recruiters
7b8ViCqD9JM,Honestly this strategy doesn't work anymore. Most recruiters are flooded with messages that now they choose to ignore you.
7b8ViCqD9JM,"DID THE RECRUITER KNOW U WERE A BEGINER WITHOUT EXPERIENCE??
This ain't that easy...😢😢"
7b8ViCqD9JM,Huh. That's quite extroverted approach. I already feel scared from the very idea of cold emailing. How did you deal with such stress?
7b8ViCqD9JM,Ace advice Alex! As always (5A's dang)
7b8ViCqD9JM,"I keep thinking I want to have this kind of job so I don’t have to interact too often with the public.
But then I watch videos trying to learn and I’m bored to death.
So I am not smart enough to pay attention to technical material.
But also not peoply enough to handle a social / customer service job. 
What gives.
Yes I’m just here to complain 😤
Sorry I’m frustrated."
7b8ViCqD9JM,Sir kindly made video on how to find recruiters that would be helpful
7b8ViCqD9JM,Same experience here!   And I think I'll need a recruiter to find a wife
7b8ViCqD9JM,"Hey Alex! Thanks for the guidance this definitely changes my approach. However, could you maybe also explain how to tell whether a recruiter is legit or not or what to watch for. Ex. A lot of recruiters have reached out through WhatsApp. I always feel suspicious lol"
7b8ViCqD9JM,Without python can i be a data analyst. Is python is important then which library should we learn.
7b8ViCqD9JM,hey Alex.. how can get in touch with recuriter? can you explaining it in another full video😊😊
7b8ViCqD9JM,How do I get in contact with a recruiter ?
7b8ViCqD9JM,Might be useful to explain how to find and get in touch with a recruiter and how that process works
7b8ViCqD9JM,But like how do I get in touch with them in the first place? That’s my question
7b8ViCqD9JM,Thanks a lot for your videos! How would you know which ones are legit though?
7b8ViCqD9JM,"I need to do this more, I've heard some jobs aren't actually advertised, and if anything you'll have less competition applying directly"
7b8ViCqD9JM,"Recruiters are great - but they really don't accomplish a ton until you get into more senior roles. The biggest advice for a job seeker - APPLY ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE. 

I landed so many more interviews by applying directly with employer than I ever did applying through LinkedIn or any other job board. My hit rate with corporate job boards was easily 50x higher than any third party job board. 

When you start applying for manager, or executive roles then you really need to have a recruiter working for you. Often the recruiters for management and higher roles have a connection to the hiring manager/ELT/Board and that will make all the difference. 

My last job change took me from a senior analyst role to a director/senior manager role because I had a good recruiter working with me."
7b8ViCqD9JM,What’s a recruiter
7b8ViCqD9JM,Thanks for this information. I am about starting the process of job search and you just saved me from impending frustration. Could you please recommend some recruiters?
7b8ViCqD9JM,Exactly what I do
7b8ViCqD9JM,"Heyy Alex, please do video on how to get freelancing projects for Data analyst role"
7b8ViCqD9JM,"Informative.

7vnxpcqmqNQ,"I am able to understand your bootcamp well, and I know that Stored Procedures are an important part of Advanced SQL. However, you haven’t explained the IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters in Stored Procedures. Could you please explain them?"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,Thank you sharing a storaged procedure knowledge understand me easy❤
7vnxpcqmqNQ,Done
7vnxpcqmqNQ,Wow! Thanks Alex! So simple and easy to understand.
7vnxpcqmqNQ,The type checking is clean ☺️
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"This was a tough one gotta review, thank you ALEX !!!"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"Lession#17 Conclusion
1. What are stored procedures in my SQL how they work?
2. How to create & call a stored procedure?
3. How we can create a stored procedure automatically?
4.How we can add multiple queries in a single stored procedure?
5.What is a Delimiter and Parameter in a stored percedure and whats their functionalities?"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,What are the differences between functions and procedures in MySQL. I checked out to understand the differences without finding a clear explanation
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"While going through the stored procedures specially delimiter part there are some questions which raise kindly answer so the concept gets crystal clear.

Q1 : Can we use delimiter outside the stored procedures instead of semi colon ?
Q2 : Once the delimiter is changed from semi colon ; to anything else than what is the role of ; semi colon in the code 

As in the above code both the $$ and ; are being used then what is the purpose or role of ; in a query"

7vnxpcqmqNQ,Thanks for teaching us ❤
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"Hi i am confuse here
What is difference between views,store procedure both are doing the same thing..."
7vnxpcqmqNQ,The company doesn't care about Tom and Jerry when the salaries are increased but it also doesn't hesitate to see them as highly paid employees...
7vnxpcqmqNQ,6:25 This is not giving two outputs for me as only the second query in the stored procedure is running.
7vnxpcqmqNQ,I have a question regarding parameters. I don't think I quite understand them well but in what scenario would they be useful? I understand why stored procedures are useful but the whole parameter thing kind of lost me.
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"I hate myself...  I had a really TLDR comment going and managed to lose my work!  Not the course's fault, I own the responsibility. Anyway, I learned some ""USE"" syntax from this lesson that explained a minor issue I encountered earlier tonight.  Trial and Error, not the most efficient learning method, but - it's better than not learning at all!  Great lesson for so many reason Alex, thanks again for your time and effort.  Cheers!  BB 😎"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,This was awesome and so clear. It felt so understandable. Thanks for this tutorial.
7vnxpcqmqNQ,did exec turn to call? i'm revising and before i wrote it that way.
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"This is extremely helpful. You explain things very nicely, Alex. Keep it up! :)"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,This whole series is AWESOME!!
7vnxpcqmqNQ,The best STORED PROCEDURE video I have seen on Youtube. Kudos to you ALEX.
7vnxpcqmqNQ,why should one use procedures instead of views?
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"I am so thankful that I discover your chanell way back Feb 2023 Alex.  Before that , I am so lost in my career not knowing my purpose in life. But bc of some random vid yt recommended to me , I become interested in D.A field and your yt channel is such a great help. You've become my role model like a father figure teaching his son to be successful . I am currently working as a  customer service rep. and currently taking the Google D.A cert to increase my chance in entering in DA industry."
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"Wow ❤ amazing, those stored procedures is like creating functions in Kotlin or java, python, etc.

I’d happy if you could make a video about backup in postgresql"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"Did you see gen Ai analytics from pyramid analytics , what do you think about it Alex?
https://youtu.be/UDQ0fyGz7t4?si=9VM_jgbIbr9ouCBu"
7vnxpcqmqNQ,Could this be applicable with date params? I have complex queries that I run often enough that this could be useful but I do have to shift the 'Where date Between yyymmdd and yyyymmdd'
7vnxpcqmqNQ,"Hi. Do a video on uncorrelated subqueries
i.e
SELECT s1.article, dealer, s1.price
FROM shop s1

There is an SQL query that I can write to get all active temporary tables that I have now ? 
thanks a lot"

uEk07jXdKOo,Thank you Alex!
uEk07jXdKOo,Damn even the employee names are character's names from the show 😂
uEk07jXdKOo,✅
uEk07jXdKOo,You’re not “wrong” but temp tables copy the table data exactly onto another location on the disc. CTEs were created to avoid this weakness. Temp tables have to be deleted after use or they leave themselves as consumed memory on the disc and dramatically increase I/O time.
uEk07jXdKOo,is there a lesson for table creation? cant find it
uEk07jXdKOo,Done very straight forward
uEk07jXdKOo,can we go where noone else goes? can I know what noone else knows?
uEk07jXdKOo,"Hi Alex, in 2:00 i got this Error Code: 1050. Table 'temp_table' already exists response. idk why because i haven't this table before! I just change name like tempt_table then it works as yours, but i wan't to learn why i get this error?"
uEk07jXdKOo,is it different from VIEWS ?
uEk07jXdKOo,"Guys, I think Alex likes Lord of the Rings."
uEk07jXdKOo,"Hlo i have created the first temp table and my name last name and movie is showing 4 times in the table
Can you tell me what is the reason for that"
uEk07jXdKOo,"I've always appreciated Alex the Analyst, but after i watched this video and realized his favourite movie is Lord of The Rings, he has earned much more of my respect. Lol."
uEk07jXdKOo,"hello! I did the same exercise but in the end it gave me an error: "" Table 'parks_and_recreation.temp_table' doesn't exist"" .
How to know what the error is if I did the same?"
uEk07jXdKOo,"Hi @Alex, I am getting ""Error Code: 1046. No database selected Select the default DB to be used by double-clicking its name in the SCHEMAS list in the sidebar."" when I am trying to create temp table in mysql. can you pls help me."
uEk07jXdKOo,@Alex thanks for supporting LOTR The Two Towers! It's also my favourite part and for some reasons it's so underrated
uEk07jXdKOo,"I have noticed that so far you don't really structure the SQL database into folders and files, are there any general folder structures for an SQL project for data analysis, or when you actually work as a data analyst how would you structure your SQL project?"
uEk07jXdKOo,my output shows same value 3 times. why
uEk07jXdKOo,GOLUM GOLUM GOLUM
uEk07jXdKOo,Great thanks alot
uEk07jXdKOo,Lord of the Rings is definitely Alex's favourite film trilogy.
uEk07jXdKOo,"hello guys why I'm always have this error msg for temporary table	select * from temp_table LIMIT 0, 1000	Error Code: 1146. Table 'parks_and_recreation.temp_table' doesn't exist	0.000 sec"
uEk07jXdKOo,Alex my Mentor from afar. Great video as always!
uEk07jXdKOo,"Good Evening Alex, back at it again tonight.  Temp Tables in MySQL has been as instructive and as enjoyable as all of the other videos in the series.  Again, I'm really grateful (all ""thumbs up"" have been mashed throughout the course) to have all of this valuable knowledge in one spot.  Jim Kwik says ""Knowledge isn't power, it is potential power.  What we do with the knowledge is the power.""  Hoping to use your concepts at work to apply the power of your courses.  Thanks for all of your time and effort.  Cheers!  BB 😎"
uEk07jXdKOo,"hey , when you closed the session 
then you have to run  :- use database ;  command 
then only you can run other queries (although temp table response is  as same as u said) but you followed wrong way....
its always going to show error if you haven't selected (use database command)  after closing the session"
uEk07jXdKOo,You have good movie taste. Lord of the rings the two towers is def one of my fav movies all time. Thank you for the bootcamp!
uEk07jXdKOo,"Hey Alex, you said , assign the temp table in two types. Until the end, you do not reveal the second type..."
uEk07jXdKOo,"Loving the videos Alex, the LotR reference was great! 😂 cracked me up!"
uEk07jXdKOo,"Great Alex ! 

Do you have any videos on writing sql queries on databases in different servers ? 

Woukd love to see that"
uEk07jXdKOo,"Hey Guys! Learning from Alex's Bootcamp Playlist this past few days already and really enjoying it! Discussions are so connected, clear and easy to understand. You wont feel like your jumping into different infos (that thought of ""huh? what was that? Where did it came from?"" feeling. Lol). Not to mention that I don't have any experience of coding or using aggregate functions before :)"
uEk07jXdKOo,Hey Alex ! Can u make DIY Data Analyst Curriculum using Udemy for 2024(updated one)
uEk07jXdKOo,Very useful!

uEk07jXdKOo,"Sorry, when is your Tableau course release data?"
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Hey Alex , some table does not exist . Can you tell me how to fix it ?"
UC7uvOqcUTs,can i select and add first name and last name in this CTE query? if yes then please tell me how do I write this query?
UC7uvOqcUTs,"**Common Table Expressions (CTEs):  excellent for improving readability, maintainability, and reusability**

CTEs are temporary result sets defined within the execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement. This temporary result set is then available within the main SQL query. CTEs offer several advantages that make them an attractive option:

1. **Readability**: CTEs allow you to break down complex queries into more straightforward, more readable parts. Giving each part of the query a meaningful name can make the overall query structure more intuitive and easier to understand.
2. **Maintainability**: When using CTEs, changes to the query logic need only be made in one place, reducing the potential for errors. This is particularly useful when dealing with large, complex queries using the same logic in multiple places.
3. **Reusability**: A single CTE can be referenced multiple times within the same query. This eliminates the need to repeat the same subquery or temporary table, making your code more concise and efficient.
4. **Recursion**: CTEs support recursive queries, which help deal with hierarchical data structures, such as employee hierarchies or bills of materials. Recursive CTEs allow you to traverse these structures efficiently and elegantly.

**Temporary Tables:  offer better performance with large datasets.** 

Temporary tables are actual tables created within the database session that persist through that session. They offer some advantages over CTEs:

1. **Indexing**: Temporary tables can be indexed, significantly improving query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
2. **Persistence**: Temporary tables persist throughout the database session, allowing you to reuse them across multiple queries without redefining them.

However, temporary tables also have some drawbacks:

1. **Overhead**: Creating and dropping temporary tables adds overhead to your SQL script. You need to explicitly manage their lifecycle, which can make your code more complex.
2. **Maintenance**: If your script creates many temporary tables, keeping track of them and ensuring they are properly cleaned up can become challenging.

**Subqueries:  helpful for simple cases but can become less readable and performant as complexity grows.**

Subqueries are queries nested within another SQL query. They can achieve similar outcomes to CTEs but have some limitations:

1. **Readability**: When a query becomes complex or the same subquery is used multiple times, the code can become less readable and more challenging to maintain.
2. **Performance**: In some cases, subqueries may not be as performant as CTEs or temporary tables, especially when dealing with large datasets.

**Performance Considerations**

When choosing between CTEs, temporary tables, and subqueries, it's essential to consider the performance implications. CTEs are not stored as objects and do not have statistics like temporary tables, so they may only sometimes be the best choice for performance-critical operations, especially with large datasets. In these cases, using temporary tables with indexes might be more efficient.

However, the performance differences between these techniques can vary depending on the specific database management system and the nature of the query. It's always a good idea to test and benchmark your queries to determine which approach works best for your particular use case."
UC7uvOqcUTs,Loved this
UC7uvOqcUTs,Yhooooo 🥲
UC7uvOqcUTs,✅
UC7uvOqcUTs,pinga
UC7uvOqcUTs,Thankk youu Alexx
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Hey Alex! I have learned a lot about SQL so far by watching these videos. I have one question about this video in particular. What makes the second query easier to read than the first query? I understand that the CTE exists to handle more advanced calculations, but what makes the first query harder to read?"
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Now this is actually a start of advance level , I have to go through sub queries, window funtions, and CTES again and again to clear the concepts along with real data problems remeber we have to think through a raw data to create a logic to solve data problems using all these tools like group by , window funtion, sub queries ctes etc, Think and analyse which tools are best for certain conditions..

Thanks to alex for making things so easier to grab and learn making progress day by day and very hopefull to get a dream job as an analyst"
UC7uvOqcUTs,Do ctes completely replace subqueries?

UC7uvOqcUTs,"One of the useCase of CTEs.
When u wanna display a single column but ur select contains multiple columns
U can use CTEs like this

UC7uvOqcUTs,"Hi Alex, the beginner and intermediate courses were presented on MS SQL platform while with the advanced you've moved to MySQL, which is written slightly different. I managed to find how to perform CTE in MS SQL, but it was kind of confusing. Anyhow, wanted to thank you for your videos. You're a great teacher and the videos are extremely beneficial."
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Can you explain me I have 2 different results for the same table: CTE AVG(salary) result 55589, without CTE 56090, if we export  data to the spreadsheet it also shows AVG 56090."
UC7uvOqcUTs,Thank you.
UC7uvOqcUTs,Thanks you sir 👍
UC7uvOqcUTs,Alex what is the difference between VIEW function and this WITH CTE example stuff
UC7uvOqcUTs,This is the best way to go on tables. Thank you for this information
UC7uvOqcUTs,I have only experienced CTEs in Alex's YouTube lessons.  I believe I will learn more when I use CTEs out in the wild.  Reasonable pace with clear instructions.  I feel challenged in Alex's courses but NEVER stupid.  We all have to start somewhere and it's helpful to have someone showing me the way that has walked this path.  Much gratitude for your efforts Alex.  Cheers!  😎
UC7uvOqcUTs,"I have noticed that the result for avg salary for both female and male is different from the result obtained with windows functions, on the pervious video. Could anyone explain, please? which version is more accurate?"

please consider about it.............................................."
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Using ctes constantly at my work, a senior colleague thought me once, they are very helpful for huge data sets to compare with each other"
UC7uvOqcUTs,"May I ask in which real-world scenario would getting an average of averages without weighing by their relative counts make sense? I know this was just a didactic example, but I was still a bit puzzled by that considering the fact that an actual population average would have to consider how many people are contributing for each average: ((avg_salary * count_salary) WHERE gender = female) + ((avg_salary * count_salary) WHERE gender = male) / the sum of both counts. Thanks in advance!"
UC7uvOqcUTs,Hey Alex! Love the video on CTEs. I'm wondering if you'd consider making one on solving a gaps and islands problem? I've watched and read tutorials on them and the overview logic makes sense but I tend to get a bit lost when applying all the various window functions. Thanks!
UC7uvOqcUTs,"Great lesson and the next one on #Temp tables will be too.  Last week,  one first round interview question (non technical part of the interview series) I was asked was ""describe the difference between a CTE and a #Temp Table.""

1KEbiqRWOkA,"My question is do you sometimes have to be training any machine learning algorithms imported from Python libraries such Scikit-learn, Tensorflow,Pytorch and any other machine learning or deep learning libraries during your job as a data analyst or data analytics manager?"
1KEbiqRWOkA,"hi alex, can i ask why i cant import excel data to ssms? it said microsoft oledb not register on local machine and i cant open sql import & export. please help me"
1KEbiqRWOkA,from where we get to start on soft skilla?? any body knows??
1KEbiqRWOkA,"hi alex i just tried your analystbuilder and tried to solve the free and easy question about the tesla models and all my solution is wrong because i only know ssms so i turn the data into excel and imported it to ssms and this is my solution

Select tesla_model, car_price, cars_sold, production_cost, (car_price-production_cost)*cars_sold as Profits
From Tesla_Sales..Tesla_Model_Sales
Order By Profits Desc

Edit: I viewed the solution and the postgreSql is the closest one to my answer so right now ill do it in postgreSql and learn whats the difference between postgeSql and ssms

also I'm still getting it wrong 
this is my solution

Select tesla_model, car_price, cars_sold, production_cost, (car_price-production_cost)*cars_sold as Profit
From tesla_models
Order By Profit Desc
LIMIT 1;

and this is the write answer

SELECT tesla_model, car_price, cars_sold, production_cost,
  (car_price - production_cost) * cars_sold AS profit
FROM tesla_models
ORDER BY profit DESC
LIMIT 1;

Whats the difference I cant see the difference in here but its flagging my solution as wrong I only added the Limit 1;

Edit2: ok i saw the problem it took me 5 mins to notice Its because i capitalize the P in profit"

1KEbiqRWOkA,Sir please how do I use the CONCAT and LOWER function together
1KEbiqRWOkA,man i hate networking... uhhhhhhhhh
1KEbiqRWOkA,"I needed to see this video. I was in a bit of a slump after losing an opportunity to an internal hire,but im going to use everything I can to get my first analyst role this year."
1KEbiqRWOkA,"Hi Everyone, I kinda followed all of these for the past 4 months and I still haven't gotten any interviews. I have emailed many recruiters on Linkedin but they don't even send a reply. I also have a portfolio but I noticed on GitHub there is no traffic, meaning the recruiters are not even checking my portfolio. The saddest part i got laid off from my current job, but even with a computer science degree and BootCamp certificates, i still got no offers, this whole thing is starting to get depressing"
1KEbiqRWOkA,Hey Please make a video on data sources for personal projects
1KEbiqRWOkA,@ezdubs_bot
1KEbiqRWOkA,"I followed all of Alex's tips and got my first data job 4 months ago, fully remote paying $25 an hour.

Not much but I'm proud! I don't have a college degree at all, just hard work and proving to people that I can do the work. What really set me apart was my python skills, my employer knew this was a valuable skill and with this I was able to automate an entire week's worth of data entry in just 3 hours with Selenium. 

Alex is totally right when he says that projects and working with a recruiter is what will help you land that first data job. If it weren't for me creating projects and showcasing them during my interview and not working with a recruiter I would not have obtained this job. 

Those who are working towards a data job, don't give up and continuously improve your skills especially SQL and Python. Thanks Alex!"
1KEbiqRWOkA,How do you find good recruiters though?
1KEbiqRWOkA,"External recruiters cost your future employer to bring you on board. Your future employer's internal recruiters couldn't fill your future position and now they have to pay someone to find you. Just follow the money and you will see. I worked in Accounting, I saw how the dollars would flow for hiring engineers."
1KEbiqRWOkA,"Amazing,"
1KEbiqRWOkA,Can we do data analytics as a freelance career ...?
1KEbiqRWOkA,"Awesome tips Alex, thank you! Question for you, how important do you think having a cover letter is when applying? I’ve heard mixed things."
1KEbiqRWOkA,"I agree with everything you said, however i do believe you missed a very important subject in the interview process"
1KEbiqRWOkA,"I love your videos Alex, keep them coming, and analyst builder, I hight recommend it !!!, are you gonna be putting up a tutoral on tableau on AB? 🤞"
1KEbiqRWOkA,Great tips Alex mate! I am getting more and more involved in the world of AI and Data
1KEbiqRWOkA,🏃🏾‍♀️me running to this video. Thank you Alex!
1KEbiqRWOkA,Anyone doing Data analyst course
1KEbiqRWOkA,Thanks for the helpful and friendly video
1KEbiqRWOkA,"Please can somebody summarize this video, I'm happy for you though, or sorry that happened."

7NBt0V8ebGk,"I just want to share a small tip: after running a query, you can “Pin” the result tab.
I’ve been struggling in SQL to keep track of where things are — I have the short memory span of a goldfish — and pinning the results has really helped."
7NBt0V8ebGk,It's a very useful video. Thanks!
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thank you alex
7NBt0V8ebGk,"question on this. on the usual used case for the partition, we can show a similar result alternatively by using common table expression or even sub querying right?
you can do the group by on the CTE then join it with the main table and show that particular field from the CTE."
7NBt0V8ebGk,DONE!!!
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thank you Alex!!

7NBt0V8ebGk,your voice man It's amazing
7NBt0V8ebGk,"# ROW NUMBER, RANK Y DENSE RANK // habeis estudiado español ,if you dont know spansish please use gogle translate xD

#ROW_NUMBER
#Asigna un número único y consecutivo a cada fila, sin importar si hay empates en los valores del orden.
#Si dos filas tienen el mismo valor en la columna de orden, 
#les asigna números diferentes basándose en el orden en que aparecen.

#RANK
#Asigna números en función de un orden, pero considera los empates.
#Si dos filas empatan, se les asigna el mismo número, pero el siguiente número salta.

#DENSE_RANK
#Similar a RANK, pero no salta números tras un empate.
#Los números siempre son consecutivos.

7NBt0V8ebGk,Tremendous
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Great content, really interesting in learning new concepts Alex!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,you blow up my mind in intermediate
7NBt0V8ebGk,"hello, can you give an example of rank and dense rank in real job. when to use it?"
7NBt0V8ebGk,thank you so much for this video
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thank you Alex! This lesson is not that hard but a lot to absorb
7NBt0V8ebGk,i just can not understand... why use always .employee_id    .employee id .... Why??
7NBt0V8ebGk,"I really enjoyed learning this, this is how teaching should be, thank you for making learning easy❤"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Really amazing way, you explained it. Thankyou"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Here's a fun homework assignment for those of you playing with the lesson sets...

First, what's missing?
..
..
..
..
Ron is missing from the pool of Men! Important if you're trying to do data analysis on gender pay disparity, as is the case here. It's not uncommon to see issues like this in production where you have to clean and synthesize data from multiple tables. (Of course, in the real world, we'd be getting Ron's data added back to the demographics field, perhaps with a null for birthday)

The city manager wants to make sure that Ron Swanson is included in the buildup; use a CASE statement to assign Ron to the 'Male' field. This one's surprisingly tricky because of how the partition statement sits in the order of SQL operations."
7NBt0V8ebGk,"So, what exactly is the advantage to doing all of the groupings / averages inside of SQL, and instead of pulling it and exporting it to Excel?"
7NBt0V8ebGk,✅
7NBt0V8ebGk,I watch this video every time I have an interview and I am just realizing that all the names in the table are characters from Parks and Recreation!! :) ❤
7NBt0V8ebGk,thanks for the video!
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Took some times, but DONE !"
7NBt0V8ebGk,How can you not have Ron Swanson !!! 😭
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Hello, started the full project on ""Data Cleaning"", trying to INSERT layoffs_staging, with layoffs. My actions are correct but i am not getting any table. Dont know what i am doing wrong"
7NBt0V8ebGk,THANK YOUUU
7NBt0V8ebGk,"I just started learning, I hope I'm not too late?"
7NBt0V8ebGk,I did not get this lesson properly
7NBt0V8ebGk,"I am here in 2024, and I cannot help but commend you for all you do here. The sessions are quite interesting and well explained. However, I have a challenge with the first Window functions query you wrote. I wrote the same thing, but I keep getting the error ""gender in field list is ambiguous."""
7NBt0V8ebGk,See you all in the Advanced Series! Thank you Alex 👍
7NBt0V8ebGk,window function is good
7NBt0V8ebGk,thanks you so much alex
7NBt0V8ebGk,"I am really glad I made it here, thank you so much Alex :)"
7NBt0V8ebGk,What are the real life examples for RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions? How to know where to use which function?
7NBt0V8ebGk,Omg I really enjoyed this lecture honestly speaking to you. Thank you 🙏🙏
7NBt0V8ebGk,"the code is giving me an error, HELP!!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"awesome!!! thank you very much, now it makes sense and i really understood it well"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"I loved this session, you really kept it simple alex"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Loving the tutorials! Quick question - I tried to put in the partition by code, it looks exactly the same as in the video, but I'm getting error code 1064. why isn't it working for me? the main issue: MySQL isn't accepting a parenthesis after OVER."
7NBt0V8ebGk,Great example explanation
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thank you ! ❤
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Great video! Thanks Alex, you made something that seems quite complicated, fairly simple and easy to understand. What are some other use cases for using a Window Function? I've heard having a mastery of these is what folks in the industry use as a gauge to see if someone truly understands SQL."
7NBt0V8ebGk,Extremely organized and well explained🎉
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thank You very Much!!
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thank you Alex I like your myql course
7NBt0V8ebGk,You coulduse the using() function for joining
7NBt0V8ebGk,Alex the Analyst! You are the very best teacher!!!
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Very good! Explained clearly, simple.Very organized!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,great
7NBt0V8ebGk,Why we add  dem word with employee table and sal with salary table during join quarrt
7NBt0V8ebGk,Very clear and useful
7NBt0V8ebGk,You make it so simple.
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Sir,what level of sql solving knowledge necessary for entry level data analytics role?I am not able to build the logic to solve complex problems"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Thanks Alex,  I really appreciate these videos. :D"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"select gender, avg(salary) over()
from employee_demographics dem
join employee_salary sal
	on dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;
this is throwing a syntax error 1064 . please help"
7NBt0V8ebGk,Finally understood this lesson.
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Yet another ""WOW!"" lesson for me.  Don't think I've ever gotten to WINDOW Functions before.  Very cool.  I suppose it will all start to make more sense once I start using all of this on a regular basis.  Am REALLY glad I figured out how to run an almost current version of MySQL on my macBook Pro in macOS Sonoma.  Much simpler than using a VM, etc.  Anyway, Alex's courses have always been well worth the time I invest.  Thanks for putting up quality content Alex!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Hi Alex, I watch your tutorials, it's really nice and understandable, thanks a lot. I have a problem. Despite it all makes sense when I watch videos, I have hard time to remember these things. So what's your suggestion for making all these knowledge memory, remind it all later as well. I plan to do w3school sql tutorial as well after finishing your tutorial. But if I can get advice from you I'd appreciate."
7NBt0V8ebGk,Fantastic video for sure! Thank you!
7NBt0V8ebGk,Useful Content and Very Well Explained.
7NBt0V8ebGk,"1st half video, I am clear about these functions. I decide to skip this video but after that I get clearance for those functions. Thank you, sir..."
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Great simple video! Thanks, Alex!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Alex please, i am following your videos 100percent; please the switch is kinda much.. from database to schema. how you got to schema windows please 😥"
7NBt0V8ebGk,You are different!!!
7NBt0V8ebGk,"The concepts are explained beautifully!
Thank you! 😊"
7NBt0V8ebGk,So helpful ❤❤❤❤❤❤
7NBt0V8ebGk,"I am heads down writing a book but as soon as it is done, my next career move is to add data!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,Super useful and very clearly explained. Thank you! 🙇
7NBt0V8ebGk,thank you
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Hi. On your analystbuilder the “on the way out” question, the question says to order the output from oldest to youngest but the answer that will be counted as correct has the answer as ASC.  The true answer should be DESC."
7NBt0V8ebGk,Suggest me internship?
7NBt0V8ebGk,can someone give me the font style and size that he is using on MySQL Workbench?
7NBt0V8ebGk,Thanks Alex!
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Very organized, simple, and clear."
7NBt0V8ebGk,"finally bought course today on pandas, awesome content.
But still confused should I go for SQL also?"
7NBt0V8ebGk,"Awesome, thanks so much!  Really appreciate seeing non-basic tutorials!  Love learning new things!"
7NBt0V8ebGk,🙌🏽 😂 I love the sample names. Thank you for the videos!

Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 13/ 84   Subqueries.,"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,I started watching this series and it helped me learning mysql. Definitely a good tutorial series. Thank you. MySQL is good for many things.
Vj6RqA_X-IE,I think this is the lesson I don't understand much so far
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Done
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"i finally understand, the easier steps is you need to perform the subquery first and then you can do the main query, its so much easier to understand"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Ty Alex!! <3
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Ended day 1 here
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"thank you Alexxx, this was   bit harder than the rest but practice , practice, practice"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,First lesson I'm having a little difficulty with. Definitely will have to comeback to this. Its like i kinda get it but don't. I think practicing for another day will get me right.
Vj6RqA_X-IE,I was constantly getting avg('max(age) = 0 for both male and female. And then realized @8:45 ... I was using single quote marks instead of THIS ``
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Subqueries squeses my mind hard but by going through again and again and got every point it was a complex concept but well taught by the Legend ALEX
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"I had a hard time understanding this one,  so I asked AI and this is the answer: “Find me all customers who have placed more than 5 orders.”
You could first pull “all customers’ order‐counts” (that’s your subquery), then ask “give me those over 5” (the outer query)."" It helped me so I am leaving it here for someone who needs it!"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"I have question is that oky to start studying mysql then sql , or does that make the process easy to grasp"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"my apology, I did not understand the concept of average max. although the query was done."
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"💥💫Hello sir, you're the best💯 
From GABON"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,I must be the dumbest person. I follow along and kinda get it but at the same time I feel lost. 
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Just came from the google data analytics lesson. The Coursera video ,unfortunately, was not clear enough on subqueries ... This video is much clearer .. Thank you Alex, I knew I would find the clarification here."
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Sir, Thanks a lot for This Amazing Lecture 😊
Lecture - 5 Completed ✅ in Intermediate MySQL 🛢"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Timestamp- 3:02 

What if I want to see the salary also with these other informations? I can't return more than 1 column in operand. So how to find salary?"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Thank you Alex!
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Why could you not have been my teacher in uni huh?
Vj6RqA_X-IE,i fried my brain trying to do subquery within subquery within a query but i managed to do it in the end🤓🤕
Vj6RqA_X-IE,✅
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"I'm having trouble understanding this one.
""WHERE dept_id = 1""
Why does it return 1,3,4,5,6,12 ?
TIA"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,thankyou for the video!
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Thank you.
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Excellent explanation, thanks"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,done. a bit confusing. i need to look up to other youtube video for better and simple explanation
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Definitely the first video I started having some difficulty fully understanding. Any other resources you suggest looking at?
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"I have a question, is it not better to use JOINS instead of subqueries?. From what I understand so far."
Vj6RqA_X-IE,I don't understand why we haven't used bonus condition in same  case statement
Vj6RqA_X-IE,can someone explain me why exactly do we need to add the multiple Tabs before adding the another query 1:50
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Subquery can be denote as a virtual table. It can be use also with JOIN clause. Thanks
Vj6RqA_X-IE,where can i practice SQL section wise?
Vj6RqA_X-IE,What is the purpose of the later half of the subquery?
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"ALEX!!! Awesome guide!! This video is very easy to understand for beginners which i appreciate. Just a quick question on the aggregate function AVG in the subquiery, Why doesn't it require a GROUP BY statement?"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"At 2: 35, when you get the results of the subquery...I'm not. I'm getting the results of the full query b/c I've been hitting the bolt w/ the I on it, instead of the bolt by itself...which is what you're doing in the video, but not mentioning which bolt you're hitting and why.

Please specify which one you're hitting to get the results you're getting.

Also, I don't understand WHY you would do what you did from 8:00 on.
What's the use case for it?"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,please provide dataset it really helps to practice
Vj6RqA_X-IE,CTEs are so much more straightforward.
Vj6RqA_X-IE,we can use 3:50 self join here as well?
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Honestly it was too confusing to me (I'm starting from scratch) so I'm gonna have to learn this somewhere before I continue with the course. So frustrating 😅.
Vj6RqA_X-IE,You are a great tutor
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Thank you sir 💟
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Lord, subqueries was tough grasp"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Hello Alex I couldn't download my SQL  anyone help  me please
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"select salary,(select avg(salary) from employee_salary
) avgSalary,
case
	when salary>avgSalary then 'This employee is earning good'
end as label
from employee_salary ;


when executing this code it says there is no column as avgSalary while I renamed the output coming from subquery as avgSalary, can we not use alias while comparing it with original column?"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Thank you so much :D
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"I don't know if I missed it but does where you insert the subquery make a difference? If so, what are they so that I can better understand when I run into the need to use a subquery."
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Hiii im getting  zero in subquries
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"A LOT going on in this lesson.  Alex did a nice job of walking me through subqueries in MySQL.  As the previous commenter suggests, I need MORE practice to really get these concepts embedded into the ""gray matter"" inside my head.  At the very least, I intend to re-watch this video a couple of times without trying to keep up typing code, etc.  I am getting a great deal of value from all of Alex's work.  Thanks!  😎"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Thanks alex for the easy explanation.. just a question, when you wanted to compare the salaries to avg salary, we also can use Partition by instead of s subquery right?"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"Just when I needed to understand more about 'subqueries', this video came up. Thanks, Alex!"
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Great explanations and options. Would have been better if you included the data file link to self-practice. Remember the best way to learn is learning by doing!
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Great guy
Vj6RqA_X-IE,Loving this series ! Thanks so much
Vj6RqA_X-IE,"I am currently learning sql and I am watching your videos especially the bootcamp ones. I already finished the videos for sql, is there any platform/s you can recommend to practice what I learned from the videos? I am kind of lost on how to practice these learnings. Thank you!"

RYIiOG4LsvQ,poor Tom and jerry 😭😭
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Another day another lesson complete !
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"thank you ALexx  , we <3 uu"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,goodnight hahahahaasass
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Thank you Alex 🤗
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Justice for Jerry🤣🤣🤣
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Why do you classify me as old????? WHHHHHHHHY!
RYIiOG4LsvQ,what in the dark humor is going on here🤣🤣🤣
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Lesson#12 Conclusion
1.What is CASE statement and how it works.
2.What is the role of WHEN_THEN ,ELSE in case statement.
3.How CASE statement plays role in real word problems.

Additional practice !!! Built a sanario where you have to make salary increment based on age as well as specific position such as office manager.

In this way you will have to use JOIN statemnt as well as CASE to extract exact result."
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Alex biggest fear is aging 😭
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"select es.employee_id,concat(es.first_name,' ',es.last_name) as full_name,pd.department_name from parks_departments pd
join employee_salary es
on es.dept_id=pd.department_id
where department_name='Finance';
to check which employees are from finance department"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"I'm over 60 years of age and prepping for job interviews. You make me feel so young !!! hahah 🙂. 
Enjoying your content - keep up the good work."
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Im getting operand should contain  1 columns error on 5:08 pliz help
RYIiOG4LsvQ,DONE!!
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"what if someone is 50 years old, will the query say hes old or on death's door??"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Sir, Thanks a lot for This Amazing Lecture 😊
Lecture - 4 Completed ✅ in Intermediate MySQL 🛢"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,great learning experience
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Is everyone taking notes or is their a resource with everything in it
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Poor Jerry, no raise and on Death's door LOL"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hello, Done with this!"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"These are excellent trainings! So helpful, thank you!!"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Thank you Alex!
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Feeling sad for Tom & Jerry
RYIiOG4LsvQ,✅
RYIiOG4LsvQ,you've got a good sense of humor 😂
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"what about this I just used the ""JOINS"" from first lesson with the ""CASE STATEMENT"" do you think this is a good solution ??
@Alex

   SELECT 
    employee_salary.first_name,
    employee_salary.last_name,
    employee_salary.salary,
    parks_departments.department_name,

		ON
        employee_salary.dept_id = parks_departments.department_id
        ;"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,No ELSE statement?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"If you're a perfectionist like me, it doesn't sit well with you there are both New_Salary and Bonus columns.

Here's how to get just one column:
take the ""WHEN dept_id = 6 THEN salary * .10"" line and shove it between the two case statements above it.

Of course, you'll have to clear the second CASE...END clause, as it's of no use anymore.

Since SQL executes sequentially, it'll handle the ""Finance"" condition before the ""50k"" condition. That way, there won't be a clash on Ben Wyatt's row."
RYIiOG4LsvQ,is there any way to add bonus section just without looking at the dep_id number in parks and departments?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,You can also use the query 'else' to categorize everything outside your first or only case statement
RYIiOG4LsvQ,poor jerry cannt get a break
RYIiOG4LsvQ,when between 30 and 50 then goodnight hahahahahaa
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"There is an error (instead of salary * .10), it should be (salary * 1.10)"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"So is a 50 years old person just ""Old"" or is it already ""On Death's Door""?"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"By the way you can do else in this as well so you don't just leave a bunch of NULL: 

SELECT first_name, last_name, salary,
CASE
	WHEN salary<50000 THEN salary*1.05
    WHEN salary >=50000 THEN salary*1.07
END AS New_Salary,
CASE
	WHEN dept_id = 6 THEN salary *.10
    ELSE 0
END AS Bonus
FROM employee_salary;"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Is there a cheet sheet for all these statements and functions? Or a site to go to that's trusted by the industry? So much to learn lol
RYIiOG4LsvQ,not me being 33 and old
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Sir but if  more then one ""finance"" id how can we do then?"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hi Alex, been following the bootcamp for a longtime, I'm just wondering about the data with the employee with the dept_id 6 since he should have a 10% increase but also get affected by the other case statement of 7% increase. is there any way that the 7% increase will not affect this guy with in the finance department instead getting the 10% increase data?"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,WHEN age >= 50 'good night'
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Your tutorials and way of explaining is really really good, this stuff is really interesting and I am really enjoying studying because of you, thank you soo much!!"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"quick question, you pulled the dept_id column from a different table without identifying the table how is that possible ?"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,31 - 50 is old :(
RYIiOG4LsvQ,excuse me i'm still not understand with salary * 1.05 and salary * .10 why use 1? and in 10% for bonus is why use .10 and not 1.10?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,unfair increase rate. especially for tom and jerry. plus the imbalance increase rate resulting larger salary gap. boohoo
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Poor 50,000 salary people no increase HAHAHA"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,On death's door 💀
RYIiOG4LsvQ,thank you thank you thank you
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"poor Tom and Jerry, earning 50k doesnt grant them an increase 😂😂"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"It blows my mind how fantastic, useful and entertaining this series has been. Your delivery is absolutely on point. Thank you for putting out all this invaluable content!"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Jerry Gergich can never catch a break
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Man just cannot believe finance did an outstanding job
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"My man said “my parents gonna love me for this one” after the brutal KO, the on death’s door. 😭😂😂😂
Btw this series is amazing till now❤"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"thank you your lessons have been really helpful. Just one thing, maybe mentioning ELSE would be nice here"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Wouldn't 3rd CASE statement be >50 since second one includes age 50 already?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Between 31 and 50 old??
So, am 31, and you really dissappointed me :("
RYIiOG4LsvQ,What was your loss if you also uploaded numeric functions in this series?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Having trouble with the maths and percentages lol
RYIiOG4LsvQ,quick question -- shouldn't it be bonus of new salary i.e 10% of 74900
RYIiOG4LsvQ,This is similar to if Statement in Python.
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"My solution for the exercise:

SELECT ed.first_name, ed.last_name, pd.department_name, es.salary,
	CASE 
		WHEN es.salary < 50000 THEN (es.salary * 1.05)
		WHEN es.salary > 50000 THEN (es.salary * 1.07)
	END as new_salary,
	CASE 
		WHEN pd.department_name like 'finance' THEN (es.salary * .1)
		ELSE 0
	END as bonus
FROM employee_demographics ed 
	left join employee_salary es on ed.employee_id = es.employee_id 
	left join parks_departments pd on es.dept_id = pd.department_id
ORDER BY new_salary DESC;

And one more, a little more complex, to continue learning new concepts:

SET @LowSalaryIncrease = 1.05;
SET @HighSalaryIncrease = 1.07;
SET @SalaryThreshold = 50000;
SET @FinanceBonusRate = 0.1;

SELECT 
    ed.first_name, 
    ed.last_name, 
    pd.department_name, 
    es.salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN es.salary < @SalaryThreshold THEN (es.salary * @LowSalaryIncrease)
        WHEN es.salary >= @SalaryThreshold THEN (es.salary * @HighSalaryIncrease)
    END as new_salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN pd.department_name = 'finance' THEN (es.salary * @FinanceBonusRate)

RYIiOG4LsvQ,'On death's door' is WILD 💀💀😭😭
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"I really like your way of explaining things and giving us the real-life example on how to properly use them. Thank you for putting so much effort making this kind of content. Hope you make more, I wanna learn a lot from you!"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,on death's door 
RYIiOG4LsvQ,On death's door lol
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Poor Jerry man, he's not only old but doesn't get a raise as well. Feel bad for the bloke"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hi Alex, thank you for these videos.
How can i use the case statement as an input data?
example: 
Case end as Salary_increase,
salary + salary_increase as New_salary

SQL is not recognizing salary_increase as a new column that i can use."
RYIiOG4LsvQ,I understand everything he studied us but can't practice because I don't have data
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"I use something like a CASE Statement in Excel's Power Query A LOT.  Very powerful.  Same idea as a CASE statement in MySQL (and probably MSSQLSVR, PostreSQL, etc.)  Another ""Thumbs Up"" lesson in my opinion.  Glad to have this treasure trove of knowledge to fall back on if I get stuck going down a MySQL rabbit hole (Read in your best ""Elmer Fudd"" voice - Got to love those rascally rabbits...😁)"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Where can I find this dataset?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"In case of finance, Isn't it the salary should be as per 5 or 7 %  as per the bracket and Bonus should be 10%? Bcoz bonus is one time only."
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Alex can you please provide a discount code for your website? Can you also suggest/recommend what course should I begin with. Please respond 😇 
I don’t mean to spam your comment section. Just hoping to grab your attention."
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hello Alex, I have about 15 years of software engineering experience in java ecosystem.
Been a hard-core programmer throughout my career.

Lately been thinking of adding any worthy skill set to boost my career.

Do you think something like a data analyst would be apt for me?"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,What do you think about rapidly increasing adoption of Databricks?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,may I know how to download these tables?
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hello Alex, your positive impact on lives is evident, and I've been following your journey. Your work is commendable. I'm eager to collaborate with you to make a difference in the lives of struggling youth who are losing hope due to unemployment, turning to substances. Together, we can bring positive change."""
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Hello can you do a video into how to download a csv file faster into mysql. I was able to prep the csv file and create table and the datatypes for it but i ran into the problem of error code 1265
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"omg, i'm working on a project of my own with the exact same table title. this is great timing!"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Ron's age/birthday data isn't there 😂😂😂
RYIiOG4LsvQ,Loved it!
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Great vid, i would use the statement of finance id as first statement and then add the 2 consequtive when end"
RYIiOG4LsvQ,thank you
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hi Alex, this is so interesting and pretty fascinating.
I would like to ask, which do you think is pretty simple not to get confused with when writing the ""New_Salary"" equation? Is it writing the full equation as ""Salary + (Salary * 0.05) for 5% increase or writing it as ""Salary * 1.05"""
RYIiOG4LsvQ,"Hey Alex, your MySQL lessons are fantastic! Could you please upload them a bit faster? I have an upcoming interview and I'd love to practice more before then. Thanks so much!"

_nf56aMPdZE,"Copilot is incredibly annoying in Word. It's easy to turn off though. File>Options>Copilot, uncheck the box. Done."
_nf56aMPdZE,"No matter how many courses I have taken in Excel advance I'm crap at it, once copilot is rolled out at full capabilities is going to be a game changer ✨"
_nf56aMPdZE,It feels like a beta version of a half-cooked product at this point.
_nf56aMPdZE,Very helpful. TY!
_nf56aMPdZE,😂😂
_nf56aMPdZE,Super Alex do you have supercharge excel tool separately paid version let me know
_nf56aMPdZE,It bothered me that it didn't give a 2-digit month or day when you specifically told it mm/dd/yyyy... But this was super helpful as I'm deciding whether to purchase this or not.
_nf56aMPdZE,please make videos on Agricultural design Statistical analysis analysis
_nf56aMPdZE,Can copilot analysis Cvs.file
_nf56aMPdZE,You have to have co poilot Pro to do all this you need to make this clear. Mine is just co poilot advance
_nf56aMPdZE,"Nice video, underwhelming program... So much potential though 😭"
_nf56aMPdZE,Clippit... 2.0
_nf56aMPdZE,How much copilot can improve user experience?
_nf56aMPdZE,ChatGPT goes Omni version
_nf56aMPdZE,Generally it is pretty weak
_nf56aMPdZE,20 dollars for this? Thats way overprized. Most people will just use chatgpt and CTRL+C and CTRL+V. In Excel its really really bad as well. Maybe i was expecting too much.
_nf56aMPdZE,"This was too basic for me, but it gives a bit about where to find and maybe leverage copilot.

I might have to finish this later."
_nf56aMPdZE,"I agree Copilot for excel it’s not great for data analyst/ data Science types. I just took a copilot  for a test run today and couldn’t get it to do anything more than some superficial stuff ( I tried to get it to run a simple linear regression on a small dataset of advertising expenditure vs sales data… which I can get to work using a program like Chat GPT 4)… copilot failed miserably, basically said you couldn’t do regressions in excel (which I guess is technically true without data analysis add in enabled).

That said… I agree it might be useful for people who have no idea how to use excel. The problem with that conclusion… is that I feel like copilot is an expensive add on and it doesn’t really seemed to be marketed to that demographic of user. Like all the promotional stuff the last year seemed targeted to more power users. It requires you have a business 365 license… which I mean most people running that at least have a decent working knowledge of MS Office.

So 🤷‍♂️. I’ll play around with more another week before
Rendering a final verdict— but off the cuff first impression— I’m not that impressed with it— seems more like Mr, Clippy from yesteryear."
_nf56aMPdZE,"At least as a DA, we do not need to feel scared that AI would replace our work because they do have some limitations. ☺"
_nf56aMPdZE,"Copilot SUCKS, it pops up no matter what I'm doing, shame on you for pushing this annoying garbage!"
_nf56aMPdZE,Thanks Alex! Easy to watch and informative!
_nf56aMPdZE,"Just like with Gemini there is a built in bias in responses, such as the response I received to the name of a Brother that taught me in Catholic High School. It preceded the response to the Brother's details with a paragraph of another Brother who 30 years later was found to have kid porn on his computer. Totally irrelevant to the question asked, but obviously part of the anti Catholic algorithm!!"
_nf56aMPdZE,"Thanks Alex for the video, great overview. I run office on 2021, not 360, so I'm guessing users like me also have to factor in this second subscription. I'd say from what you shared for a non-beginner like me probably not worth it. I'm sure this service will get much better (although maybe pricier too) in the months and years ahead though."
_nf56aMPdZE,I’m not impressed.
_nf56aMPdZE,Hey can you show an a video how to download a csv file faster into mysql. The csv file im trying to download is big. Im not able to use excel or the free version since the file is to big for me to fix some stuff on the data.
_nf56aMPdZE,"i am farmer and its really hard for me to keep the record of data mostly money like crop costs or lend money from others i thought i could use AI on my mobile inside copilot chat app like just writing add 500 in fertilizer column or add 2000 earning in 2023 wheat or paddy 2023  its a hassle to start my desktop and write one particular thing i could do it on the time sometimes i forget i got money from that guy or gave him this amount of money i am pretty much sure Microsoft can do this and they will improve this in future but they are just scared from people for there privacy breached like people would criticise them for it i would love to get that type of thing with AI and i dont know i can pay 20 dollars but i think AI should be free in future at least it should like google search engine was copilot chat is already free tho so that's good thing

I am not going to pay for copilot until they do this type of improvement"
_nf56aMPdZE,Doesn't work for me on desktop word. Online word Copilot is slow or just stops mid answer. Support sucks. ChatGpt 4 is much better so far.
_nf56aMPdZE,"This is waste of computer space.  Did not give my an useful answers to my questions.  Microsoft installed it without my permission.  From a personal use, use at home, it's absolute garbage.  You're better of using google.  At there you can scroll down the results to get the information you actual need."
_nf56aMPdZE,"Been waiting for this. it is expensive, given that it comes on top of the Office 365 subscription and has mediocre functionality. This iteration is def not worth the $; better to learn Excel 😜"
_nf56aMPdZE,"Seems to me it will only help people who have very limited skills in excel. Changing a data format is much easier to do manually. could do it in the time it took to type the requirement. A product like this surely comes in to its own when you have a ton of data, so it not being able to handle or help with the more complicated areas such as splitting out text in one column is weakness. Again can be done by formula find or using the other built in separation tools. 7/10 for basic users, for more advanced it looks more like a 3/10.  Good video though as totally informative and balanced."
_nf56aMPdZE,"Can anyone give me the link of 
Alex job site for data job only"
_nf56aMPdZE,"This is what happens when you let cortana use chatgpt for work. It has no idea what it's doing, but it'll do it nontheless."
_nf56aMPdZE,We need a series video on it...thanks Alex.
_nf56aMPdZE,"Wow, thank you Alex for taking the time for the ""unboxing"" and the walkthough video of Copilot in Excel and the other Microsoft apps. I appreciate your assessments of the limitations as well.

Wondering what you think of the comparison of Copilot in Excel vs comparable Gen AI features in Tableau, PowerBI, Cognos, and Hex?"
_nf56aMPdZE,"25 seconds is a long time , a look back at this video a few years down the road will be interesting"
_nf56aMPdZE,It takes longer to ask the question than doing the action  eg filtering....I love how diplomatic you are about it😊
_nf56aMPdZE,will it be a good decision to continue learning data analyst skills being an arts student(M.A. in geography) in 2024?
_nf56aMPdZE,How to get intanship in data analyst find
_nf56aMPdZE,"Great video as always. It looks like a great tool, but with everything free out there, I'll wait until MS inevitably makes it inherent in Windows 29 and spend my money on investments like cheese nachos with extra hot sauce"
_nf56aMPdZE,Interesting discoveries about the copilot. Thanks Alex!
_nf56aMPdZE,Hello sir .
_nf56aMPdZE,That's very informative for sure I can't waiting using it
_nf56aMPdZE,"plus, you need an Office 365 subscription as well!"

KRXSJb9ql1Y,Awesome
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"je n'arrive pas à utiliser ""concat"" avec des colonne où il y a des allias."
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Done
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"in this session all the functions just look like excel function, not too hard to follow for me"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,I showed up again today!
KRXSJb9ql1Y,thank you so much ALEX <3
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Thank you so much
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Excellent lesson! Thank you
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"if anyone watching this right now, I would like to add one more
-- CAST (x,y) x= value: y=datatype(signed(-inf - +inf), unsigned(0 - +inf), string, decimal etc.)
helps to solve problems such as replacing numerical values in the dataset if any typo occurs, hope it helps : )"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Could you explain why and how you used the value of '2"" to ORDER BY? 

I don't understand, it seems so random. When I use the value '1' it gives me a seemingly random output."
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Hey~ I was wondering why the LENGTH() Function would not be a built in function name for mySQL?
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Lesson#11 Conclusion

So we have covered multiple string functions
1.LENGTH ==> This will calculates the total no. of characters present in the desired output
2.UPPER ==> To convert all the characters to uppercase form.
3.LOWER ==> To convert all the characters to lowercase form.
4.TRIM ==> Removes unwanted blank spaces from left and right.
    *LTRIM ==> Removes unwanted blank spaces from left side only.
    *RTRIM ==>Removes unwanted blank spaces from lright side only.
5.LEFT ==> To select specific character starting from the left side.
6.RIGHT ==>To select specific character starting from the right side.
7.SUBSRING ==> To select specific characters by mentioning start and end points.
8.REPLACE ==> To replace specific character with the desired character.
9.LOCATE ==> This will locate specific characters with 0 if not found 1 if found.
10.CONCATE ==> This will combine the characters of 2 different coloumns.


SUBSTRING & CONCAT both string functions are very important and widly used in real world projects."
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Why did ORDER BY 2 make it go from shortest to longest?
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Replace, I understand that lower case “a” replaces all lower case letters associated in the table and vice verse, but what if you want to replace all As related to that query ?"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,DONE!
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Alex, you're the BEEEEST"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,1: 27  Excuse me sir but why 2 in the order ? Is that a specific value to order names ? Thank you so much for all your help

KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Hey, @Alex, thank you for this bootcamp videos. Where can I practice what you teach in these videos?"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"If you're following along in SQL instead of MySQL use ""LEN"" instead of ""LENGTH"". Use ""CHARINDEX"" instead of ""LOCATE"""

KRXSJb9ql1Y,✅ complete
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Hi everyone,  

I keep getting '10' as the length of the first name.

What could i be doing wrong?"

- `right(str, n)`: (str) The last `n` characters of `str.
- `substring(str, n, m)` (also `substr()`): (str) An `m`-long substring starting at the `n`-th character of `str`.
- `replace(str, sub1, sub2)`: (str) `str` with all instances of `sub1` replaced with `sub2`.
- `locate(sub, str)`: (int) Position of `sub` in `str` (1-based index).
- `concat(str1, str2, ...)`: (str) Concatenation of `str1` and `str2`.

**Bonus:**
- `instr(str, sub)`: (int) Position of `sub` in `str` (1-based index).

Please let me know if there is anything wrong. Thanks!"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Hi i know its been long, i really hope i get a response, i have been following up to this point.
8:57 of this video, REPLACE String function, you used 'A' to be replaced with 'Z', but the name ""Ann"", the 'A' wasn't replaced. why?"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,What order by 2 means?
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"string functions are used to manipulate and work with text strings. 
common string functions with real-world uses:

- CONCAT(): Combines multiple strings into one (e.g., full names).
- LENGTH(): Returns the length of a string (e.g., checking password length).
- LOWER()/UPPER(): Converts a string to lowercase or uppercase (e.g., email validation).
- SUBSTRING(): Extracts part of a string (e.g., area codes).
- TRIM(): Removes extra spaces (e.g., cleaning user input).
- REPLACE(): Replaces occurrences of a substring (e.g., updating city names)."
KRXSJb9ql1Y,My 'Select' and 'From' are always lower case. Anyone else?
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Very effective lesson with direct key points. Really appreciate your effort, Alex"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Is there a way to make the first letter of all names UPPER and the rest LOWER?
KRXSJb9ql1Y,I love when you specify when you actually use which functions at your real world job and when functions are less used. Gives a good idea of what is to come in a job
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"9:17 with the ""REPLACE"" is there any way to recognize both lower and uppercase?"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"You are a great teacher, Alex. Wish you all the best."
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Interesting
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Thank you Sir❤
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Hello how can I download this data??
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Hmmm...  Wonder how I managed to get my comment about the UNION lesson in the String Functions lesson????  Guess I should have been paying more attention to detail...!  That said, this lesson on String Functions of succinct and clear.  Everything works as advertised and it all makes sense.  Nice job Alex!"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Well, that was fun!  Ending my day with Alex the Analyst while my lovely Bride is preparing dinner (I'm one lucky 'Wanna-Be-Data-Nerd').  Somehow UNION just makes more sense than JOINS for me.  I just need more exposure and practice - like this Intermediate MySQL Series for example.  Thanks again Alex! 😎"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,You and semicolons 😂
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Can you show in mysql how to download csv files faster
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Thank you Alex. Just wanted to drop a quick note to say how much i loved your video
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Hi Alex, i am having 10 years of experience as  a Quality analyst in banking,can you please help me to suggest if self-study or doing a master's is a good option"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Hi Alex, I want to start learning Data analysis and the laptop I chose to buy has a i5 13420h cpu (16gb ram, 1tb ssd) What do you think about the cpu? is it good enough for me to get started?"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Great stuff 😊✌️
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Sorry one question, why in your roadmap abou data analyst you dont talk about Statistics skills. Thanks"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,"Am I getting it right that in order to extract the month from the date using SUBSRTING the date should be in a string format, not a date?"
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Awesome session. I love the functionalities of these strings in data cleaning. Thanks Alex!
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Is it really intermediate?
KRXSJb9ql1Y,Very informative thanks Alex

iTQW_nDp938,"I need help with this pls, seems everyday I open my MySQL there's always an issue with the tables. Just tried it again and same error message executing the UNION query:  

select gender, age

iTQW_nDp938,"In terms of technical exercises, this was a great activity. The comments section is lively - kudos on that; examples like this are exactly why ethics/humanities/philosophy courses are part of the business school requirement. Modern analytics empowers you to do many illegal and unethical things like this, and it's important to take a moment and acknowledge that while this is something you *can* do, it's not something you *should* do. Would have liked to see that discussion in the video as well, though I get that you're going for satire here."
iTQW_nDp938,Thank you Alex!
iTQW_nDp938,This topic is quite hilarious; thank you for being honest with us Alex. Done with this tutorial.
iTQW_nDp938,Knocked this one out too whoop!
iTQW_nDp938,poor Mr. Gergich
iTQW_nDp938,"Ever since I found this channel my SQL learning has become easier. Thanks Alex, you did a great job."

iTQW_nDp938,"Can i anybody how he is using old first time,he says it is a label. I know alias but i don't know label.Can anybody explain?"
iTQW_nDp938,Wow i heard the tech industry was age-ist. This video just made my anxiety go through the roof. We're going to push folks out for being old at 40 years old? i'm 44. should i even bother switching my career to data analysis?
iTQW_nDp938,"UNION is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set.  key points about using UNION:

Distinct rows only: By default, UNION removes duplicate rows.
Same number of columns: Each SELECT query must have the same number of columns.
Column data types must match: The corresponding columns should have compatible data types.

You can use UNION ALL if you want to keep duplicate rows in the final result."
iTQW_nDp938,omg not you calling Jerry old
iTQW_nDp938,40 is middle age not old 😀
iTQW_nDp938,"SELECT CAST(age as varchar(50)) as age, gender -->      if you are struggling with the first example try this."

iTQW_nDp938,superb!
iTQW_nDp938,"At 6.25, why ORDER BY not only first_name? result will be the same. Then why last_name included?"
iTQW_nDp938,You say at 4:55 that the age 50 is too low and lower it further to 40 😂
iTQW_nDp938,"Couldn't understand a thing on this topic on Udemy, but you lay it down simple here. Glad there's a channel like this."
iTQW_nDp938,Don't push out those older employees LOL
iTQW_nDp938,wow
iTQW_nDp938,"What a weird use case, discriminating  against employees over 40 ( 'Old men"" and 'Old Ladies') and cutting salaries or firing high-paid employees. ""i've done something similar to this in my real job.' Charming."
iTQW_nDp938,"""If someone is over 50 years old, we're gonna try to push them out""
Sir that's ILLEGAL 🤣"
iTQW_nDp938,"quick note

if you have UNEQUAL ROWS 
set the columns which are present on the econd database table but not the fist database table as NULL
set the columns which are present on the first database table but not the second database table as NULL

since union actually merges so it will create additional rows to merge those columns NOW IF WE PUT NUILL IT WILL MATCH THE UMBER OF ROWS"

lXQzD09BOH0,Right join is used by arabs. This is because they read and write backwards.
lXQzD09BOH0,Very useful video!
lXQzD09BOH0,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 9/ 84  .. INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, SELF, FULL OUTER JOINTS.."
lXQzD09BOH0,Is there a way to make the secret santa table so that we also have a row where it shows that Craig Middlebrooks is the secret santa for Leslie Knope? At the moment Craig isn't the secret santa for anyone and Leslie won't be getting a gift this year. 😄
lXQzD09BOH0,I kinda don't understand joins
lXQzD09BOH0,Completed
lXQzD09BOH0,where can i get the excel file ?
lXQzD09BOH0,"So you can basically with these commands that you show filter the grid with any combination. But can you other functions. Like calculations or automation, or something like that. Thank you for these videos. They have been very helpful"
lXQzD09BOH0,"This video explains so much better than any other tutorial or courses i enrolled in, eg: Database Management Essentials
by University of Colorado System on Coursera, not recommended."
lXQzD09BOH0,the multiple join clause is missing employee id 10. I cant figure out why it is missing once adding the second join statement. shouldnt #10 (Andy) be pulled in from the salary table??? @ 16:23
lXQzD09BOH0,Day 6 but Day 1 of intermediate complete ☑
lXQzD09BOH0,And how do you loop back so that employee 12 is the santa for employee 1? We went from 12 rows to 11 rows by joining the same table together.
lXQzD09BOH0,"please provide the data of sql on which u perform all the queries , thnakyou for this ultimate and amzing  plylist"
lXQzD09BOH0,"Thanks. Your way of teaching is fantastic, Alex"

lXQzD09BOH0,"After installing MySQL, I closed the tab. The next time I tried to open it, I could not see it again. What do I do here?"
lXQzD09BOH0,"Hey Alex, is it okay if I go through some bootcamps first to get hands-on experience, and then later enroll in certifications like the Google Data Analytics Certification? Just trying to build a solid foundation before diving into formal credentials."
lXQzD09BOH0,I had to google what does it mean by Secret Santa in order to understand the whole concept 😂
lXQzD09BOH0,"Joint is used for connecting two or multiple of self tables with one columned synced. Icluding:
- (INNER) JOIN: connect two tables by returning rows with matching values in both tables
- (LEFT/RIGHT) JOIN: connect two table with whole left/right vales and matching values in the opposite
How to use?
WHERE table 1 
(LEFT/RIGHT) JOIN table 2
ON table1.column = table2.column"
lXQzD09BOH0,"hi, please at the self join part (santa illustration) wanted to know who will be buying for leslie. It looks like the first employee will be omitted from emp 2 side. She has no santa"
lXQzD09BOH0,Anyone doing this in March 2025???Lets connect
lXQzD09BOH0,i made the same code with join instead of inner join and it gives the same results i didnt get what is the difference can you explain please
lXQzD09BOH0,"Hey Alex, how are you? I'm using your guides to practice SQL, and while checking the code you provided on Git for this class, I found a comment in the Self Join section which stated that Mark didn't get a santa since his id was the last one on the DEM table. But, as I see it, it would be Leslie that would not get a santa (She would be the Santa for Ron), since she has the first id, and by the code, no one would get to be hers. Am I getting something wrong?

This could be a language barrier, as I'm not a native english speaker.

Thanks for everything so far :)"
lXQzD09BOH0,thank you so much sir
lXQzD09BOH0,done!!
lXQzD09BOH0,"I could be thinking too far ahead, but how do I memorize all of this?. Should I just save the codes and reuse them?"
lXQzD09BOH0,I'm following along and honestly haven't felt this stupid in a while. Is it better to go back and rewatch some videos or continue going forward until it all clicks ? 😅😅
lXQzD09BOH0,Ron Swanson not being in the demographics table is the funniest for folks who've seen the show hahaha - very clever!
lXQzD09BOH0,i got to ask is ok start the intermediate while not understanding some of the beginner  or should i stay there until everything is fine ?
lXQzD09BOH0,Excellent explanation of Joins.  I'm more familiar with them in Excel but that's one of the best explanations I've heard.
lXQzD09BOH0,"kinda bit confused with the self join, especially with the function, can you explain why we have to use self join in a real schenario in our job ?"
lXQzD09BOH0,You are the best Alex!! 🤩
lXQzD09BOH0,"I didn’t understand the concept of self join and Santa's role in it. Can anyone explain this concept, please? 😢"
lXQzD09BOH0,90% of it

lXQzD09BOH0,"hi  from 7:45 , i am getting an error code : 1146. Table 'sys.employee_salary' doesn't exist ? .."
lXQzD09BOH0,"I love this video. So clear! And seeing the data is really helpful. I finally really get the Left Join vs Right Join, so thank you so much! <3 

I'm new to SQL, so I don't know if there are others missing, but I like JOIN USING. Wondering how that got left out...? Still my favorite video on joins, though."

lXQzD09BOH0,"INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows with matches in both tables.
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table. If there's no match, it shows NULL for the right table's columns.
RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table. If there's no match, it shows NULL for the left table's columns.
FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from both tables. Where there's no match, it shows NULL for the missing side.
CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (all possible row combinations).
SELF JOIN: Joins a table with itself."

How will this change the resulting table when ran?"
lXQzD09BOH0,in the analyst builder course is it the same as this one or different? thank you for those who will answer :)
lXQzD09BOH0,16:29 in here yes the department works fine but still salary employee id = 2 Ron is missing. So the table is missing the rows. So my question is why we didnt do right join in the first join code while joining multiple tables together? So instead of missing it we could have null value on dem table. idk it came to me more logical and feeling sth is wrong and missing infos with this way. ​ @AlexTheAnalyst
lXQzD09BOH0,"joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. types of joins:

- INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
- LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If no match, returns NULL for right table.
- RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Similar to LEFT JOIN but returns all rows from the right table.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns rows when there is a match in either table, or NULL when no match exists.

Each join serves different purposes based on the relationships between your data tables."

3 TYPES OF JOINS :
1. INNER JOIN 
2. OUTER JOIN [LEFT OUTER JOIN & RIGHT OUTER JOIN]
3. SELF JOIN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INNER JOIN : RESULT WILL BE THE ONLY VALUES WHICH WILL MATCH IN BOTH TABLE1 & TABLE2 .
2.1 OUTER JOIN [LEFT] : RETURNS ALL THE VALUES FROM LEFT AND RIGHT TABLE , BUT IF THERE ARE ANY MISSING VALUES FROM                 RIGHT TABLE THEN IT REPRESENTS THEM AS NULL INSTEAD OF DELETING THAT ROW . 
2.2 OUTER[RIGHT]: RETURNS ALL THE VALUES FROM RIGHT AND LEFT TABLE , BUT IF THERE ARE ANY MISSING VALUES FROM LEFT TABLE THEN IT REPRESENTS THEM AS NULL INSTEAD OF DELETING THAT ROW .
3. SELF : THE TABLE IS JOINED WITHIN ITSELF [TABLE1, TABLE1 SITUATION ] OR SELF JOINED TABLES 🤔🤔"

KZKizyBS9YM,"By doing your SQL 
course will I be able to answer the very hard questions?"
KZKizyBS9YM,"My immediate concern was the leading spaces when you wrote the query! So glad you addressed it. Once I write a query that accounts for a leading or trailing space, the immediate question I would ask if I need to account for it in the output. If the answer is yes, I address it immediately once I have figured out the query so I don't forget.
If you really want it tricky, you'd throw in an address or two with dashes in the city or address. But that's be a very very hard video as opposed to a very hard video. Throw in foreign addresses and you'd get darn near impossible lol"
KZKizyBS9YM,I started to learn SQL earlier but had to pause for a while because of school... Now I'm starting again. Thanks for these tutorials and real-life examples

I’m working on doing some projects and putting together my portfolio, but man it’s so hard to put all of the skills together and know what to do and when to use certain tools. 

I’m starting to get some of those valley of despair feelings. Do you, or anyone else for that matter, have any advice or tips on getting through knowing the technical skills but not knowing how to implement them?"

Mod returns the remainder of long division"

GZS7AgQ4Ksg,"1. Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving
Why it's important: Data analysts need to identify trends, uncover patterns, and derive meaningful insights from raw data.
Example: Knowing how to decide whether a dataset is relevant for solving a specific business problem.
2. Communication Skills
Why it's important: Data insights must be explained clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
Example: Presenting data visualizations or creating reports that executives can understand and act on.
Tip: Use storytelling techniques to make your data relatable.
3. Collaboration and Teamwork
Why it's important: Analysts often work with cross-functional teams, such as marketing, finance, or engineering.
Example: Collaborating with software engineers to understand data pipelines or with marketing to evaluate campaign success.
4. Adaptability and Continuous Learning
Why it's important: The field of data analysis evolves quickly with new tools and techniques emerging frequently.
Example: Adapting to a switch from Excel to Python or learning new BI tools like Tableau.
5. Attention to Detail
Why it's important: Mistakes in data analysis can lead to incorrect business decisions.
Example: Spotting anomalies in data or ensuring data cleanliness before analysis.
6. Time Management and Prioritization
Why it's important: Analysts often juggle multiple projects with tight deadlines.
Example: Deciding which data analysis task will have the most business impact.
7. Curiosity and a Growth Mindset
Why it's important: Curiosity drives you to ask the right questions and dig deeper into the data.
Example: Investigating an unexpected trend to uncover root causes or hidden opportunities.
8. Empathy and User-Centric Thinking
Why it's important: Helps you understand stakeholder needs and tailor your analysis to solve their specific problems.
Example: Framing your analysis in a way that addresses a marketing manager's key goals instead of delivering raw numbers.
9. Presentation and Storytelling
Why it's important: The ability to create compelling stories from data ensures that your insights drive action.
Example: Using charts, dashboards, or PowerPoint to make a compelling case for a decision.
10. Problem Decomposition
Why it's important: Large problems often need to be broken into smaller, manageable tasks.
Example: Breaking down a revenue drop into region-specific, time-specific, or product-specific trends."

fT-8mRf_-Hk,Thank you Alex for making Data Analysis understandable and easy. Much love from Nigeria
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Thanks a ton for doing this! The clarity and simplicity is just phenomenal!
fT-8mRf_-Hk,could be please make it free as i am from india and 34dollars is too much here
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Just started learning sql on Udemy this week and I am doing pretty good so far with answering your interview questions
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"i'm a little confused about the Senior Citizen Discount question, i've seen the solution it says to use the timestampdiff but is there any alternate way to solfe this question in mysql? 

#SELECT customer_id 
#FROM customers 
#where 2023 - year(birth_date) >= 55
#where date_sub('2023-01-01',birth_date) >= 55
#order by customer_id asc;


i've tried a few different ways but not getting the desired output 
thanks."
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Thank you very much, Alex! I just finished watching all your boot camp videos. They are really very helpful for beginners. And thank you for recommending this Analystsbuilder, which is really useful for practicing ❤❤❤really appreciate your help and hard work 😊"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Is it just me or does anyone else also feels these are beginner level problems?
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Some of the easy questions start turning into medium questions when you consider the nested functions like with the COSTCO ROTISERIE CHICKEN scenario.                                                                   SELECT ROUND(CAST(SUM(lost_revenue_millions) AS DECIMAL), 0) AS Total_Loss  FROM sales;   
I have an easier time with temp tables, stored procs, creating and inserting into tables than I do nested functions.  But still, great learning tool Alex!!!!!"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,This is really a great platform
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Honestly these questions are easy level
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Thanks for sharing always
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"As these interview questions get more difficult, it also gets more important to validate the data. In the second example, the data set is small enough to visually confirm that the error is uniform.

If that dataset was 10,000+ rows long, it will not be practical nor would it be possible to validate the data visually. I’d be asking what types of assumptions do I have with the text and how do I write queries that would check against those assumptions. (E.g., do the names have any trailing or leading space? Is the naming convention for the error always a concatenation of the ID at the beginning or can the error show as First Name and then ID?)

Depending on how big your testing dataset is and who you are speaking to, the thought process can be scaled up or down accordingly."
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Hi Alex. 

There is an issue in ""Senior Citizen Discount"" moderate SQL question. The task says ""If a customer is 55 or above they qualify"" - this should be meaning "">="" condition. But it is not accepted as correct by the system. I get ""your solution is correct"" only if I change to "">"", which contradicts the task."
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"This is great! I'm taking the free Harvard SQL course online, and seeing that these queries are medium-difficulty is encouraging to me... everything made sense and is very straightforward. I really look forward to learning more SQL and getting into this industry!"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Thanks for the website Alex. One thing I would say is after doing medium SQL questions on websites such as stratascratch the ones on analyst builder are much easier. I've only been doing SQL a couple months and can get a majority of the medium questions correct on your website but fail to get most of them on other websites. If I'm applying to entry level DA and DS roles should I be ok if I can answer the medium questions on analyst builder?
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"I've shared your channel with so many Alex, so good! I am an ""old"" lady now lol but thinking of documenting my journey of learning SQL and seeing where it takes me. =)  Maybe inspire some Gen Xers."
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Loving these practice videos
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Alex never fails to show something fresh and interesting! Props!
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"hey,alex for Cake vs Pie Question(Hard) does using Pivot function make more sense?because its advance and its corresponds to level of challenge. this is how i solved it

fT-8mRf_-Hk,"I guess everyone has a different definition of easy, medium, and hard because datalemurs easy questions are hard for me 😅. Id say this is easy - medium, too"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Best thing i learn to write down what we need to do in query 🎉🎉🎉
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Great content. Your presentation setup and communication skills are superb. One minor suggestion is to be mindful of formatting best practices e.g. each column name on the next line preceeded by its separator comma.   
I just unraveled a spaghetti noodle factory of self-taught SQL and the poor formatting added a lot of time.   Reading code that is consistently formatted speeds up an analyst's work and following formatting best practices is a sign of your professionalism in an interview."
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Amazing lesson, Alex! Now, I feel confident to delve deeper into SQL knowledge through the AnalystBuilder website, and more importantly, to excel in SQL interview questions.
Thanks a million!"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"He, Alex! Thanks for the videos) looking forward to python tasks) anyway, have you checked the links to udemy courses on different geo? I'm from Kazakhstan and I can't go to the courses you recommend. I've just recently been thinking about taking a statistics course for ds and here you are😊"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"If things went well, I will share my story and main thanks would be to you and your channel , thank you so much for all of your efforts 🙏"

fT-8mRf_-Hk,Excellent Info and useful for interview preparation.
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Been working through your exercise prompts. I have a quick question. In MSSQL why is it required to CAST int into decimals to conduct equations between columns? It is not required in MYSQL.
fT-8mRf_-Hk,I think these should be classified as Easy not Medium
fT-8mRf_-Hk,I started solving SQL daily because of this series. Thanks a lot and please do continue
fT-8mRf_-Hk,"Hey Hi Alex, I am facing issue with downloading the excel dataset for the PowerBI final project from github so could you please resolve that issue if possible I have even commented on that and shared my mailID"
fT-8mRf_-Hk,Hi please can we get the dataset  to work on our own 🙂

ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Hello Alex, thanks for all you do. It is inspiring! I would like to know regarding the car inspection question, should the minor issues not be written as minor issues >3 since the question said a car with minor issues more than 3 will fail."
ZHaYOC0H5KE,Thanks🎉. I have no regret of buying Analyst Builder Course Bundle. Cheers !!!
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Thank you so much, Alex! It was a great video SQL lesson. I appreciate it, and looking forward to the next SQL interview questions."
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Great video! One thing I would add is that not all interviewees will get a chance to live code as part of their interview process; some will only send this question to you as a take-home. The expectation, then, is to send back the query (unless the questions explicitly ask you to elaborate more on your thought process). In this basic query, though, the comments should suffice in succinctly conveying the thought process.

I was lucky enough to have a senior data analyst go back-and-forth with me to learn SQL. To be fair, it was SQL Developer, which is a less ""conventional"" SQL language..."
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"I will have to try Analyst Builder out.  Recently I had a PostGre SQL technical test (after applying but before any interview) thru CODILITY and absolutely hated the platform so much so it was throwing me off, and I've been using SQL Server and SAS for years.   It wouldn't even allow me to SELECT * FROM TABLE to see the initial data set, basically the system seemed like I would only be allowed to enter the final solution without working my way thru it."
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Yes, I enjoyed the video

Thanks so much for sharing Alex."
ZHaYOC0H5KE,Over 65 usually includes 65. I would clarify that with HR
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Hi Alex, looking at becoming a data analyst this year and I have been following your boot camps. I would like to ask a question; Most of the softwares used in your videos are done on a PC my question is what is your advise for people with MacBook, is it possible to learn on them (SQL, Tableau etc)?"
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"I am such a huge fan of your comments in the editor. 

Plus the concept of “explaining your thought process to the technical interviewer”. 

Great way by build the confidence as well if you actually know the theory behind what you are doing 🎉"
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"I totally bombed on an interview with Amazon for a BI Engineer about a month ago.  I have been out of work for over a year and forgot basic syntax.  I also was not prepared for how they just paste a bunch of text into the chat window and say ""Pretend these are records in a database and write a query that...""  I thought I would get access to a database, get my queries together, and paste them into the chat window."
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"really words can't describe how much all of us are grateful for u for making everything east for us , thanks alot , hope you r doing great"
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"This is easily the best data analyst channel on YouTube, no one else is putting out content like this. Really appreciate it"
ZHaYOC0H5KE,Nice sh!t Alex! :)
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Please we need more exercise on this , thank you very much Mr Alex_Analyst 
And please can you differentiate ( or explain with a short )between SQL and MySQL and other versions because I don't really know their differences and similarities, and again do we have to pay to access the website before going through these examples ?
Thank you in advance 🤲"
ZHaYOC0H5KE,"Hi Alex plz upload the power bi ,and tableau interview questions  also"

K0-8G3DgjA4,what school you can sugget in NYC?
K0-8G3DgjA4,Great video! I created a Notion + GPT system to track my data analyst learning path - it really helps me stay focused and consistent
K0-8G3DgjA4,Do you know anything about operations research analysis? I think that’s the field I wanna go into but I want to learn data analysis first as a stepping stone!
K0-8G3DgjA4,l will start in july
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Hola soy de Argentina, tengo 33 años y soy Licenciado en seguridad e higiene en el trabajo. Hace unas semanas estuve investigando sobre como ser analista de datos. Y si llegue solo a esa conclusión de los 3 software para aprender incialmente. Hice slgunas cositas con ytb por mi cuenta, luego comence a ""auditar"" el curso de data analyst de google en coursera. Al final me suscribi para conseguir ese certificado. Ya voy a 50%  del primero de los 9 cursos. (Empece la semana pasada) Muy bien explicado. Aunque seguramente tarde más del tiempo que dices, porque tengo 2 trabajos part time al mismo tiempo."
K0-8G3DgjA4,I applied for an IT position and they offered me Data Analyst with me having ZERO experience. I'm ready to learn 😊

K0-8G3DgjA4,I have a question that I'd really appreciate your honesty without sugar coating it. I'm 54 who has jumped from job to job most of my life with low paid jobs. I actually have a little experience in 1st Line Technical Support so I consider myself to be a bit tech savvy already. The question is do you think someone my age has any chance of becoming a Data Analyst? Do you personally know of anyone who has also become a Data Analyst but around my age? Thank you I really appreciate it.
K0-8G3DgjA4,"I wish people (higher management at large corpo including) would :
a) be smart enough

K0-8G3DgjA4,"Starting a data analyst job and I know nothing about the field. So thanks for this video.

I have a lot of experience that happens to suit being a data analyst which is why I got the job (computer science and being a professional software engineer and having studied psychology and being good at statistics)."
K0-8G3DgjA4,How would u learn and practice tableau since it requires subscription and pretty expensive
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Excellent video, very helpful tips.

K0-8G3DgjA4,"Thank you, Amnesia Alex, for this very insightful video. I graduated with a Computer Science degree in 1998 but never worked in a programming position. Today, as I become a Trainer, I realise that Data Analytics is one of the hottest things out there and I'm starting to learn those tools. Appreciate your great advice!"
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Just signed up on Analyst Builder and I love it so far. I can't purchase anything yet, but I will eventually. I love how you can solve each question with multiple tools! So awesome."
K0-8G3DgjA4,25 october 2024 first time here ❤
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Great video Alex, im just starting out learning excel, how much excel would you recommend to learn for entry level positions?
for example things like charts, pivot tables, SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, dashboards, descriptive statistics and conditional formatting and applying these to a project, Is this enough excel to learn?"
K0-8G3DgjA4,What do you think about Google Data Analytics? It's a 6-month program you get a certificate for it. I was thinking of doing this because I have my billing and coding degree and even a bachelor's degree. I just want something that I could use to work from home.
K0-8G3DgjA4,why music ?
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Thanks for this, Alex!"
K0-8G3DgjA4,"How do you know which course to choose on use on udemy and coursera there are sooo many that I don’t know what is the right one to do, can anyone assist please? You search tableau for example and loads of videos on tableau appear"
K0-8G3DgjA4,Wonderful n thank you very much
K0-8G3DgjA4,Man everyone in my country want to be a Data Analyst.😂😂
K0-8G3DgjA4,"I am doing something wrong for sure. I have very good knowledge in sql, microsoft data analysts certification in power bi, tableau certification, plus more and can’t get an interview as They ask for experience. I will create a portfolio for sure."
K0-8G3DgjA4,How does all of that take you only two months 😢
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Question. So I’ve been learning how to become a data analyst. I’ve been building reports on Looker Studio with Google Sheets in my job (I’m just an admin so this is not part of my role but I’ve been given freedom to work on this and implement it) - my question is, how do I build a portfolio when everything I work on is confidential and can’t be shared due to GDPR?"
K0-8G3DgjA4,I’m looking to change my career from human services to data analyst.
K0-8G3DgjA4,Can anyone tell me how do we find the project to do? Do we have to enroll in any course or how?
K0-8G3DgjA4,"This is my first time adding a comment on a YT video. 

Reasons I aded:
1. Shows how much this video has inspired me considering the fact that I'd want to switch to something I Love

2. This will mark the start of a new chapter to me professionally and this comment will always remind me of this day I made this decision of starting this chapter 8:36 

I will come back later[probably after 1year] to give feedback

3. Lastly, to tell enyone else who's into this to not be afraid and persue what they like. It will always pay

Be blessed my fellow worldlings🎉❤

All will be well"
K0-8G3DgjA4,very interested video!
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Took step 1,  reaserched what a data analyst does, realised they potentially  make good money, that's all i need to know"

K0-8G3DgjA4,I have watched a PLETHORA of videos on this because ive been so nervous to just take the leap and your video has really encouraged me to just go for it. Go all in. The worst that ill happen is i find its really not for me or cannot find a job in this field. I will be utilizing your videos for my learning. Thanks so much!
K0-8G3DgjA4,Alex The Anal-yst
K0-8G3DgjA4,p2p lab? respect
K0-8G3DgjA4,"I need team, if you are currently studying on data analysis you comment under my post, so that we can share ideas together and help each other grow"
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Starting today! I hope to come back here in 6months to say I DID IT!!!!

Thank you Alex! 🙏"
K0-8G3DgjA4,This is great Information. You explain things very well. I have just subscribed to your channel. Thank You.👍
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Hii sir, Which AI course should i take for data analytics?"
K0-8G3DgjA4,I can't download the latest version of my SQL on my computer. I don't know where it is a problem. Can you help me please 🥺 🙏
K0-8G3DgjA4,I did not find any course for Sql on analyst builder? What should I go for to start?? SQL or Mysql is same???
K0-8G3DgjA4,what a perfect time to watch this video
K0-8G3DgjA4,"I changed my career (started) in 6 months. Though I think I was lucky. 

I went through an intense one month bootcamp (SQL, powerBI, Python). This gave me starting skills and knowledge what should I still need to learn. Then found another course online (which I still am trying to finish). 
Job hunting was long enough. I had some consultations with specialist in that, which lead me to create a better resume and gave me more knowledge about LinkedIn. 

Whilst I found my job online (not on LinkedIN), therefore I advise to find other job hunting resources not only using LinkedIN. 

Now I am using python mostly. Therefore I understand that I should try to learn more about SQL and excel (I was thinking that you are born with skills in excel, but experience shows different 😂). 

My advice in this journey is be ready (allocate your financial resources). Think about your timing, check the job market, try to find tendencies when the recruites post more jobs that you want. 
Never stop learning."
K0-8G3DgjA4,"I just started my journey,,i need a partner that we can learn and build together."
K0-8G3DgjA4,"HI Alex,
Great video!
Just wanted to ask one thing that is it okay to mention or show guided projects on a resume or portfolio?"
K0-8G3DgjA4,"Thank you, Alex. Lots of clarity here."
K0-8G3DgjA4,"I just thought before my specialization on big data analysis for my masters I will just start my journey with it but I was lost didn't know from where to start but your video inspired me ,guide me, teach me a lot . In YouTube have tons of video about it but your videos are different than any other. Thank you very much sharing us such kind of video.🥀"

K0-8G3DgjA4,thanks for sharing this knowlegde <3
K0-8G3DgjA4,Do data analysts need to be onsite or can they work remote? And what are the options for someone from outside of the US looking to apply for a position?
K0-8G3DgjA4,But Amnesia Alex will forget everything right after he study it😂
K0-8G3DgjA4,Please can you give an advice for someone who wants to become a marketing analyst

ZnAydTqCtFU,"Completed the beginner series under 4 hours, wonderful and so easy! Thanks Alex!!!"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Congratulations to me🤣🤣🤣 Beginner level completed, For SQL the LIMIT will not work just have to use the TOP n or OFFSET xFETCH y"
ZnAydTqCtFU,I’m done with beginner tutorial ✅
ZnAydTqCtFU,"One course in the bag came here cause of sql and prisma database in next.js, guess I'll be sticking around a bit"

Thanks"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Finally Love this beginner series and the magical thing is that all the concepts are crystal clear and ready to move forward .

ZnAydTqCtFU,"Sir, Thanks a lot for This Amazing Lecture 😊
Lecture - 6 Completed ✅ in MySQL for Beginners 🛢"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"It's just crazy how the first video of the Bootcamp has 1.7M views and this eighth video only has 105k views.
People quit. You, reading this, Do not be a quitter! Let's learn all the way till the last video. Discipline will pay off!
Keep going! Congrats for making it this far, but don't stop!"
ZnAydTqCtFU,just facing a problem at 03:05 and don't work out for me
ZnAydTqCtFU,WOW! I learned more here than from the entire SQL Course in the Google Data analytics cert
ZnAydTqCtFU,Thank you for breaking this down.
ZnAydTqCtFU,Should I do you SQL course after finishing the SQL series? or Just head into it as im learning with you?
ZnAydTqCtFU,and i also started watching your DA bootcamp
ZnAydTqCtFU,your explanation is quite good as i watched a sql complete course at yt but now my little little concepts are clear ;)
ZnAydTqCtFU,Nice
ZnAydTqCtFU,Your way of explaining things is like a breath of fresh air compared to the way other instructors assume you already know what they are teaching. Thank you so much!
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Hello, Done, thank you so much."
ZnAydTqCtFU,Rocking this while I also do the Google Data Analyst cert!
ZnAydTqCtFU,thank you very much
ZnAydTqCtFU,Thanks Alex
ZnAydTqCtFU,Great Course !
ZnAydTqCtFU,✅complete
ZnAydTqCtFU,Completed the beginner series. Alex thankyou so much. Feels like a huge accomplishment. 🙏
ZnAydTqCtFU,done
ZnAydTqCtFU,Thank you sir :)
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Hey Alex! I'm new to this channel and soo far I'm really enjoying your teaching procedure,but can you add some assignments to practice after each lesson as well? It will really help us."
ZnAydTqCtFU,"limit does not work in MS SQL. Do you think, why? What do you prefer, TOP statement?"
ZnAydTqCtFU,I wish there was a way to test what we learned with assignments for free for these
ZnAydTqCtFU,"1:24 I don't get that, what happened after using limit 2,1
what does it mean??"
ZnAydTqCtFU,You are an amazing person
ZnAydTqCtFU,Why does Deputy Director Leslie Knope makes more than Director Ron Swanson?
ZnAydTqCtFU,"SELECT TOP 3 *
FROM employee_demographics

TRY THIS IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEM WITH LIMIT :)"
ZnAydTqCtFU,The beginners SQL course is not enough for most business activities
ZnAydTqCtFU,"- LIMIT 3,2 como funciona?

El primer numero el 3 omitira los 3 primeros resultados y me dara solo los dos siguientes"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Thank you Alex, I had knowledge of SQL but not application. I binged the MySQL basics"
ZnAydTqCtFU,Should I go through the beginner series a couple extra times before I move on? it feels too quick for someone like me with zero previous knowledge.
ZnAydTqCtFU,I love you man
ZnAydTqCtFU,Sir this course is on point  i can imagine  your premium courses.
ZnAydTqCtFU,"3:10 the example is not clear, how average age and less than 40? I also did not understand where did the females go, disappearing from the output? Please explain. This GROUP BY is driving me crazy."
ZnAydTqCtFU,"the limit 2,1 is not working in postgresql.............ERROR:  LIMIT #,# syntax is not supported
LINE 15: limit 2,1;
         ^
HINT:  Use separate LIMIT and OFFSET clauses. .................the following is the error........is it a postgresql issue?????"
ZnAydTqCtFU,If you give assignment questions and answers on each topic it will be very helpful for us to practice
ZnAydTqCtFU,everytime I hear the outro I feel like I accomplished something
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Hey Alex, I want to ask something, If we can find the oldest, how about if we need the top 3 oldest and the top 3 youngest person in one table? hope you notice my question. thank you!"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Great refresher on both LIMIT and ALIASING.  For example, I don't think I've ever come across the whole ""limit a certain number of rows"" THEN ""return the NEXT row"" technique before.  Wow, I knew I had a lot to learn and, in some cases, relearn...  Good thing you have the Intermediate & Advanced lessons ready for me when I get there.  Keep this up and you're going to get a Christmas card!  Cheers "
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Amazing, Thank u so much Sir ALEX"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"If you are going to use MYSQL then why did you let us install SSMS, The limit clause doesn't work in SQL server."
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Comment for algorithm, thanks for sharing!"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Hi, I have a question-
Is having clause executed before SELECT? If yes, how does aliasing works in the example you showed in the video? Thanks"
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Thank You alot, when should we expect the playlist for the intermediate and advanced for mysql"
ZnAydTqCtFU,Amazing! I have learnt a lot in such a short period of time and I am confident in the prospect of working on projects!
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Hey Alex thanks a lot for making SQL easy for us.
I have a question Alex, when are you going to make videos on Intermediate and Advanced series on MySQL. And any projects on MySQL??"
ZnAydTqCtFU,Thank you this course helped me realy
ZnAydTqCtFU,Thank you so much Alex it is helpful. Sorry Alex I have a question regarding the Bootcamp course I have started taking course do I have to complete all courses to get the certification of completion thank you in advance
ZnAydTqCtFU,Can you extend your code 20% off. I thought it was on your website but i couldnt find it on which video it was on
ZnAydTqCtFU,I am enjoying learning this course  ok here so far 😊😊 but I am sorry Alex I currently can’t afford it on analyst builder 😢
ZnAydTqCtFU,So why mysql vs mssql?
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Select top 5 = limit 5? 
By the way, HAVING is in your intermediate level, as far as I remember."
ZnAydTqCtFU,Make a video on statistics for data analysis
ZnAydTqCtFU,"Aliasing is one of the best methods to reduce keystrokes!!

This is perfect 🎉❤"

XD1ul5fpnGI,How long would you say it takes to complete the roadmap?
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Alex Love from India ❤ 
Tell me the roadmap to become a data analyst from scratch..  i am getting confused by seeing multiple video's but none of them helped"
XD1ul5fpnGI,It is taking a long time for me to log in :(

 i requesting you to make same as for Excel and power BI"
XD1ul5fpnGI,Amazing platform! Good Job! Some suggestions… maybe you should think to add a course more focus on business analytics and another one about soft skills… Thank you for the platform!!!
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hi Alex sir ,
I am under graduate in computer science and doing my masters in data science i am very bad in programming and understanding it but by watching your videos that made me easy to understand develop through and this analyst builder is very great and helpful for me. I will definitely use this very well. 
thank you sir.
and if i want contact you is it possible...."

XD1ul5fpnGI,What a perfect platform Alex.. you are the super star of Data Analytics 🎉 Thank you so much and keep it up
XD1ul5fpnGI,Need a course on Power BI
XD1ul5fpnGI,Thanks and always
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Alex, thank you so much for the lifetime membership option.  I have hope that this option will pay for itself considering the rapid growth and development in Data Analytics in the years to come."
XD1ul5fpnGI,AB20OFF
XD1ul5fpnGI,"I was going to buy a course on Udemy, but Alex has put together a very nice learning platform. If I weren't so broke, I'd pay for his lifetime plan; but for now and until I can afford it, his free playlist is helping me a lot. 
I very much appreciate you for what you do to help us, help ME be a better man."
XD1ul5fpnGI,What a Chad.
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hi there Sir Alex, thank you so much for this wonderful channel that you have created, really a great help for me.."
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hello Alex, the new Analyst Builder and everything it includes is incredible. It's amazing.

I wanted to ask you, if we want to start preparing for a data analyst role from scratch, can we still do your data analyst bootcamp in the order of your videos?

That is, what you teach in your YouTube data analyst bootcamp, can we also learn it within Analyst Builder in a certain order?

Your bootcamp with the 2023 content looks very comprehensive to get started. Does this bootcamp have exercises to practice like Analyst Builder? Or can we complement the data analyst bootcamp with Analyst Builder?

I'm asking so I don't get sidetracked.

Thank you very much Alex,

you have done a tremendous job,

congratulations!"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"For a beginner, what is the order of the courses that you should do?"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"The certificates and badges, are those only available for subscribers? Like, I couldn't buy the lifetime access and still earn certs and badges, could I? Regardless, I'm going in in this, this is sick, goodbye coursera, It's 2 AM and I'm absolutely losing it right now. I'm so excited."
XD1ul5fpnGI,"This is dope and I can’t wait to get started. One question, did your pricing model change recently?"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hi Alex, I have no degree in computer science and I want to kickstart my journey into data analysis. Can you recommend any beginner course that’d teach me all I need to know and would possibly land me a great job"
XD1ul5fpnGI,I just started transitioning from post career to Data Analysis two weeks ago and  I stumbled on to your Bootcamp series just when I questioning my decision. Now I just found this video and I am literally crying with so much gratitude for this builder platform. Thank you so much for being such a great tutor and mentor!!!
XD1ul5fpnGI,Ive started the datacamp course in response to umedey and having issue with downloading Mysql to my desktop. Needed alternative way to learn.  Should I take this course after I finish the datacamp or follow up with your YouTube bootcamp course. I am trying to figure out the best path to go on as I am starting our
XD1ul5fpnGI,Great videos. Any discount code as of right now?
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Great Job Alex,you are Amaizing ,I would like to suggest if possible that you link Analyst builder to recruitment agencies so that they can source employees directly from the Analyst Builder"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"I am really grateful to this website. I have been exploring questions for a while now and I must comment that these questions are really different and thier difficulty level perfectly fit well unlike other platforms that suggest a few questions purely on SELECT. The interface is also cool. Just a suggestion, would you mind adding, monthly badges to practitioners who follow solve questions daily on the site? Thank you."
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hello, 

Let me just take a chance to drop this comment here expressing how am really grateful for what you did with the analyst builder platform. I have been using it for the last three days and it has really improved my learning.

As a data analyst here in Africa, I am not in a position to afford the courses but the Free questions have really added value to me.

The fact that one can practice the questions under different platforms ( python or SQL ) is so amazing, need I mention the responsive and on-platform code environment?

This is a very practical way of learning since the questions are set in real life scenarios.

Thank you so much for this."
XD1ul5fpnGI,"When does the Tableau course come out ?, I am so glad to have found these courses 😀"
XD1ul5fpnGI,Is the Certification is acceptable in company ?
XD1ul5fpnGI,Do u update your courses when there is updates?
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Congrats, hope for more tutorials to come. Bless you for your guidance."
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hey Alex, I am considering analyst builder but unsure how best to utilize the website, I have a Computer Science Bachelors degree that I achieved in May '22, but since graduating I have been working in non-technical roles and I feel like my skills have atrophied. I really want to get back into tech,specifically as an Analyst. I've coded in SQL, Python, and used Excel, though I have little-to-no experience in BI tools. Would I be better off focusing on solving the technical questions and working on portfolio projects on my own, or using the course feature on Analyst Builder? Keep up the great work!"
XD1ul5fpnGI,I’ve been watching you forever and have to say how proud we are to see your growth! Congrats 🎉
XD1ul5fpnGI,This is amazing Alex!
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Wow. This is really amazing and helpful! Congratulations Alex, you are awesome!"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hello am following your bootcamp sir but got stocked at installing the sql server it's showing me "" A required file could not be downloaded. This could mean the version of the installer is no longer supported."" How do I go about this please"
XD1ul5fpnGI,Looking forward to the Excel courses. 😅Im a total beginner
XD1ul5fpnGI,"To pass a job interview, what level should the user be comfortable with? Please advise. Thank you.  :)"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"I did my undergrad in Computer Engineering Technology (CET) and hated it. I graduated online during Covid without much going for me and felt really stuck. I hated working with wires and circuits but realized I was pretty good at dealing with data related assignments. After doing some research it came down to Technical Writing or Data Analytics. Later on I found your videos and thought ""Wow this guy basically made a data analysis playlist for dummies because I actually understand what's going on"". I completed the Google Data Analytics certificate and was proud of the accomplishment but knew I needed to focus on some skills and build my portfolio. Now you go ahead and bless us with Analyst Builder?!?!?! Thank you Alex.... thank you."
XD1ul5fpnGI,"This is indeed great! Especially price-wise, very affordable for starters. Thanks, Alex! I'll finish up your YouTube Bootcamp and descend on the questions on Analyst builder"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Congrats Alex, may I ask where can I use the promo code because I couldn't find any promo code bar when I checked out"
XD1ul5fpnGI,Super congrats Alex. I bought the lifetime membership. I know that someone like you will always be evolving the site. Your passion for data analysts is unmatched. I thank you for making this.
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Thank you Alex for the great work you put in rolling out  this  website , I just wanted to ask bcos have gone through the website and I couldn't find excel among the courses for  one who choose to follow  this path way or if there is a need for one to have some kind of perquisites before he or she can enrole into the program"
XD1ul5fpnGI,Thank you so much Alex❤ it's really helpful love from India🇮🇳
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hey Alex, I'm  a student, I missed out on the discount. I'm looking to buy two courses and was hoping for a discount. I don't have extra money. Thanks!"
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hi , i would like to learn about data analytics , any courses for beginners.  Any information  would be greatly appreciated"
XD1ul5fpnGI,I'm still 😕 confuse
XD1ul5fpnGI,👍 Amazing platform! It could def become the Duolingo of Data Analytics. The leaderboard works really well with that
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hey Alex, I'm in a unique situation and some guidance would be great. I have a job as a pricing analyst and have been there for about 9 months, with no prior analyst experience besides a boot camp. However, I've mostly been stuck doing data entry and issue resolution with a side of technical things like using SQL queries and Python scripting. Long story short, I have a new boss who is expecting me to actually be an analyst, and I'm finding it really tough to learn on the job. Do you have any suggestions on how to get up to speed quickly to meet his expectations? I'd say my technical skills are adequate, but the soft skills that make an analyst aren't as easy to pick up through courses and tutorials."
XD1ul5fpnGI,keeeeeeeep goiiinnnnnnnnnng
XD1ul5fpnGI,I'm waiting for the roadmap. Please Release soon
XD1ul5fpnGI,I’ve been kicking the tires on your AB site. I like it a lot. I’m going to buy the lifetime subscription in two weeks when the holidays are over. Your site is a game changer as far as learning data analytics. #salute
XD1ul5fpnGI,Congratulations Alex. I just came across your platform
XD1ul5fpnGI,"🎉 Congratulations Alex 🎉
Waw.  I can't believe you creating something that we data analyst needed. Thank you Alex."
XD1ul5fpnGI,Can you please make a video of the recession effects on data analytics job. If there is any depletion in the entry level roles or the demand for entry level data analyst is increasing in US. It will be a great help for me and a lot of people who want to get into data analytics. Thanks!
XD1ul5fpnGI,"Hello sir
Dell Vostro 5630 i5 1340p vs dell Inspiron 5630 i5 1340p which one is best for data analytics and data science 😢"

XD1ul5fpnGI,"There is no mssql course
Is it coming soon or should I go ahead with MySQL?"

XD1ul5fpnGI,"Congrats Alex!! 👍 
I've seen your videos and there're great. Thanks for sharing this platform that I'm sure you'll do just fine."

Everything looks so great otherwise."

kifhSqep9UM,I was looking for the code but i couldnt find it until now. Any chance you can extend it?
kifhSqep9UM,Just got the lifetime
kifhSqep9UM,"Sorry I had a question I’m very interested in buying the life time but I just wanted to know if this is just a way to boost your knowledge for people that are already in data analytics? Or is it more of a course where if you do everything and finish, it would help you land your first entry level job?"
kifhSqep9UM,3:05:16
kifhSqep9UM,I missed the livestream but have been loving Analyst Builder to learn SQL!
kifhSqep9UM,please tel me discount will be there for a while
kifhSqep9UM,I can’t wait to watch this!
kifhSqep9UM,"Hi Alex,

I just explored the Analyst Builder, and it's a fantastic one-stop-shop for aspiring data analysts like myself. I noticed you've listed a few certifications that are worth pursuing. I recently obtained the CompTIA Data+ certification and am curious whether it falls into the '95% completely useless' or 'actually worth getting' category. 😂 I'd appreciate your honest opinion on this. 😃"
kifhSqep9UM,Thanks a lot for this Sir.
kifhSqep9UM,Hey Alex Thanks for this.

Group by district

dCNjUOc1cBY,HELPFUL.
dCNjUOc1cBY,"As little as I use HAVING since once you start using CTE's an Temp Tables you can just always filter on the WHERE,  this is one of the most common questions that's always asked in SQL job interviews especially if there is some sort of technical test."
dCNjUOc1cBY,"Hi, I'm trying to transition to data analytics from engineering. Apparent obstacle is that i don't have experience in data. I know that I should learn SQL. Is there any certificate that I can do to proove i'm proficient wioth SQL to future employeers? Thanks"

dCNjUOc1cBY,is this series going to replace whats in your bootcamp series?
dCNjUOc1cBY,First. 👀
lEjmgE-hogg,"Excel is deduction, not induction. Start with individual examples and link them to fundamental principles, rather than starting with fundamentals and extrapolate to individual cases. The same thing about Sherlock Holmes. He did everything backwards, and virtually nobody is a genius like that. Deduction is tiresome."
lEjmgE-hogg,Finally someone mentioned excel is⚔️⚔️
lEjmgE-hogg,"I might make a thousand bucks from the amount of times you mentioned ""excel""😂😂"
lEjmgE-hogg,I might make a 1000 bucks from the amount of times you mentioned excel😂😂
lEjmgE-hogg,"It’s also amazing how little excel people actually know, like I got an internship and learned more in 2 weeks than they have in decades"
lEjmgE-hogg,100% on point 👍🏾
lEjmgE-hogg,Excel is excellent tool and I love using it
lEjmgE-hogg,"I Laughed so hard watch this, nothing in this life is easy, especially for newbies like me, God help us All."
lEjmgE-hogg,"I was tasked with creating and formatting Billing Details spreadsheets for all our customer accounts. The starting point was multiple CSV and Excel documents. I used Python with Pandas and OpenPyXL. I'd consider this more Report Automation then Data Analysis. But I do use some of the scripting to create other reporting based on at the moment needs. Great thing about doing reporting this way is I can save the scripts and at a later time rerun it using current data sets.
Excel can be used as the ending point of the automation and analysis to provide the results to non-developer / non-analyst users."
lEjmgE-hogg,So Please what is your recommendation for data analysis
qxj3dx0c7RM,"Hello Alex, from Ethiopia Africa"
qxj3dx0c7RM,"Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the CareerFoundry webinar on mistakes to avoid when searching for a data analytics job:

Introduction

- William from CareerFoundry welcomes attendees to a webinar on career mistakes and planning a Q&A session
- The topic is avoiding mistakes in a data analytics job search, covered in a video by Alex the Analyst 
- Alex is a CEO and consultant with extensive global work experience 

Mistake 1 - Not Networking Enough

- Networking uncovers unadvertised opportunities and long-term connections
- Can validate skills, gain advice, and showcase abilities to industry professionals  
- Critical for mentorship, prospects, career growth especially early on

Mistake 2 - Using a Generic Resume

- Tailor resumes to each application - match skills to role needs 
- Avoid spraying resume everywhere regardless of fit
- Customizing gets higher application-to-interview conversion  

Mistake 3 - No Portfolio Projects  

- Portfolios verify and demonstrate resume skills  
- Provide interview talking points on process and insights
- SQL scripts alone are good but full projects are better 

Mistake 4 - Limited Company Research
- Learn about the company's data and business model
- Helps conversationally and tailoring responses during interviews
- Ask questions at the end to show initiative 

Mistake 5 - Not Checking Company Culture  
- Research culture and employee satisfaction beyond the interview 
- One company portrayed positive culture but had terrible reviews  

Mistake 6 - Accepting the Wrong Job
- Ensure alignment with position responsibilities 
- Consider work-life balance, commute, etc. in decision making

Mistake 7 - Isolating Yourself 

- Leverage networking platforms like LinkedIn to connect
- Be selective with recruiters due to risk of fake companies
- Recruiters simplify the job search process 

Additional Tips:

- Blend hard and soft skills - both critical to get hired
- Show transferable skills from other industries  
- Persistently apply leveraging all resources as a new grad
- AI enables vs. replaces data analytics jobs - learn alongside 
- Continue developing core data skills that remain in-demand
- Prepare thoroughly for an active hiring period in 2024"

zgYqUP_PhQo,GROUP BY has been a head scratcher up until now... Thank you Alex!
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Heyy, how do you do your mouse pointer like that"
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Hi,what is the difference between yours free and paid course? I am from non IT and want to become DATA ANALYST,guide me.Thank you ."
zgYqUP_PhQo,done
zgYqUP_PhQo,I am starting my data analysis learning today and I will come back to give some progress report later.
zgYqUP_PhQo,"can someone help me with the order thing because i didn't get it because i didn't get what is the diffrance between gender, age and age, gender thing he did"
zgYqUP_PhQo,Alex I can tell is 'too kool' especially from hearing the genre of music he has for his channel! I just earned my Google Analytics certificate and am diving into data analytics. Big thanks to Alex for everything he’s doing—a truly intelligent individual. God bless you in everything you do!
zgYqUP_PhQo,cool
zgYqUP_PhQo,You are great teacher Alex. 😇
zgYqUP_PhQo,Is there a place with practice questions related to this concept?
zgYqUP_PhQo,DISTINCT is same as GROUP BY?
zgYqUP_PhQo,The group by clause finally makes sense! Thank you so much for this tutorial and also for switching to MySQL 👏🏻
zgYqUP_PhQo,please  I'm having issues with my query ...i did exactly like u did in the video 1:09 where my SELECT clause was gender and my GROUP BY was also gender but the synatx is saying error in mysql
zgYqUP_PhQo,Thanks Alex for all your hard work! This tutorial was very easy to follow and understand. I appreciate you going over the small simple details within the function.
zgYqUP_PhQo,Thank you for the best classes
zgYqUP_PhQo,I am having problems accessing the downloaded SQL for my practice
zgYqUP_PhQo,"The lesson is about:
1. The use of ""Group By"" and ""Order By""
2. The use of AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT()"
zgYqUP_PhQo,very helpful
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Alex, thank you so much ❤❤"
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Hi Alex, Thank you for this awesome video. Can we add this project in resume? if yes, how can we add. Please help me."
zgYqUP_PhQo,great video thanks
zgYqUP_PhQo,tnx sir
zgYqUP_PhQo,"- [00:00]  📊 Group By in MySQL groups rows with the same values in specified columns and allows running aggregate functions on them.
- [02:13] 📈 Aggregate functions like AVG, MAX, MIN, and COUNT can be used with Group By to calculate statistics for grouped rows.
- [05:51] 🔄 Order By sorts the result set in ascending or descending order based on specified columns.
- [07:40] 🎯 Multiple columns can be used for sorting with Order By, allowing hierarchical sorting based on specified column order.
- [09:04] ⚠ Using column positions instead of names in Order By is possible but not recommended due to potential issues with column changes."
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Alex, this series on MySQL is really polished, no hiccups at all.  Also appreciate your GitHub repository where I can also follow along with your SQL files.  It's great to see SQL syntax that just works the way it is supposed to.  I also appreciate the occasional ""best practice"" you share (i.e. Normally using proper column names in the GROUP BY clause vice column numbers, etc.)  Working smart, not hard ALWAYS appeals to my brain.  Thanks again for the awesome content!  😉"
zgYqUP_PhQo,@3:15 You select from employee_salary and group by gender. employee_salary does not have a gender column. I could not get it to work due to the group by request. I also used the select * as you did. The select * would only apply to the employee_salary and not the entire DB since you specified from that table.
zgYqUP_PhQo,What happened? Last night I started this bootcamp using SQL Server and today all SQL videos are explained using MySQL
zgYqUP_PhQo,Fantastic cvid
zgYqUP_PhQo,This was very helpful! Thank you so much!
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Also there doesn't seem to be a way to purchase 1 course at one time, it appears that we have to choose a bundle"
zgYqUP_PhQo,"I love this tutorial, crystal clear, useful examples, straight to the point!"
zgYqUP_PhQo,loving the lessons. Waiting for the rest.
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Thank you Alex. 
I Just started learning data analytics with your bootcamp playlist and currently I am a little bit confused whether I continue learning the SQL part or jump to excel part and at the same time keep following this MySQL serie. I'm thinking about doing it all because I'm still a rookie and I have to learn.
I will be happy to hear your suggestion.
And thank you once again Alex for you content."
zgYqUP_PhQo,Thank u sooo much alex for this video
zgYqUP_PhQo,Alex create a video on how sql is benefitted for hr's am messaging for a second time
zgYqUP_PhQo,thanks Alex for the good tutorial . where can we get the csv data you have used ?
zgYqUP_PhQo,Free Palestine 🇵🇸 boycott brands supporting the genocide
zgYqUP_PhQo,"Alex, hello! 🚀 I wanted to be the first to comment and say how much I appreciate all of the amazing content you make! 🙌 Your ability to analyze things is impressive. I would adore the chance to collaborate with you and add to your wonderful projects. I am sure that I can contribute useful expertise.

MARn_mssG4A,Day2✅
MARn_mssG4A,"Thank you Mr Alex,it has been so insightful so far, more to go."
MARn_mssG4A,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 5 / 84  ( WHERE Clause, Comparative and Logical Operations, Isolated conditions, Like Statements)"
MARn_mssG4A,im still not sure why you would use parenthesis tbh
MARn_mssG4A,"Hi, Alex! I have a question about 5:17, in the query you have written .... AND gender = 'male'. Before running this query, I have tried to guess the result and thought that it will be no output, because gender values starts with capital letter, and when we write gender = 'male' it must not find such a suitable value. My question is that does mysql behave case-insensitive in these cases?"
MARn_mssG4A,"If anyone wants to know why there's a row containing the null value, well, it's not an actual row in the database. It's a placeholder row added by MySQL Workbench for manual data entry you will notice  you can click on it and type values if you are in result grid view"
MARn_mssG4A,is anyone getting a row that contains all null values
MARn_mssG4A,Alex please make a video series on machine learnig and time series. something used by Bussiness Analayst and Data Scientists
MARn_mssG4A,"This is so great Alex, i started Yesterday 21st of July and am here now 22nd of July, Can you also make a video on special characters on SQL😁"
MARn_mssG4A,Hello! May I kindly ask if the information is still relevant for the year 2025?
MARn_mssG4A,"Making This Message To The Me of Now. Complete This Beginner Course By Tuesday, the 8th of JULY. Emmanuel"
MARn_mssG4A,"Started my journey on the 1st of July 2025, completed this section 4th of July ✅"
MARn_mssG4A,Ty Alex. <3
MARn_mssG4A,"We <3 u Alex, tyyyyyy"
MARn_mssG4A,"Alex is doing very good job at break everything down, easy to understand!"
MARn_mssG4A,This is great!!! I am data analyst but doing some refresh and learning new tips and tricks. Thank you for this.
MARn_mssG4A,Thank you
MARn_mssG4A,The  Best tutorial ever
MARn_mssG4A,"Lesson#5 Conclusion

1. What is Where Clause and how it works?
2. What are logical operators?
3. How to use WHERE clause along with Logical operators?
4 .What is LIKE statement?
5. How to use LIKE statement with % sign and _ underscore sign ?"
MARn_mssG4A,I am watching adverstisements on your videos as a payback maybe
MARn_mssG4A,Thank you so much for this video on WHERE clauses. Perfect pacing and very informative.
MARn_mssG4A,"At 05:22 minutes, you applied AND condition on Gender, but you wrote male instead of Male (as stored in table) and it still filtered the data how? male and Male, are two different things. MySQL is not case sensitive?"
MARn_mssG4A,"The way you explain and show everything is golden, I was so confused by a few things from a previous course and within just these first videos you already cleared my confusion. THANK YOU A BUNCH!"
MARn_mssG4A,DONE!
MARn_mssG4A,Done 3/10/25 let's keep the momentum going y'all <3
MARn_mssG4A,we can also use <> for not equal.
MARn_mssG4A,Hey Alex! Thank you so much for this tutorial. This is very helpful. God bless!
MARn_mssG4A,"You are a great teacher. I have learnt SQL before, but you make it so easy. I can't wait to learn other things. Your channel is officially my best channel. Thank you for this"
MARn_mssG4A,Done!✅
MARn_mssG4A,Tom & Jerry 😂
MARn_mssG4A,"Sir, Thanks a lot for This Amazing Lecture 😊
Lecture - 3 Completed ✅ in MySQL for Beginners 🛢"
MARn_mssG4A,The amount of patience you have to explain everything in details is amazing - teaching other people is a whole skill in and of itself! Amazing work with these tutorials!
MARn_mssG4A,"The way you teach💯💯💯
Super simplified."
MARn_mssG4A,"Thank you for this series !! I’m really understanding the lesson out of everything ! You are definitely the best person to teach ! I have no degree only some college credits, I started on my coursea journey about 2 -3 years ago (I haven’t finished the DA course yet) but I have to say this video including me learning via hands on has helped me a lot ! All the other platforms left me completely confused about the basics !!! . I can’t thank you enough for this channel ❤🎉🎉!!!! I’m motivated to keep on my journey"
MARn_mssG4A,"hi my where clause is not appearing its giving me other options like begin, EOF. Its not appearing on the keywords"
MARn_mssG4A,"Hey alex, for calculation () is fine but what is the use for string values for instance  //// where (first_name like 'Les%' and salary = 75000) or salary <=25000; /////       and without () //// where first_name like 'Les%' and salary = 75000 or salary <=25000; /////  the result is the same for both then what is use of using parentheses in the first place for strings?"
MARn_mssG4A,Thank you so much sir
MARn_mssG4A,"you need to use ""(""term"")"" only when you use ""OR"" ??"
MARn_mssG4A,"Hello, Done."
MARn_mssG4A,Keeping it consistent thank you for the lessons!
MARn_mssG4A,"mine didnt come with developers option when installing , i am windows i took full option  , now i try to run the where function but it keeps saying no database selected how do i select database"
MARn_mssG4A,The best teacher for sql tbh I’m doing the charlotte chaze cert and I feel like I understand Alex more!
MARn_mssG4A,Complete the bootcamp is one of my goals to the 1st trimester of 2025. I am focusing on landing a job as Sustainability data analyst!
MARn_mssG4A,"why it return only one row?

use parks_and_recreation;
select *
from employee_salary
where first_name = 'Ron' or 'Tom'"
MARn_mssG4A,Thanks Alex
MARn_mssG4A,Your courses are very interesting and you give much explanations. Thank you very much.
MARn_mssG4A,"Thank you!

✅complete"
MARn_mssG4A,excute statment under keyboard is not working while giving run anyone help me
MARn_mssG4A,When I do select from employee salary it gives me an error
MARn_mssG4A,2:01 bro just wanted to make a tom and jerry pun
MARn_mssG4A,"Day 2 learning and practicing about Data Analyst, Thank you Alex!!"
MARn_mssG4A,lost it at tom and jerry
MARn_mssG4A,On 7:06  shows an x on select and won’t let me press the lightning bolt. Can someone let me know what’s wrong
MARn_mssG4A,"Thanks for this Alex, wanted to ask as you mentioned if one may need to focus on the SQL part...can they claim the certificate without having to touch on the rest of the courses?"
MARn_mssG4A,done
MARn_mssG4A,this is perfect professor Alex!  Thank u thank u
MARn_mssG4A,"Can I ask a good Samaritan to explain to me what difference does it make to use parentheses?

For example, while watching this video I tried myself a similar exercise:

SELECT *
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_demographics
WHERE (first_name= 'Andy' AND age= 34) OR age = 40 

Or 

SELECT *
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_demographics
WHERE first_name= 'Andy' AND age= 34 OR age = 40 

Result was exactly the same.

I do understand what the PEMDAS rules are about, it's just I'm trying to figure out a practical use for this?


Thanks !"
MARn_mssG4A,omg alex is explaining sql much better than most university lecturer. great ! thanks!
MARn_mssG4A,Weird episode of Tom and Jerry
MARn_mssG4A,Tom & Jerry is a pleasant coincidence!
MARn_mssG4A,Alex The Analyst please I didn't understand how the data was been generated if you can help me with it
MARn_mssG4A,"12:25 I ran this query and my result shows 2 lines of Leslie, any idea why? Also, I have tried with the ; and without ;  but results are all same, showing 2 lines of Leslie."
MARn_mssG4A,"Thank you, Alex! On my journey to become a data analyst every single video you have made has been of great value."
MARn_mssG4A,Now I see why everyone talks about Alex the Analyst!
MARn_mssG4A,"Hi Alex, Thanks for your tutorial! Your videos are very helpful. You are very organized and deliver concepts clearly that are easy to follow and understand. Thank you again!"
MARn_mssG4A,"Hi Alex, first off, thanks for the terrific videos! They're incredibly helpful. I'm a math major looking to branch out and apply my skills, so I thought to start learning some basics with data analystics.

Second off - and this is a silly question but bear with me because previously to these videos I haven't even touched github - how did you get the data set you're usin gin the example? I tried searching it on github but couldn't find anything."
MARn_mssG4A,"Can we edit the data inside the compiler, if the data was  mistaken somewhere?"
MARn_mssG4A,Been very hesitant.. but watching a few of your videos made me realize it isn't that complicated. huge thanks to you Alex!
MARn_mssG4A,Aqui aprendemos a realizar busquedas filtradas
MARn_mssG4A,why it is showing a null record in the end? 4:31
MARn_mssG4A,Hey! When i am using Select two times it shows error on my second select statement. I dont know why. Can someone help???
MARn_mssG4A,"This lesson is about:
using ""Where"" to filter data. (example where column_name =  value)
using =, >=, <=, != to filter data and also using AND, OR, NOT and ().
using ""like"" to search for pattern in a text (% , _)."
MARn_mssG4A,thanks
MARn_mssG4A,"Hey Alex! 

I'm just on the 6th video but I'm really excited already for what's ahead. You teach so well.
I'll be here soon to give you my success story 😊❤🎉"
MARn_mssG4A,"Hi Alex, 
Thank you very much for your time and effort."
MARn_mssG4A,"I'll share this resourceful information on my IG and all my pages for people to find you here.... this is a well organized tutorial I never get to watch and put in practices as real class, now i have book and a pen 😂😂Thank you Alex you're amazing."
MARn_mssG4A,Trying to do the where clause but when I run it it's saying employee_salary doesn't exist
MARn_mssG4A,Thank you so much for patiently explaining everything in detail.
MARn_mssG4A,wow database is actually so so convenient and useful! i really hope to learn this
MARn_mssG4A,great thanks
MARn_mssG4A,Tom & Jerry with 50000 😍
MARn_mssG4A,"when i copy and paste  SELECT *
                                          FROM
                                          WHERE 
it does not work, can anyone help me figure out what am I doing wrong? please!"
MARn_mssG4A,"Hi Alex! You are really transforming lives with these videos as these open up so many opportunities for people like me.
Hope good things continue to come your way for doing this!"
MARn_mssG4A,"Hi Alex I'm a begginer in data analytics, I was so scared that I've wasted my money and time, but your videos are God sent,I am so grateful I found them,things are more clearer now. 
Thank you so so much for your tutorials they are a great help."
MARn_mssG4A,"Saya agak sulit memahami bahasa ingris,  kalau bisa aktifkan subtitel indonesia nya kawan.  Hal itu akan sangat membantu saya"
MARn_mssG4A,Hello Alex i am a begginner on the Data Analytics space and for me watchin this videos give me a great insight ..i am gona watch all the tutorial up until i obtain my data analytics certification.
MARn_mssG4A,"Alex, I appreciated the refresher regard the WHERE clause in MySQL.  Good to be going over this info again.  Getting the basics down solidly represents a firm foundation for future learning.  Thanks again!  👍"
MARn_mssG4A,New adhd hyper fixation 👍
MARn_mssG4A,So helpful content
MARn_mssG4A,How do I write the where clause you wrote at the top ?
MARn_mssG4A,Thank Your For Teach Us 😇
MARn_mssG4A,"Thank you Alex, so insightful cant wait to update you on the job search. Recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certification, your channel has become an incredible recourse for me to use. You're killing it man!"
MARn_mssG4A,"Great work Alex.
Really appreciate this..

However, i have been trying to get that command..""From employee demographics.""

Keeps giving me error codes.

Until I use,
From parks_and_recreation.employeedemographics.

I don't know why.
Can someone help out please"
MARn_mssG4A,"A HUGE THANK YOU ALEX!!!!!!!!! I have no words to express, thats really helpful!!!!!"
MARn_mssG4A,hi where can i find the dataset to this tutorial andsubsequent mysql tutorials pls?
MARn_mssG4A,Thanks!  Parks and Rec <3
MARn_mssG4A,I’m currently doing a Coursera certification course and it’s not at ALL as helpful for skill building as these videos. Thank you!!
MARn_mssG4A,Great 👍
MARn_mssG4A,"I have a knowledge of it, but the way you are simplifying it and touching every nitty-gritty of it is making me understand better and wanting to just delete what i had known before and stick to yours.
Thank you Alex"
MARn_mssG4A,thanks Alex for the good tutorial . where can we get the csv data you have used ?
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Garbage tool, used by people who know no better. Data limitations, prone to frequent crashes, clunky,  and all-together a pox on our society."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Just came here to find out if I hate excel for the right reasons
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel is just bullahiy horseshit shititsel hope it so
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Cant handle thousands of rows  - Yeah thats  called a database - not Excel. Excel  is for  modelling and sensitivity analysis  - If you are trying to stuff 10000 rows in a spreadsheet  - Well ....then  ...........  Try Access it comes with the suite. Excel comes with VBA and you can automate EVERYTHING - like most users they just scratch the surface - Excel is a great tool if you learn how to use it but it is not a database - Never advertised as one. Excel has a rich graphing capability but not on a par with Power BI - nor is it as fast.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Excel is absolutely trash for simple data analysis.  I spent almost 30 minutes troubleshooting and searching the internet trying to display a simple linear regression equation ( y = mx + b) from a 2 - variable chart with about 20 data points.  I never figured it out... This is one of the most BASIC, simplest things you could look for in statistics.  Huge fail."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"For Junior data Analyst, which would be better to use Excel or Google Sheets ?"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Wait, is excel cannot shared data real time? Because I did use it before.."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I work at a major Bank where I am the sole DA for a non technical team. Our monthly transaction details contains almost 1 million lines of data. Doing any filtering, pivot, or lookups will crash the damn thing. Now imagine doing it for a 12-24 month ask."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"In comparison, I will be more prefer Google Sheet. first of all it is cloud-based, i do not need to worry about forget to save problem. and the formula i feel that could more functionable than excel. for example =UNIQUE()"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Weirdly, when dealing with data sets exceeding 300,000 rows,  it's easier to take the data into the VB Editor using variant arrays and write back rows where a column contains a value rather than apply filters.  Unless you're transforming your data within the VB editor or via power-query, Excel doesn't handle large data well. It seems to me that Microsoft intend you to handle large datasets with more advanced tools.

I agree that version control is less than ideal.

Now Excel online and OneDrive are being used to work on the same spreadsheets simultaneously,  I believe Excel can actually do what Google Sheets can do---works for me anyway.

I don't think excel is designed for advanced data visualisation; however,  now they're integrating some Python so who knows what they're planning. Perhaps some kind of AI / Excel integration to help automate data visualisation. 

Whilst general programming languages offer perhaps a great variety of things to automate, VB and VBA can automate quite a lot both within excel, in windows,  and other Microsoft products. 

The question is why you would learn enough VBA or VB to develop a broader ability to automate. You would do so only if your job required it. I think most people learning to program are going to be aiming at the future jobs markets: AI, machine learning, Data analysis,  website design and virtual reality/film/video gaming applications. 

However,  what's noticable is that even very large corporations still heavily utilise excel. Often these companies lock-down their machines so most users can use VBA but not Python. I think that's the main reason VBA programmers haven't abandoned VBA altogether in favour of Python."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"If you know how to use classes, arrays, find function, dictionaries you are really fast in VBA-Excel. However you can run SQL in VBA-Excel if you like. BTW, using a powerful interface in VBA you can create dynamic SQL queries. Just selecting items from dynamically created lists based on tables, you can create SQL queries as flexible as you wish without typing the SQL query. However, you'll need to generate the SQL string query in VBA based on your rules."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I can extract 2.5k records out of 1 million records in 2.5 seconds using VBA. Just wonder if is slow. Also extract hundreds of files' names, build an array from tens of thousands based on multiple key words searches in fractions of a second. Is this slow?"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Excel is certainly the model of a love-hate relationship. 
It's super useful for very basic reporting or making PivotTable, but the minute you start using Power Query or importing data, the loading/refresh times can get out of hand, and then people who want ""that report"" do not understand how to use it. Seems like there should be a merger between PBI and Excel that brings the best of both together for those reports that require drill down and some visualizations when specifying certain metrics or criteria need to be specified. I deal with operations and logistics, so maybe my use cases are unique, but those are my gripes. LOL"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Alex can you help give us tutorials on Azure Data Studio
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Lots of talk based on 10 years ago Excel
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I'm just learning Excel and I've been getting into all the different things it can do.  Now I am interested in becoming a data analysts, and from what other data analysts have said from other videos I have seen, say Excel is a good place to start for a foundation and then move on from there like learning Sql and other data base languages.  Saw one of your videos on Sql.  Very interesting!"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel with sharepoint seems to work for version control and real-time usage.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I just feel like things go so much quicker with SQL or Python. With Excel, I feel like I have so many small steps that I have to get in order to get things done. However, on the flip side, I LOVE the visual aspect of Excel."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Excel is still the best tool to quick check something , or to write a complex query download the data and send a Pivot as a quick and dirty solution to ad-hoc request. No matter how big the company is or tools it uses there will always be 1 board member or colleague that will ask you ""can i get it in xlxl format please "". So yes it does have a limitation however this tool wont be going anywhere and what i would even suggest is learn excel to be at least  intermediate user your life as a Data Analyst or w.e Data position you will have will be easier."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Any comments on PowerBI software? Does Data Analysts love them?
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"3D stacked pie chart 😂😂

Edit: wait, tell me those don't exist please"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I still consider Power Query in excel  one of the best ETL tools for data transformation
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Haha ok. i've probably been using excel longer than you've been doing addition.  excel is fantastic for appropriate use cases . . . but its not good for everything.  btw, the visuals in excel, back in the day, were about the best you could generally find."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"When Indid not know about the existenxe of other tools, I did an analysis on Excel with a fine temporal resolution data (15 mins) and the data is for 5 years. Excel crashed severally! It boggles my mind that Microsoft is interoperating with Python, yet this limitation of Excel has not been improved upon. Is it a policy thing or what? Anyway, are putting this on LinkedIn, @Alex? I would love to see David Langet's reaction to this video. In any event, enpirically, Excel is still valued in the Data Industry. I am even going to use it now, including its data visualization 😁. Thanks for sharing your thoughts."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Ummm...I guess you never heard of Excel Online, Power Automate, Power Query, Power Bi, and Macros,huh?"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"However, most companies are still looking for Excel skills for data analytics."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,i hate excel with a passion
TGAUZQJaQbQ,What if you open this excel file with pandas in Jupiter notebook?
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Alex kindly make a video on how sql is benefited for HR's, it will be big help."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I find myself making a sheet called raw data, with all of the cleaning and wrangling being done with a copy of the data in a different sheet."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hey alex let me know how sql  benefits HR Mng.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hello sir make a video on realtime change in data automatically change in dashboard
TGAUZQJaQbQ,That pun was intended
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I used Excel when is already filtered in Sql and used tableau or power bi for visualization
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I am forced to use Excel daily because clients don't know how to use other data tools nor can I use OneDrive due to sensitive information.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Found it already 😁 thank youuu
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Hi Alex please I just came across your videos not long ago and I love it, thank you so much for doing this, I’m new to this career, just about starting. Please do you have an introduction to Excel? Cos I just saw Conditional formatting, Charts, Cleaning data and full project in Excel in your channel"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I dislike it so much, I can’t get myself to really learn it"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,They’re trying to solve some of this with the python for excel functionality. Add in power query and you might have something cool to work with. If your arm is twisted of course 😩🤣
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Python is coming to Excel. I think Excel is cool again. 😂
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Power query bro
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Ever heard of excel add-ins like power pivot and power query ? Use those if you need to work with big data also if you need more visualizations you now have python in excel.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"While I agree with your comments on large data handling and visualizations, as someone who has used excel for over 15 years, and attribute my strength in it as the primary contributing factor to the progression in my career, I strongly disagree with your statement and sentiment of ""the people who really love Excel are the people who are just getting started in Excel.""  I still love Excel, and would highly advise anyone getting into data analysis, that you have to learn it.  You also have to learn how to summarize data in SQL and other tools first, so you don't have every row in Excel filled in...the tool was not designed to be used this way, no matter how many rows/columns Microsoft put in it.  Don't hate it, learn it, and learn it well.  You WILL stand out, in a good way, if you do."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Reason #3 - it does allow for collaborative work if you save it on a Teams channel. Works relatively OK
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Didn’t even mention Python in Excel, especially around improving data viz capabilities. In terms of automation, whilst you can’t access your local machine currently , I’m sure it won’t be long before Python in Excel allows for this."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Why is everyone talking about automation in terms of VBA and not in Power Query/Power Pivot? 
As far as I know Microsoft themselves stopped supporting VBA. 
And yeah, I agree about Data Viz part but in terms of data transformations you can literally do the same stuff you can in Pandas.
Also, you are saying that Excel freezes with big amounts of data - well, because you are cooking it wrong. Load it into data model and use Power Pivot to display the aggregations you want. You don't view the whole dataframe in Python, do you? :) 
What will happen with Python if you decide to view the whole dataframe of, let's say, 1M rows and 20-30 columns by removing the limitation of dataframe display? It will either crash your Jupyter notebook or take forever to load.
I mean, I don't use Excel much but it can handle a lot more if you know how to use it and sometimes be a faster/more convenient solution than one in Python/R."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Why doesn't everyone just use Google sheets?
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"to your second point about the lack of version control, if you add  a data connection to all the data tables in your excel file and do the data transformations in power query, you actually have pretty good version control in the power query module inside of excel."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"If you are analysing large quantities of data you need a tool that can work with the data in an organised way.  MS Access springs to mind,  Excel is a problem in that the formulas are too easily changed, one by one.    It is hard to check that your spreadsheet works as you intend.  With a database you use sql to manipulate data as far as possible.  Excel to deal simply with relatively small amounts of data and present it"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I love Excel so much, I was stunned by how versatile it is when I was learning it at first. Haven't used it for a while though, I just use SQL and Python more"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Data analyst here. I feel you are unfair regarding automation. I feel that there are libraries and tools to help you automate with excel. I have found I can automate pretty much everything I need to do with excel VBA. Although it is often easier with python/pandas
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I also hate Excel, but reason 3 and 4 are wrong. There is a collaborative side to it with the subscription, and it now supports Python."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,My son feels the same. He handles gigabytes of data in his job in telecoms and he gets super stressed with its data limitations. While he can do queries from Redshift clients still want excel.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"You are absolutely correct.  Excel's small learning curve makes it a favorite, but by no means is Excel a one size fits all tool.  I have seen billion-dollar companies being run on Excel, and the accounting dept drowning in spreadsheets, crazy."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I get fairly large data pulls at my work, and for some reason (security?) they will only write them in encrypted xlsx files that end up being several GB in size. This leads to my question - do you do much with xlwings for Python? I've used this library to write macros and extract data from excel, and I very much prefer it to VBA."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"""Death to spreadsheets"" was part of my work email signature at some point. I got told off a bit, so in retaliation I upgraded it to ""Death to Excel"". 😝

(Fortunately, I get away with a lot of stuff)"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Get a Mac. Version control is built right into the OS.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Fax… lol
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Hey Alex! I definitely don’t hate excel, I understand your points but I disagree. 

(1) large data size, yes this is a fair point above 1 million rows + it becomes pretty unusable. There are potential workarounds though with tools like powerquery but yes I agree at this point it makes sense to use a different tool or excel combined with some other tools like Python dataframes.

(2) Version control so this is part of google sheets. For excel files if saved in share point or onedrive you can do that. 

(3) again collaboration is possible if you use excel online with share point or onedrive

(4) VBA I agree their are limitations but it still is a powerful tool I have made UI, games, Monte Carlo simulations, and many powerful automations with VBA.

(5) I think excels data visualization is great for what is needed. What you mentioned is basically a big part of why power bi exists.

Anyway imo excel is amazing people should get better at Excel and it should be part of any data analysts skillset. Like anything it’s a tool that works best combined with Python, power query, SQL, and powerbi knowledge."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Didja consider keeping your source data in a separate file, just in case something went wrong in Excel?
That's what we learned in the old days. Do your own damned version control.
They like to tell you Excel can do everything, but obviously, it can't.
Did they ever fix that rounding error that raised such a stink around the turn of the millennium?
You mentioned Google Sheets. There ARE alternate spreadsheet tools out there, some that will do things Excel just can't. But how many different tools do you want to have to learn?
Yeah, it's the lingua franca out there, like Python is. But that does NOT mean they're the best available tools, especially for a particular job. Say, I hear you can now script Excel with Python. Do you think that will really help?"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"hahahaha, Filters! the first thing that popped into  my mind"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Those are all good points. I haven’t had the version problem luckily.  Most people I know love it because they don’t do anything highly complicated.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Yeah people who only use things like Excel and PowerB are insane. R is king for data analytics. Some specific stuff Python is better for, but R is really just the meat and bones of  analysis and visualisation."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Maybe it's just a problem I've had but I cannot seem to get excel to do a simple count distinct in a pivot table either 😂
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Your points have merit, but as a Excel/Microsoft fan boy I have to disagree! But that is just me. 😁😁"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"""Data limitation and performance issues"" -- hear, hear!"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"As we say in England, horses for courses. Excel is great for some tasks, not so great for others. I've been working with companies ranging from 5 employees right up to 30,000 employees. The only thing common between them was that every single person had access to Excel. It's everywhere, and that alone makes it invaluable. If you only work in a tech/data department, great! Use python, Sql, wahtever you want and whatever is available. As soon as you have to work with ""non-data"" people, you're screwed. Chances are, they are still going to be somewhat familiar with Excel. If they need more than a simple dashboard, that's the way to go."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I really bust out laughing 😆. I can relate a lot to the first reason 🤣 the excel will take hours to open and will just crash. Power Bi my new lover 😍
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I am one of the people who dislike Excel
TGAUZQJaQbQ,You're making this with Excel on personal level. XD
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"So, I bought a (local - Brazilian) program to become a Data Scientist and it doesn't really teach Excel - they go straight to Python, so why bother?

The fact of my first dashboard ever was done on Streamlit was cool and all, but I decided to learn Power BI on my own and it felt like a burden sometimes. Then, a lot of job descriptions ask for Excel - and it looks worse than Power BI. I get it, if you don't know how to SQL/Python and the dataset is minimal, it works. However, I'm either Google Sheets (online collab works and it's free enough) or Python/SQL. 

People are asking Rocket Science questions on interviews for a junior position - if the industry is that demanding, they should have dropped Excel a long time ago.

But that's not the world we live in. Every single beginner on data should start on Excel/Power BI to slap it on the resume before knowing better (yes, including Data Science, on which Excel and Power BI don't really belong - except they do on job requirements). Because learning them after you know better is mildly painful. 

Tl,dr: Most other things are ""Python results, but bad"". Except R, but ""we don't talk about R..."""
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Excel freezes when you have to analyse a whole bunch of data set...😢
TGAUZQJaQbQ,A couple of the downfalls you describe are due to the fact that Microsoft wants you to use their infrastructure. for example: online collaboration is possible via Sharepoint. This gives you a (very simple) version control as well. Automation should become better with the intruction of Python.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I met an ""experienced"" wannabe making claims that excel is the best tool for analytics, me and my little knowledge literally laughed my ass off, he no longer speaks to me these days🤣🤣"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Therapeutic indeed...😂
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I love it when it just randomly crashes and closes a few xlsx files at once without any notice. Well, not that randomly, as it happens under heavy use."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"ALSO, i really hate the formula's syntax...M for life! heuehueheu"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I was just saying how much I hated Excel the other day. Who needs Excel anyway when you have Python and SQL?
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Microsoft will not develop Excel more than their other products like Power bi. If u do want larger data set to be analysed for rationality than pay more & go for Power bi 😅
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Small chargers from Microsoft 🤑😁
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"You are right. Excel is no less than an anxiety and stress in such contexts.
 In your opinion what is the alternative if we are dealing with big data sets and that we need to avoid the stress and frustration  from excel in such scenarios(the reasons you have mentioned in the video), should we use Python or any other tool?"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I love excel, but for accounting and not with data analysis"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I'm waiting for excel with python - first thing I will install pandas and polars 🥳
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I hate what Excel does to data files. So many times someone sends me a data file to load into a database and leading zeroes are dropped from zip codes, columns are misaligned, or other odd issues...this happens especially when people open a csv directly into Excel, save it, then pass it along to be loaded into a database."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"I started my data analysis journey learning R. I never used excel in the degree I am in now. I did the google data analysis cert, and used sheets and excel (both I was excited to learn due to most jobs saying they want you to know it). However, I just went back to using R for almost everything because it’s just so much better."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I once rejected a job offer because  they were using only Excel FOR DATA VISUALIZATION 😂
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"While I agree with your statements on general, i still love excel as it was the start of my passion with data😊. 
Excel will do all the jobs when your data is relatively small AND your using power query and data models. (Less than 1 million rows easily and up to 2 millions with some difficulty). If your data is more use other solutions

The other point is that all business world are still depending on it, so it's basic skill that you need"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"In all fairness to Excel: it was never designed for this level of data or type of activity. If you could start from scratch, how would you redesign it?

Here's what I'd do:
1. Integrate local python / R usage as well as allowing it to execute the code remotely in the cloud.
2. Version control.
3. Online colab instead of purely local (Google Sheets)
4. Better visualization builder.
5. Better handling of Big Data (all hail the Big Data)
6. Kill VBA. Just let it die.
7. Better automation."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Whatever analysis I do my colleagues ask me eventually to send an Excel file.
TGAUZQJaQbQ,Hello Alex. Can you make a video on entry level remote data analyst jobs? It would help a lot
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"wps better, sometimes we get data from sql and clean it through wps"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"My love for excel is broken now XD, hope you give us better alternatives to excel in other video"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"thats really interesting you struggled with the processes you can complete to automate with VBA, i was tasked to do a lot of VBA automation in my first role and the only time i ran into issues was when external/internal data changed formatting etc"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"This is interesting. I'm starting in data analytics and I've had this idea that I should use Excel since it's an industry standard. I used it back in the days (when Google Sheets didn't exist) but eventually switched over Google Sheets because it's free, the interface is much nicer and has plenty to offer for analytics. Trying out Excel now feels like a step back, especially in terms of UI.
Maybe you should do a head to head Google Sheets vs Excel video."
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"Hi Alex cool video, but for collaboration u can upload ur files to one drive and share file with others"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,sure I use sql in R  where initially i used excel
TGAUZQJaQbQ,realy
TGAUZQJaQbQ,"My supervisor asked me a few minutes ago why I do most of analysis in SQL and I was wondering: “Isn’t it obvious? It’s smoother, faster and less likely to make mistakes”.

Then I come on YouTube and I see this video. I’m not alone"
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I love excel it's straight forward app
TGAUZQJaQbQ,I do like the ease of use with excel.. with small data sets!
HYD8KjPB9F8,Interesting lesson

HYD8KjPB9F8,"Alex hi
Thanks for this job, you did a great job helping people want to become a data analytics, but you skippid many parts in setting up mysql
in the download i needed to look for other video for indian guy who explained how to download step by step 
even when you imported the parks and the recreation file and started to work on it, i also didnt understand how you just put it into mysql enviroment 
so i found someone who imported it from server easily... please do not skip the most important parts.. because the hard thing in the start is the MYSQL enviroment and not the SQL language itself .."
HYD8KjPB9F8,"Hello, second of day of watching and following your tutorials.😊, Done"
HYD8KjPB9F8,"i am a truly beginner, and your tutorials really help"
HYD8KjPB9F8,Thanks Alex
HYD8KjPB9F8,Practice makes perfect they say. Didn't note of the data base selection earlier and was having problem practising the subsequent lessons. Great lessons.

HYD8KjPB9F8,can someone please tell me where i can download the table he is using in the video?
HYD8KjPB9F8,When we use SELECT * it shows null value whereas when I used SELECT first_name it showed all values except null. Why? thanks!
HYD8KjPB9F8,"Hi! I’m following along with your MySQL tutorial, and I successfully set up the server and MySQL just like you showed in the first video. However, when I tried to log back into the server the next day, it asked me for a password. I entered the password I set up, but it wouldn’t let me in. I’d really like to keep learning with your videos, but I’m stuck at this step. Do you have any advice on how to solve this? Thanks so much for the tutorials – I’m really excited to learn more!"

wgRwITQHszU,"Hi there , i can't create de root account password  can someone tell me how to do it"
wgRwITQHszU,The problem with this video is that it requires you to get the 8.0.32 version of my sql when it's at 8.0.41 as of today. Meaning some things shown here won't be shown on the new version. I tried downloading the 8.0.32 version. I succeeded but faced an error where I couldn't use it anymore. Alex needs to make videos how to start this with the new version for newbies.

1LG65qXfeQY,"It was a great starting point for using python. But in m'y opinion it would be really more helpfull to show how to tackle a Real dataset and how thing goes on with several python méthodes
But anyway, thanks a lot for this session 🍻"

QzLz-W29Tww,Thanks
QzLz-W29Tww,"Hey Alex, I started my channel about a year and a half ago! Thanks for this video 🙏🏾🤩"
QzLz-W29Tww,What I hated the most when I was starting on my main channel was that I had better content and videos generally than most of the bigger youtubers but i just couldn't move from a dead point. Here is my advice for beginners. invest couple of dollars in Fame ster and save yourself from stressing. I was sceptic and scared for may channel but it is completely safe. Cheers!
QzLz-W29Tww,"I've just finished watching your video on starting a data-focused YouTube channel, and I felt compelled to reach out and express my gratitude for the insights you've shared. As someone who has been contemplating the idea of launching a similar channel, your advice and guidance have proven to be invaluable.

Your approach to breaking down the process into digestible steps was particularly impactful. You didn't merely suggest ""starting a channel,"" but instead provided practical guidance on identifying a niche, crafting engaging content, and effective methods of promoting a channel. Your honesty when discussing the challenges one might face, such as finding motivation and overcoming the fear of exposure, was truly appreciated.

Your emphasis on authenticity resonated deeply with me. Instead of advocating for mimicry of successful channels, you champion the idea of discovering our own unique voice and style. In my opinion, this authenticity is the key ingredient in creating a distinctive and captivating channel.

One enlightening point you made was about the importance of having a content plan. I agree that a clear roadmap for the channel not only fuels motivation but also ensures the consistency and relevance of the content. This is something I'm keen to incorporate into my own strategy.

In conclusion, your video has provided the impetus I needed to kick-start my own data YouTube channel. Your evident passion and enthusiasm for your work are infectious and inspiring. Thank you, Alex, for generously sharing your knowledge and experiences with us. Your video has not only equipped me with valuable techniques and strategies but has also reignited my motivation to embark on this exciting journey."
QzLz-W29Tww,Hey Alex just wanted to give you a huge shout for imparting me knowledge and confidence to go and build my own tableau portfolio and get employed. You are doing a commendable job. Keep on doing the good deed and all the best for future.😁
QzLz-W29Tww,"Thank you, Alex, for the excellent advice! Pretty inspiring! I just started my channel weeks ago. Sometimes I thought I knew something well, but it turned out I didn't. Teaching is really a great way of learning."
QzLz-W29Tww,It will be really great if you make a video on technical interviews for an entry level data analyst such as what questions are generally asked and a summary regarding the same! Thanks!
QzLz-W29Tww,"Once you decided that you're more of youtuber than data analyst, the content value of this channel is decreasing"
QzLz-W29Tww,@alextheanalyst  Not relevant to this post but I can't access the discord platform on analyst builder. It's saying the address is invalid. I'm also having trouble importing the 'world life expectancy' data to MySQL. It imports perfectly to Excel but only imports 25% of the data to Mysql. Any suggestions?
QzLz-W29Tww,"I'm starting one called Datagnolo in Italian, i'm not hoping to get a lot of views due Italy has only 60 million people, so not many of those will be interested in my content, But I want to do it to practice my data analysis skills and Italian skills.

I did something similar 4 years ago i started a YouTube channel talking about YouTube, and YouTube management in English and helped a lot to improve my English skills I even got clients as a YouTube manager =) 

So if you're reading this message, and you're thinking to start a YouTube channel, don't overthink it but don't do it for the views or subscribers, do it for some reason it's more important to you than external approval."
QzLz-W29Tww,"Exactly the same reasons for starting a channel as me. 

I needed a way to force learning but learning in a way you know enough to teach some one, basically a form of the Feynman technique, and document what I learn / create so I have it as a reminder, but also giving back to the data community as I have learnt so much from long running data YouTubers.

Feels great to give back 😀  One thing I would add is for anyone starting youtube, it takes time to grow so just enjoy the journey and don't let the early low subs and views get you down. Just keep posting and see if it's something you enjoy first and then decide if you want to do as just a hobby, part time or full time, so you don't burn out."
QzLz-W29Tww,"Hey Alex, can you do a tutorial about Credit Risk Analysis or maybe a tutorial on forecasting  ?"
QzLz-W29Tww,Please make a video on IBM spss
QzLz-W29Tww,"Candid and helpful as always. You share insights and information without any material gain from the viewers. You remind me of Dr Eric Berg, who shares medical information without any material gain and is ever candid to his audience."
QzLz-W29Tww,"Great tips!  I like that you provide free options.  I watched another youtuber based in the Netherlands and she had really expensive equipment.  She is also very upbeat like you.  But because of the equipment, I thought, maybe I should save up for those before I start.  Thankfully, this came out and I saw cost_free options.  Well, not entirely free...youtube content creation will still cost time away from other priorities 😊"
QzLz-W29Tww,Thanks for sharing! Your videos were such an inspiration to start my TikTok page!
QzLz-W29Tww,"Immediately i saw this video, my heart really skipped. I felt like this video is really for me."
QzLz-W29Tww,"I think I may do this! Thanks, Alex! 🙌🏼"
QzLz-W29Tww,What I hated the most when I was starting on my main channel was that I had better content and videos generally than most of the bigger youtubers but i just couldn't couldn't get recognized by many people. Here is my advice for beginners no matter what kind of content you have - invest couple of dollars in Fame Ster Social and save yourself from stressing.
QzLz-W29Tww,"Hello Alex, love your videos.

I've been surfing the internet to gather information about the job role of a data analyst. I have found that DAs are required to interact with stakeholders on the business/operations/finance side of the company, and for this, having ""domain knowledge"" is preferred in addition to technical skills.

Could you please make a video about different domains that DAs can choose to get into, and also suggest some resources to learn about those domains so that we can be job ready.

Many thanks!"
QzLz-W29Tww,This is how you invent the wheel without re-inventing the wheel. Infinite loop... Awesome!
QzLz-W29Tww,"Thank you for this, Alex! I'm considering starting a YouTube channel because I become extremely nervous when speaking in front of more than two or three people, to the point where I freeze up. I hope that I can gain a bit of confidence by speaking to the camera and sharing it with the world."
QzLz-W29Tww,Thank you for your video. Just in time for me. Great video!
QzLz-W29Tww,"Thank you for sharing.
This is a very useful information."
QzLz-W29Tww,I started my channel this summer to build the foundation of switching from an Analyst to a Data Scientist. 2k subs and about 3 uploads every week! Watched your channel a few years ago when I was in my Electrical Engineering degree and wanted to switch to data
QzLz-W29Tww,Thank you for the video Alex it'll be very helpful for starting my own channel
QzLz-W29Tww,Very cool. You were definitely one of the people who inspired me to start a channel too - great stuff as always 😁😁
QzLz-W29Tww,What's your creative process Alex? Do you have a specific way to come up with ideas?
QzLz-W29Tww,"Hello Alex, how do you edit your videos wherein your face recording comes in one right corner and in the centre you are showing the main content?"
QzLz-W29Tww,"great content like everytime, Alex. Awesome."
QzLz-W29Tww,"Great video Alex, you were part of the reason why I started my own channel recently, so thanks for the inspiration 💪"
QzLz-W29Tww,Thanks Alex. I thought about creating a catalan data youtube channel but I don't feel like I can spend time to make a weekly video. How much time do you spend or do you recommended to spend at least?
QzLz-W29Tww,Inspiring👏👏 Got the energy I needed to upload my first video. Thanks Alex
QzLz-W29Tww,Thank you for this video. I think this gonna help those folks who are really interested to create their own channel. I would request you to create a video on “How to make a resume for data analyst role” for those who are transitioning from different domains. I have seen people mentioning how much impact they have created to solve the problem (for eg: resulting in a 15% increase in overall productivity).
QzLz-W29Tww,INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO ME 6 MONTHS AGO 😂
ukIUVW2E-n0,Purchased the Lifetime question package. Any plans for people such as me to upgrade to the lifetime courses and questions package? I wouldn't just wanna lose the money spent on the questions package by wanting to upgrade to a full bigger package.

aofB2t5o2ao,"POTATOES!! (A year later 😅) Thank you so much Alex! Did some courses in Analyst Builder as well and love your way of teaching….
and I’m terrified to go into this field officially, but your talks, encouragement, advice, and tutorials make all this less scary! Thanks so much! …and yes, I did wait around for that burp."
aofB2t5o2ao,Potatoes
aofB2t5o2ao,Potato!!! Shout out from South Africa and thanks for the great advice 🙏🏽
aofB2t5o2ao,"Is this yet another video of ""upworker"" thinking he is a consultant or what ? You can be amazing engineer, analyst or whatever, the key is branding, attracting and closing clients. If you do that, you do not even need to be a good engineer or analyst or consultant, you can hire someone else. So all this I am I am, is absolute garbage. You are whatever platforms or your clients make out of you, unless you can command something. And there are zillions of people who can do great analytics and all of them think they are super duper heros."
aofB2t5o2ao,"Potatoes!
Great video and very helpful for my data analytics career path."
aofB2t5o2ao,Potatoes !
aofB2t5o2ao,"34:00 even with contracts i've had 6 not pay
each time you think you have learnt your lesson - you know they have the money bc after 2 clients decided to skip out going fwd i asked potential clients to prove that they could pay 
and then you think, is it a hassle to bring them to small claims court  and then you decide to just write it off bc the startup community is small and if others knew that you would make it a big deal to go after those that owe you for work done then i was afraid of my name being smeared

but my due diligence is warning a lot of consultants/freelancers"

aofB2t5o2ao,"My problem is procrastination. Some of it has been because in my current career, I make more than starting analytics salaries. Potatoes. Thanks, Alex. I have watched this and used the channel since 2020 or 2021."
aofB2t5o2ao,Potatoe!!
aofB2t5o2ao,"POTATO! The best tip from this video, 'Text your wife even if you are in the middle of a recording (work)'😂😂. 

It's honestly really helpful video. Each section teaches a lot. Most of the things are applicable for both beginners and experienced persons as well. 

Alex seems to be a great person to me. Not only because of his professionalism, but also the way he speaks, the way he guides you through things, the way he explains, and the best thing is the smile he always has on his face. That adds a lot into the professional as well as the humanly character of a person. 

Listen to this video and you will have a lot of things that you really wanna try as a freelancer, as a business owner and as a data analyst as well. ❣

💓Huge Love and Respect to you Buddy. Keep up the good work"

-DwpkgtJjGw,Can i be both? Or just one of them i should choose
-DwpkgtJjGw,Data analyst is basically a tech ba or a Devops person. BAs don't go into coding we just test the final product.
-DwpkgtJjGw,Great video! I created a Notion + GPT system to track my data analyst learning path  it really helps me stay focused and consistent
-DwpkgtJjGw,What about Business Data Analyst
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Happy Guru Purnima sir 😊
From India"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"You perfect in every thing 
But sorry you speak very quickly 
i can't understand or even read caption 😢"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"So what do you recommend newcomers to learn from to understand how to do these things? If certs are worthless, where to learn?"
-DwpkgtJjGw,Is data analysis the same as data engineering?
-DwpkgtJjGw,Some folks are calling a business analyst a data analyst to be honest.
-DwpkgtJjGw,Which one is more likely to find work as a freelancer?
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Hi, please can you recommend a job ready business analytics training I can apply to?"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Can u explain the process from when u get assigned to a project to finishing it, I mean the tasks in between doing projects?"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"I’m currently a Business Analyst. I use a lot of Excel and pull reports from tableau. I work with internal team, so my director will request a report and I send it to them or sales team. I would like to be Data Analyst within the company I currently work for as they get paid more. Any tips? I’m a contractor and I have taken a data analytics bootcamp."
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Thanks Alex, you're the best 👍👍👍"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Hi alex !
I have learnt Excel , sql , powerbi , Tableau 
From your youtube channel can i apply for intern position with these skills in companies"
-DwpkgtJjGw,Thanks a lot
-DwpkgtJjGw,How much math can you say is involved in both roles and which one can you say its a bit less stressful
-DwpkgtJjGw,😂😂😂
-DwpkgtJjGw,Is the path to learn data analysis the same as learning business analysis?
-DwpkgtJjGw,"What is the future of data analyst with AI in place, like co-pilot for example and give insights on certain data?"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Just got enrolled for Stony University data analytics bootcamp. However, being a BI Analyst fits my skill set more. Great explanation btw!"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"At Amazon, the roles are reversed. BAs are more technical and get paid more."
-DwpkgtJjGw,"I'm a business analyst und I do absoluetly not programming in sql or else. And rarely excel, i wish I did what you described :'( , is it not more business intelligence analyst?"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Business analyst button 
👇"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"In the UK Data Analyst has basically evolved to mean ""basic office administrator"", which is causing all sorts of confusion on the job market.  

Took me a while to work out that the ""Data Analyst"" jobs I was being put forward for were really just clerical roles that called for no coding or even formula skills.

And Business Analyst can often mean someone who looks at the bigger picture - how systems of procedures all work together (although again sometimes denotes a quite basic operational admin role)"
-DwpkgtJjGw,Thanks for the information
-DwpkgtJjGw,My title is business analyst but I do the job of a data analyst for my boss. I'm basically their personal data analyst lol
-DwpkgtJjGw,Thank you
-DwpkgtJjGw,Interesting
-DwpkgtJjGw,Finally I got the difference from these two.thankyou sir🎉
-DwpkgtJjGw,"So clear, thanks 😊"
-DwpkgtJjGw,@AlexTheAnalyst. How can I get a quick taste of the work samples to see if I would enjoy/excel at coding or data analysis or neither?
-DwpkgtJjGw,"I have a question: I hold an MBA and i have obtained courses on Excel, SQL, tableau, and python... So should i apply for business analyst or data analyst to land a job faster ?!"
-DwpkgtJjGw,Perfect explanation... Thanks
-DwpkgtJjGw,👏👏💯
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Hello, And what is the difference between business intelligence developer, data analyst and data scientist?"
-DwpkgtJjGw,"Yup, that is what I currently do. Business Analyst. :)"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Amazing 🎉 ❤
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I will definitely purchase this in future once my finances get me there. I love your kind of spirit.  You're a blessing
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Great video. Please provide a discount code for your website.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,congrats alex your effort
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hey Alex, When does beta end and become the ""real""  version? My financial situation is in the crapper for the forseeable future and don't know when I'll be able to buy access (due to my wife's medical issues i had to pull back from data analysis skill building,  so feel like im further behind than when I first started a year and a half ago)"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alright Alex … I’m in!! Lifetime Subscriber & I’m ready to learn! I got to support my Carolina Homie & after seeing this video it really shows your true heart in just wanting people to learn and helping them achieve their dreams and goals!! I appreciate you, sir and I am looking forward to achieving my goal in 2024 to finally shifting my career in purchasing to working as a data analyst!!!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hello Mr. Alex I just want to Let you know that all your courses from the youtube channel down to the new website that you build is all awsome and it greatly helps me. And I hope someday I will be like you, from a nobody to Hero. Your an awsome and cool person. I'm going to save up money to purchase the full $249 bundle (for me $249 is still expensive specially when your from a poor country like Philippines hehehe)... Cheers to your Success!!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Congrats for this lunch! You have definitely put in a lot of work into this. I created an account but not being able to log in.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,🎉congratulations
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Would you say this your version of a boot camp?By this I mean you would learn everything to land you your entry level job? Or is this  more of a way to help you further your knowledge while going to school/ boot camp/or working as a data analyst?
h4KTy2wxYcQ,This is so exciting! Is there a recommended order to take the courses in? Or does anyone have a recommendation for which one to start with for someone just starting out?
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Congrats Alex! So proud of you as my mentor and role model! Great website, I am going all in!!! Thanks for keeping the vibe up and coming with amazing content!!!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alex, Congratulations and what´s the advantage of this platform rather than Data Camp?"

"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Love your energy and just want to say big thanks for all your work and inspiration for people
It helps a lot for me
(Thanks to team who works with Alex too)
Wanted to say that on discord channel after your superfast answering my problem but didn't find channel or smth for appreciations

P.S.: Sorry for mistakes, eng is not my language kinda hard to talk with it"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alex, I'm told that maths forms quite a large part of being a data analyst. I only did foundation level maths as school so didn't do any sort of statistics or fancy maths really beyond the basics. Do i need to know more maths I. E. Stats, algebra etc? If so, what do you recommend? Any courses etc? Thanks!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,is there any competion for data analytics ?can you just say how to participate and where to participate?..
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"This is awesome Alex!
Congratulations!
Thanks."

h4KTy2wxYcQ,It’s time 🎉😊❤
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hi Alex - Already in the waitlist ⏱Will you release full Data Analytics course as well ( Like Excel, SQL, PBI/Tab, Python, R, Statistics ) ?? Instead of separate courses like you have shown in video.."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,This is absolutely amazing and I can't wait...
h4KTy2wxYcQ,This is the most goated thing i have ever seen. Thank you for all that you do for us future data analysts
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"I wasn't quite sure why I was digging this (I mean, of course, I love it cause it's ATA), but when you said ""dark mode"", the light bulb (no pun intended) went off.  I LOVE dark mode!!!!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"The intricate nature of this platform is super impressive , Alex. Combined with your jovial personality, it is a win win for everyone! Congratulations to you and your amazing team."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"wow, nice website

h4KTy2wxYcQ,Looking forward to beta! Thank you for your dedication Alex.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I'm excited to get the lifetime access!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Signed up. Got back into SQL recently and I am loving it. Last SQL job I applied for, I bombed the questions, so the interview prep is of particular interest."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Not me constantly checking my email for the beta launch 😅 I'm so excited. Congratulations Alex and thank you for all that you do for the data community.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Congratulations on the launch. I can't wait to experience it firsthand. I do have a question about possible add-ons: will you be including Excel?
h4KTy2wxYcQ,thank you for what you do. :)
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Do you plan on having an editor for Snowflake in the future? Cloud databases are becoming more mainstream and to build comfortability in using that platform would be fun and exciting to learn.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Congrats Alex, I cannot wait to test it out!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Beautiful worl!!! You will help a lot of people Team Alex!!!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"You are one of the best teachers who taught me alot and I am really grateful.
Although I can not afford it but I will do it anyhow :)
you deserve the subscription"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Not gonna lie what would be cool, if you released after lets say a year a video of you analyzing the data from the website or something to see some real world problems"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Wow, the Analyst Builder looks awesome! Looking forward to the beta launch! Thanks for all of your hard work in building it and also for pricing it affordably."

h4KTy2wxYcQ,alex this is so cool -- i hope you talk more about this in other places to spread the word!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Cant wait,Thank you so much for all your hardwork ❤"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,That $249 bundle for lifetime access to the courses and questions is an insanely good deal! I'm buying that for sure. Congrats on the launch! 🙌🏽
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Waiting the Beta from Argentina!! Thanks for all your hard work Alex and your team!! I wish you all the success you deserve 🥰
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Hey Alex! How would this platform compare to Datacamp?
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hi Alex, is the waitlist closed? I tried submitting my email a few times on the landing page, but was unsuccessful."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"I was waiting 🎉🎉
Congratulations"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,You sold me on the 249 bundle! Ive appreciated your videos and time to compensate you
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alex! This is amazing!! I am so excited! This looks like it's really going to fill in all the learning gaps I've had. The editor within the course to tackle questions as I learn is amazing! I can't wait to get my email! One question: Will you be coming out with projects for a portfolio for the advanced SQL and will you be doing a visualization course in Tableau? Sorry, that's 2 questions lol! Thank you so much for everything you've invested into this project! You deserve to be so proud and I wish you all the success!!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Congratulations on your project and I can’t wait to try it out!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,this looks aweseome Alex!!! Signed up a couple months ago and i cant wait to get access!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Congratulations Alex 
The questions section is it going to be updated with new questions frequently?"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Sold! Sign me up
h4KTy2wxYcQ,This is what I've been dreaming of. I was watching your youtube data bootcamp videos the last few weeks ans getting so overwhelmed by not being able to figure it out going between youtube and mss. Will be buying the lifetime of everything. Will be so helpful to get into a data analyst role and help me level up in the future. Thank you. Thank you.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,so far im liking what im seeing I was looking for something like this congratulations in all the work you have done for the website. cant wait to test it out myself.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hi Alex, it’d be great if you can generate certificates for the courses too"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"This is revolution of learning Data analysis. One of the most amazing learning platform that has ever created. Well done Alex, can’t wait to enhance my knowledge 🤲"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alex, congrats on launching this my dude!  I know it's been a long time in the works and nothing short of a lot of you and your team's effort 🙌🏼"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"The video explanation is what sells it for me, will you bundle the questions with the course bundle too? can't wait to try it."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,What about including excel courses into this? Might blow Maven Analytics out of the water👀
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Getting the Lifetime Membership! So excited!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alex at this rate you are going to be a Marvel super hero character haha, been waiting for this, glad to see its almost here, can't wait to dive in.
Also I wanted to ask, is there going to be an instalment payment option for the Lifetime access purchase? I know you are doing a lot of charity just making it affordable but for me and maybe a few people atm, I can not commit all that money at one go right now unless in the future. However if this is not possible I am still more than happy to pay for the lesser option.
You are a legend Alex."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hey, Alex! I love your videos and i'm very excited for the plataform because i wanted to be a data analyst because of you. But i'm from brazil and i think the pricing from courses out of our country can be a little too much for us here. I hope i'll be able to sign up and explore it!!!

Thank you. Much Love from Brazil!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Thank you so much for sharing and congratulations on launching soon!! It’s a tremendous milestone! Look forward to contributing to the community!!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I think I signed up twice. Not sure.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I would give you an Oscar for Data Community. You are always thinking about people. You are a really unique data guy. Thank you for everything.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"I'm so excited about this website! Your YouTube videos have been so helpful. $249 is a great value. Thanks, Alex!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Thank you so much, your courses are always innovative. Looking forward to the beta launch."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I’m so excited for this!! This is exactly what I’m looking for. Thank you for putting this together for us!
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"I would like to see LinkedIn intergration. Largely because I'm trying to do a career change, and I'm trying to show potential recruiters that I'm a data analyst, and I am at a huge disadvantage in terms of background and education."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,This looks awesome. I can't wait to try it and land my first analyst position! I've been watching your videos and interacting with your LinkedIn posts. I've come a long way because of you! And thank you for making it affordable. Means a ton.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Excited to see the platform go live.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Congrats Alex! Your the first person i started following when thinking about changing jobs to data analytics. Will the websote have projects for our portfolio using sql/excel to make dashboards? I'm struggling to build up a portfolio to start applying and debating your lifetime level or just buying udemy courses/kaggle projects? Thanks for any advice you can give.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Can't wait for this! Looks like a solid comprehensive platform. It'll save me from having to pay $40/mo for Dataquest over the next year 😅
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I've been following this for a long time and can't wait. Definitely getting the lifetime access
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Thanks so much, Alex. You've been a blessing."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,This looks absolutely awesome. The walkthrough process you touched on is something I’ve always appreciated with my learning style. Definitely grabbing the bundle. Thanks Alex
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"This is FANTASTIC
I’m looking forward to trying it out! 
Thanks Alex"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"I can’t wait to try this out and to test where I am skill wise. Really looking forward to the projects. 

If I may add a suggestion. If you don’t already have it on your list can you add a “placement test” so that people can see what they already know and where their holes in education is? It can take that information to suggest brushing up on x,y,z skill or suggest they start with beginner, intermediate, or advanced level based on how your levels are broken up in the courses."
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Hey Alex, 

I just wanted to start by saying I honestly can't wait for this site, I have been waking up and checking my emails every day waiting for this beta lol. Second I just finished this video and I had a question on the pricing, so if we were to purchase the lifetime bundle we would have access to those four courses that you currently have and any future courses that you add? Does this also include the premium questions, so all of the questions that we saw in this video and any future questions? I apologize in advance if this is a ""dumb"" question I just want to make sure I understand it correctly before I purchase it ( once it comes out of course ). Thank you in advance for your response and thank you for all the hard work you put in to teach us!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Sick!! ❤ I’m gonna buy the lifetime. Honestly, you’ve done so much to help n support all of us so I def want to support you n the team.😊"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Alex, this is really amazing. I can't thank you enough and I really appreciate your dedication and kindness to always sharing what you have learned with us, so that we can get into the clear and right path.. best of luck for you and your team 🙏🏻🔥"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Congratulations for all your hardwork and Thank you, Alex for creating courses for people who wish to land the data analytics field as me. Your Analyst Builder platform is absolutely amazing and making prices affordable which really have impact in this expensive world. I believe it is available to purchase worldwide as I am from the UK. I followed most of your excellent courses on YouTube for awhile by now. I'm hoping to land a data analyst job at one day with the worries of being in my mid 35th from switching careers and having low self-esteem. All the courses are extremely helpful, straightforward and knowledgeable. Please keep up the hard work, Alex!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Best of luck Alex! I'm definitely going to check it out! BTW the platform looks amazing!❤
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Unless I've misunderstood, this sounds like I could pick a SQL query I can answer and use it to myself how to replicate in python?

If so game changer!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"love how excited you are and your content has been helpful. but what’s the difference between analyst builder and hackkerank? sincerely, there’s a burn out of people frustrated from doing all these and not getting a job, so apart from certificates, are there any guarantees to having an advantage over others? e.g vouchers for certifications or recommendations? i don’t know if you get what i mean. can’t wait for the launch and congratulations"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Outstanding vision alex but I personally think you might have to be competitive about the course pricing to udemy...
h4KTy2wxYcQ,Please bro Please make it affordable.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,"Looks great, Alex. Can’t wait to check it out!"
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I’m excited to use this as someone who is already a data analyst. I need more experience with SQL and Python.
h4KTy2wxYcQ,I'm doing your analyst vids on YT but I'm still excited to get into Analyst Builder!
LaRXtE4OG9A,I have completed the data analytics course from your videos . But I didn't do any projects . I need to prepare more and complete projects and I hope I will land a job at the end of this year thank you so much Alex . Your are the best teacher.❤
LaRXtE4OG9A,I need help with SQL Python  and Tableau so bad.im so lost and was just layed off
LaRXtE4OG9A,"I work as a Data Analyst in the oil and gas sector. I primarily use Excel and SQL. My worry is that my educational background is in Educational Technology, and I'll have trouble getting an offer in tech, as they often require a degree in Engineering, CS or maths. But I know R, in addition to Excel & SQL. I also know advance statistics such multi-level modelling. Given these, would I have trouble working in tech as a DS?"
LaRXtE4OG9A,It still makes me laugh how many people are shocked and awed when i use a simple vlookup to do a job in a few seconds that they say they spend hours on. Then proceed to not learn it at all.
LaRXtE4OG9A,"The problrm is that even if you are not going to use those, most of even entry level and junior jobs expects you to have all of those."
LaRXtE4OG9A,Part 2?
LaRXtE4OG9A,But what if you can already use python or Rstudio to go through data? Will the companies have anything against it?
LaRXtE4OG9A,"This is so true! I literally just started working as a Data Analyst and the public school I work for has just SQL and MS Report Builder... not the snappiest of response times for queries and report-building compared to my previous Corpo-rat job as a Front-End Dev, but I am happy to flex my brain in a crunchier way that I am enjoying so much better! Hopefully, next role will be at a fancier company with shiny new tools... but this is awesome for starting my Tech Career pivot during a rough economy!"
LaRXtE4OG9A,"Agree! If you are a data analyst, you might tap into the data source yourself using SQL, or someone else will make a .csv avaliable for you. Even if you use Python for data cleansing, ultimately your internal client will use Excel so you need to know it well enough to present the results in a way they will understand and be able to perform ad hoc analysis on the fly."
LaRXtE4OG9A,And yet I still can't get a job in data analytics because I'm defined by my employment history and recruiters and hiring managers ignore the certifications and education.
LaRXtE4OG9A,Yes. So glad you mentioned this.
LaRXtE4OG9A,"Hi Alex
I am big fan of your videos on YouTube
I am from Bharat"
LaRXtE4OG9A,Nice
LaRXtE4OG9A,"Meanwhile if you look at junior data analyst vacancy in Indonesia, you'll find out that almost all of them require Python, which is ridiculous"
LaRXtE4OG9A,"Thank you for saying this!! There is a misconception out there that the more tools you know, the better analyst you are!! Which is not true at all!!"
LaRXtE4OG9A,What if i am using Bigquery and google sheets ?
LaRXtE4OG9A,I try to find you on LinkedIn but I can't 😕😕 please share you I'd ❤
LaRXtE4OG9A,Thanks for sharing data analysis full playlist it's very helpfull for me thanks a lot @AlexTheAnalyst❤❤
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"Can anyone give me a glimpse of what do data analysts do in healthcare,"
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"I want to specialize in Human Resources, I feel like HR needs to use tech and data more often"
J0PcCv9f4JQ,I just complted first monthy of my data analyst journey.
J0PcCv9f4JQ,How to learn and expertise in a domain
J0PcCv9f4JQ,True
J0PcCv9f4JQ,I am interested in working in Health Industry. which program should I take Health Informatics program? do you have any suggestion for me? I studied computer science.
J0PcCv9f4JQ,Absolutely!! Learning SQL & Tableau was very easy compared to the domain knowledge
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"I have a background in neuroscience. I am interested in specializing in healthcare analytics. What specific languages or courses would you recommend? I am currently enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certification program. So far, I am learning alot about Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets SQL, R. Any suggestions?"
J0PcCv9f4JQ,Be great at one rather than being good at all.
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"Wow, it's fascinating that I've also received advice to narrow my focus to a specific field rather than pursuing a general Data Analysis role. I'm particularly interested in healthcare, but it might be more challenging to find an internship that aligns with my aspirations in this field. So I wonder whether it's necessary to select a domain at this stage or simply get into a company and follow the field they specialize in? :>>"
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"Great video. New analyst should have several domains they have knowledge of, but as they advance, it should become more narrowed."
J0PcCv9f4JQ,Why is it so difficult getting a job as a data analyst
J0PcCv9f4JQ,Unless John was a black trannsgender then he definitely would get the job
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"This makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the great videos, Alex!"
J0PcCv9f4JQ,We need a new updated video about data analyst industries. Thanks 🙌
J0PcCv9f4JQ,"Alex, how can i specialize in healthcare for data analysis?"
J0PcCv9f4JQ,Do you think Marketing analyst is a good specialisation to take?
J0PcCv9f4JQ,dumb question. How do I especialize in a specific domain?
J0PcCv9f4JQ,Data analyst in FinTech is big money.
J0PcCv9f4JQ,I’m shooting for cybersecurity analyst 🙏🏼 thanks. For all u do Alex!

EflE8U30pBo,"Good morning Alex, sorry I tried reaching out on LinkedIn but your dm is locked. Please I’m trying to create my data analysis resume. On the project section, how do newbies go about it since I don’t have any experience yet & I haven’t done any real life project with a company. Is there any place we can get data & questions to carry out a real project? I’ll really love your feedback on this."
EflE8U30pBo,"Hi, Alex just started my journey to Data Science, thanks for your content"
EflE8U30pBo,"Hi Alexander, your bald spot is as smooth and clear as your training, thank you for your bald spot."
EflE8U30pBo,Will analyst builder include cloud?
EflE8U30pBo,"Hi Alex, thank you for the videos. In my 40’s and switching careers. Taking google DA prof cert course. On section 7 of 8 but not feeling like I’m super sure of how much it has taught me lol.. thoughts? Advice? Thank you"

xuyKzpJ2SaY,"The issue with SAS is that its a siloed solution, sure you can connect a db, but thats about it. If you want to build anything beyond a simple report or model used within the sas platform, youre SOL"
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"For those who ❤ Statistics, Data Analytics, etc. just learn that. SAS, R or Python are mere tools. If you’ve got the impression that you’ll get to choose which tool you’ll use at your workplace you’re in for a big surprise. 😢 In my case, I’ve used SAS for 10+ years in the healthcare industry. For the past 2-3 years we’ve managed to change most of our codebase to R, by management decision, and make some 7 figures cost cuts. And yes, GitHub Copilot helped a lot. The things I’m able to do with the ‘tidyverse’ packages in R compared with the effort put in with SAS in the past… Out of nostalgia I follow the SAS channels on YT, hoping that some miraculously things would happen. Then I’m reminded of MACROS and the DATA step and sadness sets in. Nonetheless, the fresh pool of talents coming from academia haven’t heard of SAS. There’s a lot of effort put into by SAS towards machine learning in recent years. You’re better off with Python and Knime if you want to go in that direction and save some money. I wouldn’t bet against SAS either. This could become a niche segment very fast. Just look at at the COBOL language in banking industry."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,How do people think about the need of learning SAS if you already know python?
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"SAS hasn't stood for ""Statistical Analysis System"" for many years..."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,SASing
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"I've been in my current role for a little over a year, this is my first healthcare analyst role using SAS.  I feel that we use SAS Enterprise Guide very little for statistical purposes and more for ETL from several different data sources, as our primary team database and for automated scheduled reporting with extracts to shared locations and emailed attachments (Excel, PDF and embedded email body reports) similar to how I used to use  Microsoft's SSRS in my previous teams.  For dashboards, we push data out to Tableau to build them there."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"Thanks for your sharing on your thought on SAS Explore event, sound like a good experience"
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Sir make a video on statistics for data analysis.
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"I THINK YOU SHOULD CREATE A SINGLE PROJECT WHICH INVOLVES ALL TOOLS LIKE PYTHON , SQL ,TABLEAU IT WILL HELP US A LOT."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,AN EXEC AT SAS HELPED WIRETAP MY COMPUTERS TO STEAL MY ASSETS WITH USING WEB WATCHERS AND AWARENESS TECHNOLOGIES WHO VIOLATE THE FEDERAL WIRETAP APP. STALKING MYSELF AND CHILDREN. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND THOSE INVADING PRIVACY ARRESTED AND PLACED IN FEDERAL PRISON THE CEO RUNNING CHILDRENSORGS AND COS IS VERY CONCERNING.
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"Hey Alex Good morning and Thank you for all you ressources. Because you're my raw model in data analysis, today I commit myself to finish the Coursera data analysis in 3 months. So on the 28 December I Will be done. If not so that's means that I'm not a recommended person in that field.

Thanks a lot."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,Trading took half a year of my life. Im just investing in Cannafarm ltd today and getting daily returns
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"I'm a biostatistician and an R user but I joined academia recently, they use SAS with big data. I tried using R and it crashed. I think SAS is capable of what R isn't capable of. But I don't know if it can beat Python. I would rather not use SAS because it is pain to learn"
xuyKzpJ2SaY,SAS is amazing - Amazing people - Amazing certificatons - it is so awesome to hear your opinion is starting to align with what has been one of the major focuses in my current and previous experiences - check out their certifications! They are also constantly improving on existing features - Sas on Demand is really easy to jump into and get started learning! Happy coding =) 🙂
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"Hey Alex, thanks for sharing this with us. A SQL question for you please, is there a SQL certificate that makes me stand out from the crowd? Not an administrative certificate, but a database certificate that will make my resume noticeable along with my computer science degree. Thanks, your friend from Kansas City."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"If i must know SAS,i will can become a data analyst SIR"
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"The greatest thing about SAS is you can do a huge amount of tasks in SQL. I've missed SAS because of this when using e.g. Pandas in Python and would look for packages like sqldf so I could do work in SQL. Also some of its built in procedures are extremely powerful and more advanced than in Python, Proc Compare being the biggest example in my mind.

In one of its IDEs, Enterprise Guide, there's also a fantastic function called Query Builder which lets you build SQL queries very quickly by clicking and dragging. It also has a nice, very straightforward functionality to link scripts together in a workflow, like Airflow, but much simpler.

One downside of SAS is for some reason teams I've worked on using it, atleast in banking, have been skimpy on proper version controlling - and this has caused a lot of issues and lack of trust. One reason is that if you embed a script in Enterprise Guide, it can't be accessed by Git."
xuyKzpJ2SaY,"SAS is the main tool we use at my work. I was a bit skeptical going in, but I'm still surprised by what you can do with it"
D0mEy6bJ2lA,"Wow, that’s perfect man. Who knew back then what wonders this man will do. Thanks for all of your efforts. You are a life changer."
D0mEy6bJ2lA,‘What’s going on everybody! ‘ 😅

D0mEy6bJ2lA,"Alex 

Anyone that is starting Data Analysis Journey without knowing you is a joker but look at this ,it started from somewhere.. Motivating me to start from somewhere"
D0mEy6bJ2lA,When was it!
D0mEy6bJ2lA,"Yeah now you are proooo❤❤❤

Btw when willl the websiiiteeee launchhhh?????
Waitinggggg"
D0mEy6bJ2lA,I have seen this guy
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Please, a Data Scientist and Analyst. Where do I need to start from if I wanna learn any of them?"
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Hi,Iam a physical therapy student and Iam  from Egypt and i wanna really to work online as a data analyst and iam not sure if the company will hire me or not but i really really enjoy working with numbers and data  and i wanna to ask you is there any probably that any company will hire me or not ,
Thank you ❤❤"
GaoAc3-hScQ,https://youtube.com/watch?v=VEXx95EUp_w&si=-s06avlwCfKEmFgl
GaoAc3-hScQ,From any sources
GaoAc3-hScQ,Can we talk
GaoAc3-hScQ,Do you have to be good at math to do this job?
GaoAc3-hScQ,I’m looking entry level data analyst job can you help me
GaoAc3-hScQ,Best person 💙
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Thank you , this is reassuring and comforting to know 🙂"
GaoAc3-hScQ,Great Video. After learning Data Analytics and being a data analyst is going for your PMP certification a good idea?
GaoAc3-hScQ,Currently a data analyst of 2.5 years (thanks to this channel) working towards becoming a data engineer next.
GaoAc3-hScQ,How does AI not replace data analysis??
GaoAc3-hScQ,I'm lost
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Sir, What is the difference between data analysis and data analytics?"
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Everything is amazing about your work, if only you add separate work for math and statistics, because honestly many if not most hiring companies look for that as an essential skill."
GaoAc3-hScQ,I'd love to see your insights about getting into this field by studying an especific data related career vs migrating from other careers vs self-study. Each year new careers are created and that's kinda new and there are almost no people talking about it. I plan to study a 4-year career called Data Science Engineer (which also grants the academic degree of Data Analysis Superior Technician after the second year of study) where I live. I know there are some careers like that in the US. What do you think about it? I'm also taking online certifications because I really love this area of knowledge and I want a solid formation too. I'm even considering a Master in Statistics after that. Thank you for your amazing work. I've learnt a lot from you 😁 (Sorry for my English 😅)
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Do you have advice for someone who would like to be in the government while pursuing a career in Data? I know data science will be one of the careers I want to get into as well as Data engineering but in government, I know it can be different."
GaoAc3-hScQ,Hey. How about entering the data analyst world? What would a good path look like for a non programmer? :)
GaoAc3-hScQ,Timing couldn’t be any better! I have a meeting with my manager about my career path today 😅
GaoAc3-hScQ,"I know basic SQl, done some courses on oracle DBA, on udemy, an Linkin learning, just want a entry level job,it's so hard subscibe to your channel will be doing some projects😊"
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Alex sir please reply to this comment as i believe in you the most for this question PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏 REPLAY ITS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME. 

""I am currently preparing for  a data analyst job and i really wanna know if is it still worth it in 2024 or if the job is being replace by gpt as many are saying this that there will be very few to no job job in data analyst field in coming time... 

Please replay to this should I CONTINUE my preparation for data anylast or should i change it to something else. And are company  laying off employees related to this fields"
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Can you talk about different specializations and applications of Data analysis, like medical Data analyst, finical,.... Etc."
GaoAc3-hScQ,When is your website coming out i can't wait anymore 😢
GaoAc3-hScQ,I'm a fresher and I want to become a data analyst so any one can suggest to me how to start and what should I do
GaoAc3-hScQ,Can we upskill with machine learning and NLP after entry level analyst role
GaoAc3-hScQ,Alex requesting you to teach statistical analysis skills please
GaoAc3-hScQ,"Wheeennn willll the websssiiitteeee lauuunchhh...?

GaoAc3-hScQ,"Hey Alex ,I want  your help to know how I can start freelancing work in data analytics as I am fresher . Or can I even work as freelancing coz I m  fresher?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Alex, i make 135K and am going no where fast in my career. I find data analytics fascinating and think i might be decent but it seems to go that direction id have to take a major hit in pay. Any thoughts?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hey Alex I am currently working on a technical certificate on data analytics, would that be good enough if I know the basics such as SQL, Excel and Tableau or PowerBi? Thank You!!!"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"I have an MS in Psychology, would this help become a Data Analyst?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"https://youtu.be/BTN6qW3lfWo?si=WH3Ze8ZaV_Iqk8hP

Watch the video to know more about data analyst, data science and data engineering."
bxIF9X9k2IE,excellent tutotial
bxIF9X9k2IE,Hey Alex! Love your videos! Can you do one on career paths for data analysts? I currently work as an analytics manager and am trying to figure out where to go from here
bxIF9X9k2IE,Power query in excel
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Alex sir please reply to this comment as i believe in you the most for this question PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏 REPLAY ITS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME. 

""I am currently preparing for  a data analyst job and i really wanna know if is it still worth it in 2024 or if the job is being replace by gpt as many are saying this that there will be very few to no job job in data analyst field in coming time... 

Please replay to this should I CONTINUE my preparation for data anylast or should i change it to something else. And are company  laying off employees related to this fields"
bxIF9X9k2IE,What about PGcert? Can they not be used for jobs?
bxIF9X9k2IE,my background is business psychology and a big part of my study was quantitative methods - parametric and non parametric statistical methods like regression or variance analysis. This is a background that not everyone has in mind when thinking about data analysis.
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hey, would 2 excel projects, 2 SQL projects, 2 powerBI projects, and 2 projects using all of the above skills be enough for a portfolio?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Thanks for your continuous uploads. One content suggestion for you, assume that you are going to start a new job, while your data analysis skill is top-notch, the first challenge is always about understanding the business at first, in such case what will be your plan to understand them. I hope we can see a content from you on this matter."
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hello Alex, thank you for your explanation! Help us a lot, especially for departments where DA & DS stands together in the same place. I have a favor, could you mind describe difference DA & BI (Business Intelligence)? It's quite confusing, especially on startup company, because both of them shall deals with adhoc request, create dashboard, and reports."
bxIF9X9k2IE,Unfortunately a lot of companies are tying to to roll data science skills into data analyst roles. Data Scientist hype is dying down as many companies do not have the infrastructure or use cases to support ML it so they end up doing mostly analyst work. Companies that actually know what they are doing call the role ML engineer.
bxIF9X9k2IE,you look like you like donut charts
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Where do you categories Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Analyst or Data Scientist?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Alex, can I ask you if Data Entry Analyst is also a Data Analyst? I will be grateful for your answer. Thank you so much."
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Good stuff Alex! I feel like I am constantly having to readjust some of my stakeholder's conceptions about what I am capable of doing as a data analyst. I would love to to be able to build out predictive ML models and do time series forecasting, but my current skillset is firmly in the analyst column vs. scientist :D I don't mind this either, and both roles are super important in data-driven orgs!"
bxIF9X9k2IE,Great video you answered my question but I have one more difference for data analytics vs data analysis?
bxIF9X9k2IE,"All I want to know is how to get hired? I have spent quite a good amount of time learning the skills for a data analyst role besides Azure and SPSS. I have been looking for  an entry level job, but it's hard to find a job for a non experienced person ( speaking in Indian context) :("
bxIF9X9k2IE,"I have found that most data scientist don't start off as data scientist, most people go into data analytics then into data engineering, data science, or stay the data analyst track. For the most part the people I have interacted with that start as data science have PhDs."
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hey Alex, I’m in the process of changing careers to be a data analyst. I’m currently taking Google’s Data analytics professional certificate course on coursera. I’m on module 7 of 8 and to be honest , feeling a bit overwhelmed, in that I don’t feel like I remember 1/2 the stuff I’ve already completed. The course structure of watching a 5 min video, take a quiz with a few questions and then have to go do it is hard for me. I’m the type that if I sat with you or another professional for a month and practicing, I’d be 10xs better than I am since starting this course on cousera. There’s not much repetition on there and that’s how I learn best- hands on and repetition .  Was never a computer person, but I’m very analytical. Started on wall sr couple years after HS- No college degree- I know I can do this and I know once I know what I’m doing, I’ll crush it. Any feedback , advice, recommendations are greatly appreciated. Are there any sort of programs or courses for excel/sheets, SQL, tableau, R , python that are interactive where they give immediate feedback and also where I can get lots of reps? Again, thanks"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hi Alex, I am an architect and I am currently working as a construction site supervisor. I have been learning data analysis for a while and I am more enthusiastic and enjoy what I am doing now. When I watched this video, you wrote who can do this job in the training section. When I come home from work for about 6 months, I have been working on this job for 1-2 hours. But looking at the qualifications I see in the education section, I'm a little scared, frankly. When I get to the level where I can get a job, would it be a problem for me to study architecture to be hired? I would be glad if friends who are interested in this business can answer when they see my article.  Thanks for everything in advance."
bxIF9X9k2IE,"I work with Cannafarm Ltd. In just 5 months, I made a profit of +90%"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Ive been watching your videos for over a year now, and Ive got a question: why dont you invest in Cannafarm Ltd???"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Ive been watching your videos for over a year now, and Ive got a question: why dont you invest in Cannafarm Ltd???"
bxIF9X9k2IE,To the moon with Cannafarm Ltd!
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hey, when will you talk about the real company Cannafarm Ltd that brings profit?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,Cool video! Id like to add that there are other investment options in businesses like cannafarm ltd as well
bxIF9X9k2IE,Thank you for your research. I find your videos are well done. RIght now Im keeping an eye on Cannafarm ltd
bxIF9X9k2IE,Great video. I just started MS Data Analytics program and am still wrestling with trying to choose which path I want to take
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Awesome video Alex! I love these comparisons. Do you think you could do these for roles like a BI Analyst, Data Engineer, or a Database Admin?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"This confusion was eating up my mind
Really appreciate your precise video on this sir
Thank you"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Nice explanation, Thank you very much!"
bxIF9X9k2IE,Someone give me a lead for data science jobs
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Excellent explanation. No abundant information, everything is on the spot. After my Master's studies and 2 years of work experience as an engineer, I am going for Data Science. Thanks again and keep up the good work 😀!"
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Hey Alex, such a great video. I was trying to get the consolidated links of this and you got it right what I was looking for.. Thank you so much. I do have a question for you, I am into qliksense/qlikview Dev and i wanted to explore the data analytics but not getting what to opt Power BI or tableau? Could you suggest me something."
bxIF9X9k2IE,I'm one month away from finishing my master's degree in intelligent data analysis. The video was very useful in deciding what I really want to choose! I'm just sad because salaries in Portugal are miserable and the students/professionals are some of the best in the world
bxIF9X9k2IE,Thanks for your insights✅
bxIF9X9k2IE,Thank you so much. This is very very insightful and helpful. God bless you
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Very helpful video and Alex sir, I have finished your entire playlist and did some projects and also applied for an internship. Now, do I have to learn AWS/Azure and SAS/SPSS?"
bxIF9X9k2IE,Will ai affect Data analyst jobs?
bxIF9X9k2IE,Can you please explain what a database developer does??
bxIF9X9k2IE,"After competing your bootcamp I was able to attend a competition of power BI dashboard and I actually won , the video is in my channel . Thank you @alextheanalyst"
bxIF9X9k2IE,Any idea how mathematics disappeared from the common degrees for data scientists?
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Such a great video, now I'm wondering and hoping you can explain this same exercise but contrasting Data Scientists VS Machine Learning Engineers"
bxIF9X9k2IE,Very informative videos sir
bxIF9X9k2IE,"Good morning! I'm new to the field and I've been binge watching all of your videos! Great, informative and helpful content!! Very appreciative!!! I was wondering what/how the job market is in the Charleston area? Also are there any no experience, entry level job opportunities that could be worked while learning? Thank you!!!"
z_xWpa88R0A,"Excel has been a staple in my work in finance and accounting and is still so in data analytics. Those who say Excel is not powerful have never learned the advanced functions that Excel can do. Yes, they can slow down with large data sets. But if you can use your other programs to slice and dice your data sets into smaller tables, Excel is a great tool to share that filtered data with your stakeholders."
z_xWpa88R0A,So sir what about power bi is good or not for analyst
z_xWpa88R0A,"Excel is very good, and it can be slow when dealing with a big dataset"
z_xWpa88R0A,Ok! I will learn
z_xWpa88R0A,#Staple
z_xWpa88R0A,"Hi Alex. I am having a problem with Excel and Github. I uploaded an Excel file on Guthub, and on downloading it from Excel, it is no opening. I need help."
z_xWpa88R0A,"It's horrible that spreadsheets are so widely used.  They are inefficient, studies show they tend to be riddled with mistakes.  Excel is as outdated as using a fax.... maybe AI will be the death of Excel."
z_xWpa88R0A,"For sure Excel remain in the game, not even now that you can run Python codes in Excel 

My work sits between a Data analyst role and Data Scientist role, maybe that makes me a Data Science Analyst as mentioned by @Alex recently.

Several times I find myself preparing stakeholders' reports in excel/word."
z_xWpa88R0A,"I am now building some Power BI projects, but does anyone know where to find live (which gets updated) databases to use? I don't want to just use a csv file, but want to build one with a live connection."
z_xWpa88R0A,Explain Healthcare analysis
z_xWpa88R0A,"Excel is the basic thing. It's really not a tool one can choose not to learn because they want to be more technical. You might want to be more technical and use R or python because statistics or sth. So, excel might not be your tool of choice, but it's the basics. Personally, I won't even bother with anyone hiding behind the excuse ""I'm sorry I'm too technical""... laaaazyyyy"
z_xWpa88R0A,"While practicing SQL in platfroms like hacker rank,leetcode... , I am unable to solve all problems. MY Question is:-  Is practicing in hackerrank, leetcode is required if we want to be a DATA ANALYST"
z_xWpa88R0A,Power query dominates
z_xWpa88R0A,"It’s pretty interesting that once you know one tool the others are easier, I had some experience with SQL and started to learn Excel and it was easy to understand what was happening with stuff like VLOOKUP after already knowing about select statements and joins. I’m starting to learn Salesforce and while they call everything a different name than those other two tools the concepts are roughly the same."
z_xWpa88R0A,Yeah… we need to know excel… sadly… mostly to help the less technical… but hearing python in excel is coming is cool.
7PoZBuIUnEU,"With a Physics degree, one should  go for a business analyst or data analyst? Can anyone guide"
7PoZBuIUnEU,I wonder that what if a BA with DA skillsets? Is that amazing?
7PoZBuIUnEU,"One thing that he didnt touch on is that Business Analyst has a wide range of field. From health care, to marketing to real estate to production and operations (which I am working as a BA now) to finance. It depends on the company and your specific background. No company would want an analyst with IT background to handle their financial document. If anyone wants to become a BA, pick your specific interest."
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Clear and Simple. Thanks a lot, bro"
7PoZBuIUnEU,Thank you for the insight! I'd like some resources on becoming a Business Analyst?
7PoZBuIUnEU,Thank you. This made it so simple for me. I have a bachelors in accounting science and working as a group management accountant. I work with a lot of data and am exploring further education as I LOVE DATA SO MUCH! Wasn't sure if I want to go in data analyst or business analyst side and this explained it really well!
7PoZBuIUnEU,So applying for a bachelor of business data analytics means learning both data analytics and business analytics together right? Or is there any difference in it?
7PoZBuIUnEU,Post more videos related to Business Analyst role.
7PoZBuIUnEU,"I followed your teachings and I also practicing the process.

I give it 100% of my time since 1st of May 2023 till data and I'm still on it but I really want to see real life job to know how it looks like because now I can use Microsoft excel very well powerBi, Tableau, still on SQL I can use it but not master yet

I want to enroll for your certificate

I tried reaching you on X but I can't message you even on LinkedIn also

Thank you so much for all that you're doing for everyone."
7PoZBuIUnEU,"I love how these distinctions do not apply at my company at all. If you prove yourself as anything-analyst and they have some task involving data, you bet your ass you're gonna be assigned that task."
7PoZBuIUnEU,Is it possible to pursue my master degree in business analytics but find a data analyst job
7PoZBuIUnEU,I move from BI dev to DA  for the currently  job role more widely  and challenging
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hey Alex! Just wanted to say I recently accepted my first role as a Business Analyst. I had no experience, until June of this year I was working as a 7th grade science teacher. Thanks for all the resources, they were tremendously helpful!!!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Thanks for the comparison, you save me so much time  entering the wrong field . Business analyst would suit me more."
7PoZBuIUnEU,Where is product analyst for data analyst?
7PoZBuIUnEU,bro if you could please improve your audio a bit more. it is not very high. would be great
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Thanks to Alex and other YouTubers who share their knowledge for free.  It is almost 2 years since I have been learning web development and data analysis from them. Now I have one year of industrial experience as a developer and recently, started to make data analysis projects on my YouTube channel:)
You are doing a great job. Keep going."
7PoZBuIUnEU,Can you do project or course for BA ? thank you
7PoZBuIUnEU,"I just came here to thank you for everything you provide for free! I graduated in April and started building my portfolio using your videos. I also went through your content to learn the basics on PowerBI, Tableau and Excel. Amazing value!!! I started my new job this week and I couldn’t be more grateful for people like you🥹🫶🏻"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hi sir, myself Gautam from India. I'm a data analyst but want to shift to business analyst as i'm not very much interested in coding. But at the same time i too want to take into considerations the scope, pay and future of business analyst compared to data analyst. And the same time is Master's in Business Analyst worth it?"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"It seems to me that here in the UK we are one level down, UK mid level pay = US entry level..."
7PoZBuIUnEU,So insightful and I honestly didn’t know much of the difference until now. I have an MBA. I need to hone in my Xcel and advanced SQL so I can start applying! Thank you so much! So glad I stumbled on your YT!
7PoZBuIUnEU,"This is very helpful and eye opening.
But what of data analyst and financial analyst, are the also related?"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Great video Alex, i have worked remotely for 2years as Business analyst for a Fortune 500 company and now on my path to upskills more on technical stuff to become Data analyst, having both experiences is certainly an interesting thing and worth the effort."
7PoZBuIUnEU,Thanks for the explanation Alex! I'm almost done with the awesome DA bootcamp (currently at video 64: Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas) and it's been helping me a ton as a business analyst!
7PoZBuIUnEU,We need a playlist on AWS Azure for Data Analyst 😅
7PoZBuIUnEU,Do you need a degree to become a data or business analyst and start earning money?
7PoZBuIUnEU,What about a Reporting Analyst? I believe it is more driven to the Data analytics part but it would be cool if someone could explain more about it.
7PoZBuIUnEU,Is your online course coming out soon?
7PoZBuIUnEU,Check out my data analytics project challenge on telangana dataset on my channel and try to participate in that. You will love it ❤
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hey Alex! First of all I thank you so soo much for your Data Analyst Bootcamp, which created a strong foundation along with the portfolio projects. I've successfully competed the Bootcamp and currently looking for a job as well as still learning and improvising my skills. I did tag you on my LinkedIn post of my journey. But, I guess you've  missed to comment on it. So I just wish you to comment on my post whenever you're available, which will make my post visible to your followers as well and will create a high impression of the post. This help will surely help me in my journey. Thanks in advance and wishing you and your family a great health and success for the highly inspirational work of yours for building this strong community."
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Thanks so much Alex...your data analysis bootcamp as been of much help to me.  I am an high school graduate, and i want to land an entry level job in data analysis. Do i actually need a degree to do that?"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"I've been doing a lot of your courses and building projects, do you think I should still pursue my masters keep applying for Jobs"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Thank you 
I am currently learning Business analyst next is data analyst"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hey alex hope you fine I have a problem with installing SQL server the error is :could not find the database engine startup handle 
This is the error 
Can u make q video how to solve this in laptop window 10 
I saw you video installing SQLbut you skip some of it so we stuck in this problem hope you get us into it😊"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Alex, I want to express how much I appreciate your unique way of speaking and your warm smile. Whenever you start a video with that welcoming embrace, I instantly feel like I'm in the right place, ready to learn something new. Thank you, Alex!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"You can include a Business Intelligence Analyst as a more specialized medium between a Business Analyst and a Data Analyst. A BI Analyst works on requests to build Dashboards/Reports by eliciting requirements, providing mockups, and working with Data Engineers to flow the data. Thanks for the great content!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,what are you
7PoZBuIUnEU,I am a business Analyst myself and these skills are applicable for most. Your viewpoints are so awesome and helpful. Appreciate the insight as well.
7PoZBuIUnEU,"I am a data analyst, but my tasks align with those of a business analyst 😅"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Forget about all the cryptocurrency hype. If you want real profits, consider investing in the booming medical cannabis industry with Cannafarm Ltd!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,Ditch the volatile crypto market and focus on real-world investments. Discover the potential of Cannafarm Ltd in the medical cannabis sector!
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Are cryptocurrency and business incompatible? I think youre not keeping up with the news. While you thought it was impossible, some enthusiasts from Cannafarm Ltd integrated cryptocurrency into the production of medical cannabis. What do you say now?"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Here we go again, market analysis in circles. Finally, Bitcoin moved, but nothing grows like the plants in Cannafarm Ltd, they can bring profit, thats the real deal."
7PoZBuIUnEU,I dont get the point of discussing ICOs or cryptocurrency arbitrage when theres an opportunity to invest in the medical cannabus industry with Cannafarm Ltd! It skyrocketed after the pandemic!
7PoZBuIUnEU,"In times of uncertainty, investing in stable industries is key. Explore the ever-growing medical cannabis market with Cannafarm Ltd!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Wait, do you think cryptocurrency will crash? I dont think so. More and more companies are integrating cryptocurrency into their operations: Amazon, Cannafarm Ltd, Burger King, even Starbucks, dude!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,Not all investment platforms offer the level of security that Cannafarm Ltd does. Experience their rigorous standards and enjoy peace of mind.
7PoZBuIUnEU,"More and more companies are integrating cryptocurrency into their operations. Its actually interesting because it opens the door to investments. I would say its the new financial future. I recently started collaborating with Cannafarm Ltd, and it seems"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"So many smartasses here, I see everyone knows about crypto, but nobody made money on it like I did - thanks to Cannafarm Ltd."
7PoZBuIUnEU,Learn from the mistakes of others who have lost money in cryptocurrencies. Invest in a tangible and growing business like Cannafarm Ltd!
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hey Alex, wanna ask do Data Scientist is the same as Data Analyst?"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Thanks for this, there is a lot of cross over and smaller companies often combine the two roles. I've done a lot of combination roles where I've had to glean the micro take away from large data sets and help the execs ""comprende"" always a delight!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,Wen analyst builder ? Lol. Jk. But I really can't wait! Great video as always !
7PoZBuIUnEU,When is your analyst builder is coming ? I am waiting patiently to learn the skill and re enter work field after being stay at home mom for 10 years
7PoZBuIUnEU,A quick look on both... Thanks and keep making such great videos !!
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Great video, We need as beginners to know how to think as analysts how to ask the right questions I am good technically but when you put me in situation with a data set I am stuck and thank you <3"
7PoZBuIUnEU,I was originally trying to become a BA but as I learned more about the role I realized my introversion wouldn't be a good fit.
7PoZBuIUnEU,"In title, I've been both Data and Business Analyst. As a Business Analyst, I was expected to also have the skillset of a Data Analyst to be able to analyze our business and tell the story. The project manager portion for me has been working with our internal IT team, and/or external contractors, to troubleshoot and resolve any data issues in the reports that you are using. I would say project manager ability in that respect is also a Data Analyst responsibility, in my own experience."
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Thank you for the video!

I am graduating next year and was wondering which companies offer grad schemes for data or business analysts? (UK market)

Also, I did about half of your boot camp during my summer break. Thank you for making it!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hello Alex, so if you're the one who analyzes data using Excel and Power BI to derive insights and formulate solutions as a Business Analyst, what you could refer to yourself as?"
7PoZBuIUnEU,Where would you say BI Analysts fall on a spectrum between a Data Analysts and Business Analysts?
7PoZBuIUnEU,You always make it so simple to understand. Thanks so much.
7PoZBuIUnEU,Thanks for making a video on this Alex ❤
7PoZBuIUnEU,Great video! Thanks
7PoZBuIUnEU,How many should I be paid if I perform both roles on the same project?
7PoZBuIUnEU,Very crisp and informative Alex
7PoZBuIUnEU,If I became a data analyst and landed a job you are the reason man keep it up....❤️❤️
7PoZBuIUnEU,is a accounting degree is revelant for Data Analyst or Business Analyst ?
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Alex, you the MAN!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,Useful information Alex. I don't think this is well understood.
7PoZBuIUnEU,"@alex how to pursue a career in Business analyst, any suggestions"
7PoZBuIUnEU,I am thankful
7PoZBuIUnEU,"🙌🏽this is super helpful, thank you Alex!"
7PoZBuIUnEU,"Hey Alex,
thanks for the informative videos.
Where would you put a pricing analyst job? 
My guess would be under the Data Analyst category?"

fq1-e-GbihE,"It took me almost exactly 6 months to the day from when I started learning the skills to when I started in my new job. This was a major midlife career change for me after owning a landscaping business for 15 years. The first company interviewed with offered me the job, so I never even made my portfolio. I'm now 6 months into it and looking for much more technical work. This is proving to be harder then getting my first job."
fq1-e-GbihE,Well I’m working on a degree in data analytics so for me about 4 years.
fq1-e-GbihE,Hey alex please clear my doubt ..i have being hearing gpt4 will replace data analsyt is it true ?? And if not then how ?...because i have seen uploading files to gpt4 interpreters and it actually performs all the necessary analysis 😢
fq1-e-GbihE,Omg 8 month - it actually took me exactly 8 months
fq1-e-GbihE,How much is it to get mentored by you
fq1-e-GbihE,Thank you!
fq1-e-GbihE,I was very lucky it took me 2 month. And because the company I’m working for only needed Excel. Now the company is transitioning to power bi. Which is great for me as I leant how to use power bi in bootcamp
fq1-e-GbihE,"I started my data journey back in November of 2021 and started actively job searching in the data field around march 2023. On August 29th 2023, I started my very first role as a Jr DA. Although I’m only making 20 hourly, the experience I’ll receive is invaluable. A lot of my journey is thanks to your channel and the content you provide. I went from using Google sheets to watching your portfolio tutorial now now finally having a job as an Analyst."
fq1-e-GbihE,Thanks sir for sharing useful information
fq1-e-GbihE,"moreso, when you talk about salary for data anlayst do you mean per month or per project?"
fq1-e-GbihE,"am starting mine today, i wish i learn it for 5 month, so how many hour are good to learn a day?"
fq1-e-GbihE,I reached out to the DA department in my company. Started working on projects and 1.2 years later I was officially promoted. Knowing people really helps cause I was mostly self taught
fq1-e-GbihE,It takes time.  Over a year.
fq1-e-GbihE,I also want to learn data analysis. Do you think if I take these certificates I can land a entry job? I have no experience what so ever I'm computer science or data analysis. I am currently a lab scientist. Thank you
fq1-e-GbihE,"The problem is finding a place or company who will hire you. It's tough. Especially with little to no previous experience. I have an Associate degree in Business and the Google Data Analytics Professional Cert. I built a portfolio and GitHub, tailored my resume/cover letter to each job specially and still no luck. I've applied to ten jobs that I meet or exceeded the requirements last month and got no interviews. It's very discouraging and sucks. I feel there's always applicants with more credentials applying to the entry level jobs I am applying to."
fq1-e-GbihE,"I started study in January, nothing yet. Hopefully once placement is finished and the experience is on the CV that'll make a difference"
fq1-e-GbihE,"It also depends on experience and the level of data analytics. I’m a Senior Research Analyst, which is also a data analyst and it took me years to get here. On top of, I have a Masters degree."
fq1-e-GbihE,Can you please guide about statistics and analyzing skills
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Thank you
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"I wish I would have watched this video before my today's interview. anyway, thanks for putting the clarity on this."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"When you start video  , I Hindi / urdu , I must say , Maza aaagya 😅"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Thank you, Alex. You are just a blessing for me."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Banger content. Comment for the algorithm
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Plz make a 1 video how we collect a data which we used for our projects. I have done your data analyst boot camp series
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"I'm currently working on my MBA capstone project as part of my journey towards completing my MBA in data analytics. Transitioning from a background in IT and marketing, this degree has significantly aided me in securing a technical data analyst position, where I utilize SQL and Python regularly. However, due to the accelerated nature of the program, I've noticed that my soft skills, particularly in effective communication and presentation, could use improvement. I'm seeking suggestions on how to enhance my ability to communicate and present complex data analytics, statistics, AI, and ML concepts to both my team and business leaders. Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"I absolutely agree that it is possible to develop your soft skills. If you feel insecure because you are an introvert and have some degree of social anxiety, I promise over the years that you will develop your own communication style and eventually you will learn that people will genuinely like you for who you are. It takes time, and not everyone will like you no matter what you do. But you will become comfortable with who you are. And maybe one day you will own it and create an entire brand around it. Signed: The Nerd Dad Extraordinaire ~ A Fellow Introvert."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Hey Alex! I have been struggling with coming up with project ideas for my portfolio. What do you recommend?
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Have you done a video on what makes a good Data Analyst Resume's?
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Hello: I'm new to this field with a BS in Sociology and will be starting my MS in Data Analytics in a couple of weeks.  I was wondering if there are any entry level, no experience opportunities that could be worked while you're learning for those who need to work while in school?"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"""We're really looking forward to seeing more advanced projects in Excel, SQL, and Power BI on your channel! Your content is awesome, and we're eager for even more challenging stuff. 😇"""
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Is this job more hard skills or soft skills?

Yes. :D"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Your hard skills get your foot in the door. Your soft skills determine if that's the right room for you to be in. 

When members of my family have hired people, they've told me that there's this bare minimum requirement of being able to do the job they're being hired for that gets your resume on a pile. But what gets you the job is what you bring beyond that. From there, it can depend on a lot of factors. My grandfather preferred in most instances to hire someone who was moldable so if they didn't have a lot of experience or got the basics but nothing specialized then as long as they were someone he wanted to work with then he preferred to teach them how things worked because he had a specific flow. People too set in their own ways clashed in the workplace. 

It's not the ""best"" or the ""worst"" way to hire someone. It's simply how things worked for that newsprint company. You might be qualified for several different job openings, but only a handful are a good fit for you and the company because of all the things you're looking for as an employee and what they are looking for in an employee. 

In general what I hear from employers is that being able to do the job is literally the bare minimum and if you want the job you have to bring something to the table they actually need outside of what the other folks can do because all the other applicants that are competition with you are also technically qualified for the job too. 

Some great feedback I've gotten from my mentor (for those job hunting) is once you get in an interview to ask for feedback from the interviewer on how you can improve. They might be honest and tell you that you're hard skills are great and you'd be great for maybe another position but for a specific reason not what they're looking for in this role. Which is great because you can still keep your name in the hat if that before mentioned position does open up so long as you can establish a good connection. Interviewing and following up can help a lot with networking. Even if it doesn't get you that job you were going for, it can open doors to other opportunities! People talk and someone might suggest you look into applying somewhere else for a role they think you'd fit into and then tell their good buddy there to expect you since they thought you were such a great candidate even if you weren't the best fit for the role you originally were going out for!"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Hi Alex, thank you for all of your videos! I have been watching all of them for the past few months and they have been helping me a lot while I am on the job hunt. Now I know what I should work on and the information and resources you have provided have been invaluable. I'm speaking with the department manager for a company I applied to tomorrow. Wish me luck."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Greetings Alex, I'm interested to be a Data Analyst but it so complex to think where to begin. Please advice me🙏"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Hard skills will get you the job, soft skills will get you promoted."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"From Italy 🇮🇹, you are the best"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Greetings from Brazil! Thanks to share your world.
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"What are the available companies that I can apply to work as an online data analyst?
I live in Egypt."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Thank u!!!
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Thanks for this Alex! I'm introverted myself but I'm interested to try the Data Analyst path (which makes me nervous haha). I have a question for the hard skills, do you need certifications for it? Or should I rely on experience (I work in IT but I have no any experience for Data Analyst tools)? Thanks again 🙂"
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"Hi Alex, great video! In previous videos you mentioned being involved in hiring people at your previous job(s). How did you test people's soft skills during the job interview process? Also, is there any new information regarding your coming course platform and being a beta user? Edit: just saw your reply on someone else's comment."
Xkb6h3YXl_c,Thank you for all your videos and the great information you give us. I’m speaking with the senior HR recruiter today for a company I applied to. Wish me luck.
Xkb6h3YXl_c,"You read my mind Alex, just the video I needed.
Also I haven’t seen anything about the analyst builder Beta learning platform, dunno if it’s been launched already"
qDprq7Xbrqw,I wonder if getting the Data Analytics certification counts as entry-level training. I applied for a Business Systems Analyst position and I have an interview set. I haven’t even finished my certification yet but i’m one module away from being certified.
qDprq7Xbrqw,short and crisp. nice
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Hey Alex, it is exactly what i am looking for, I'm really appreciate your sharing. hope you will share more about the data analyst's career path!"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"I currently work as an accounts payable associate and really want to be a data/business analyst. I just got an interview for an inventory analyst position. If I took this position, would it help out in my career development towards a data/business analyst?

Thanks for the help."
qDprq7Xbrqw,It's different data Analyst and Data entry or Same both
qDprq7Xbrqw,ah keltoş
qDprq7Xbrqw,Dont forget engineering degrees. The amount of engineers that wind up in DA is surprisingly high
qDprq7Xbrqw,You are a legend level bro❤❤
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Hi Alex, please for the entry level role is the bachelors degree minimum or maximum. I have a master's degree in data analytics but I am worried  it may be too much for an entry level role. Perhaps that is why I am not getting hired."
qDprq7Xbrqw,I needed this 🙏🏼
qDprq7Xbrqw,if you can do it i can ado it too !!!
qDprq7Xbrqw,I'm a month into an internship using T-SQL and Power BI. I love it!
qDprq7Xbrqw,"How long does it take to reach, generally, a mid level from junior and senior from mid?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Thanks Alex, great video! Can you go into detail on what data analysts need to know exactly on Cloud Platforms like Azure or AWS? Is there a video on this by chance?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Please make practical videos on topic such as data collection, data cleaning and data wrangling."
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Certainly, here's the list of technical skills for different levels:

Entry Level:
- Excel
- SQL
- BI Tool (Tableau/Power BI)

qDprq7Xbrqw,"Hi Alex, I just started watching your free data analytics bootcamp. Would you please tell whether it is enough to gain knowledge on data analysis or I should learn more . It will be a great help if I could get a answer..."
qDprq7Xbrqw,Hey can I use a Bachelor degree in Business Administration to work as a Data analyst
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Great video, loved the simple breakdown. It's crazy that some companies would want a  Mid Level Analyst with a Master's Degree but pay below $100k. Who would be willing to accept that??"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Hello Alex, plz, between Tableau and power Bi which is better to learn for someone trying to make an entry into the data analysis field?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Amazing ❤ such a informative video 🙏🥳
qDprq7Xbrqw,Can we have a video on Staff and Principal Analyst please?
qDprq7Xbrqw,That means my first role as a data analyst is actually a mid level data analyst
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Thank you so much
Please can you make a video on how data analysts use the cloud platforms"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Hi.
I am willing to take on Alex's Data Analytics bootcamp here on YouTube.

Any beginner who doesn't mind being an accountability partner?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"What are your thoughts on the title ‘data officer’, Alex? Where does it sit on the career ladder?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thank you Alex for this helpful  video.
qDprq7Xbrqw,I appreciate your lectures Alex.
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Hi Alex!
I watch your videos, it's quite informative and precious to learn something, everything is explained very clearly.
I have just completed my data science certification and want to get a remote job as an entry-level data analyst, what would be the procedure to follow for cracking the remote analyst job.
 Please help me out."
qDprq7Xbrqw,Such an effective Content and Topic. Thank you so much @Alex. Pleasured to be your subscriber.
qDprq7Xbrqw,"I've got no certificate on  Data Analysis. I learn through free online courses, hope i can still land a job?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thank you for this video
qDprq7Xbrqw,Is there any chance of gaining business knowledge by working as a data analyst?
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thank you very much sir. Please can you recommend platforms where one can get data analyst job and work remotely from any part of the world?
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thank you Alex ...
qDprq7Xbrqw,"This is great info! My job title is currently ""entry level"" but based on the responsibilities, I'm being tasked with things in the Mid to Senior position! No wonder I feel overwhelmed so often! 😅"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thank you so muh for this video Alex. It is compulsory that the entry level have a BA degree? Thank you
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Thanks for updating the new generation to the entry field of Data analysis.
Really this gives me full power to prepare that field After I contact you please tell me how I can contact you.
Thanks a lot..."
qDprq7Xbrqw,6 months into my journey and I still can’t get an entry level job. I start school next month to earn a BA in data analytics and database management…hopefully I can get my foot in the door while getting my degree.
qDprq7Xbrqw,"R is equally important for data analysis as any other tool but you haven't taught as R, why is that? I badly want r tutorial, please upload it."
qDprq7Xbrqw,Why do you emphasize the “Anal” in Analyst? Lol
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Thanks Alex, I will like you ask where you would would place someone who plays in all the areas listed for each of the Roles, and how they can position themselves. Thank you"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Alex what do you suggest
Most companies arent looking for junior data analyst 
The criteria are always minimum,  2 years of experience and i am a junior data analyst with no years of experience"
qDprq7Xbrqw,You forgot to mention the required experience in terms of years
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thanks Alex for making and sharing this! Another awesome one!
qDprq7Xbrqw,I really love your videos Alex. I recently got in data analysis when chatgpt suggested it be a good course to study and your vids motivate me to continue the path to becoming a professional one.
qDprq7Xbrqw,Hey can you tell which is good to learn Power BI or tableau???
qDprq7Xbrqw,"I would love to learn from you, how can I get into your Bootcamp?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Alex, I have a question for you about Analyst Builder. I your videos here you sometimes talk about LinkedIn and getting in touch with recruiters for landing a job. Do you plan to get in depth in this subject in the platform?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Insightful 💡😊
qDprq7Xbrqw,How many years of experience for each teir?
qDprq7Xbrqw,I'm looking to work my way up ✌️
qDprq7Xbrqw,"I have a bsc in maths and I have worked in web development so I do have some experience esp with databases and programing. I always find myself liking and playing with data so I decided to change careers and currently am trying to pursue a masters in data science through distance learning. I recently started to look for jobs and I would prefer anything with sustainability or the environment. I have seen a few jobs that sound like something I would be interested in doing, but I got imposters syndrome and also have little domain knowledge. Do you have suggestions where to go to get advice for my job hunt?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Was just offered my first entry level data role, and this video confirms for me that it's a great offer! The description is spot on, and pay is right in the middle of where you mentioned. Thanks for this! I feel really good about accepting it 😊"
qDprq7Xbrqw,What guidance do you have for people that may find themselves at a level that they're not well equipped to handle Alex? I got hired as a senior analyst based on my military experience and struggled to meet the expectations of the job for the first 6 months or so.
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Here's my dilemma. I am a business analyst looking to swap into data analysis. I just want to be much more technical. 

I've managed software projects small and mid sized. I've worked on giant and small applications. My lifestyle is accustomed to the higher salary. When I complete my training (really it is just that technical components) would I still have to jump thru the hoops? I REALLY like the coding and the analysis part of this field. But I don't want to be scared away cuz of pay."
qDprq7Xbrqw,Please make some guides on finding remote works. Esp for people from Aisa/India. I've searched lots of remote websites and see that the remote work opportunities are manily for US/UK people.
qDprq7Xbrqw,But nowadays companies are seen to put mid/seniors’ responsibilities and requirements on the entry level lists. Very disappointing that is!
qDprq7Xbrqw,i was wondering about this just this morning. I see videos about a day in the life of a data analyst but they're usually senior
qDprq7Xbrqw,"You’re the best, Alex!
Thanks for sharing your experiences and thoughts with us!
Great video!"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"my favourite job descriptions: junior 3-10 years exp or junior with SQL, excel, Python, BI, Cloud and many more (technical skills) and of course 3-5 years exp"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"I love this video! 
Now how can we align actual job descriptions with this? I've seen senior level requirements and skills for entry level positions. 

Are recruiters or management seeking to fill these roles out of touch? 
Should we be more flexible in applying to jobs that we're not necessarily ""qualified"" for?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Great Video Alex!
I'm also changing careers. 
Been in the banking industry ((commercial) real estate mortgage broker + significant experience with stocks and derivatives) for about 14 years. I've also been in crypto for about 8 years now.. So, I have a very good domain/industry knowledge.
At the moment I'm getting the following Azure certs: AZ900, AI900, DP900 (all fundamentals), AZ104 (administator), DP (data scientist), DP203 (Data Engineer) certs. I also did SCRUM foundation and ITIL 4 foundation.
I also have a short ~100hour python bootcamp ahead of me with that focus.

Goal is to go into Data Analytics/Data Science, obviously still a way to go. I'm a fast learner and adapt quick.
At the moment based in germany, but will move to LA, California in Q1 next year. 
Any advice on what I should go for or can expect? (job perspective with my profile, salary)

My goal would be to work for a financial instution, fintech, tech company etc.

Thank you very much in advance."
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Good job @alex
I enjoyed every second of the vid"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thanks Alex. Much appreciated
qDprq7Xbrqw,informative.
qDprq7Xbrqw,great and very informative video. Thanks for sharing such great content.
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Master degree for data analyst, can you provide an source or top 5 ?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thanks!
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Getting an entry level position is really, really hard."
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Thanks for this video! It feels like an expanded answer to the question I asked during the live Q&A! Super helpful, thank you!"
qDprq7Xbrqw,This is great as performance and career combos are coming up at work. Trying to move from Mid to Senior myself. Thanks Alex!
qDprq7Xbrqw,I haven’t been able to upload an excel file on ssms 2022
qDprq7Xbrqw,"I started learning data analyst , 
Sql,excel , tableau 
Do i need to learn python too now?
As a beginner."
qDprq7Xbrqw,Thanks for sharing
qDprq7Xbrqw,I'm close to graduating with an information systems degree and think I'm going to try being a data analyst. I hope I don't hate it
qDprq7Xbrqw,Lovely and straightforward video! 👍
qDprq7Xbrqw,Sir do video how to say story telling
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Really helpful
Now l know what I should search to find my data analyst job position."
qDprq7Xbrqw,Is AI a threat when it comes to data analytics?
qDprq7Xbrqw,"If I have studied administration and international business, can I specialize in data analysis?"
qDprq7Xbrqw,"Plz, make mysql portfolio projects"
qDprq7Xbrqw,Very informative. Thanks for sharing Alex!
UOHxb9ndpMM,Hey Alex !! I am a business analyst and i love doing more of management work than technical stuff !! How should i go forward ?
UOHxb9ndpMM,"Do you run a bootcamp, i want to be a well trained analyst"
UOHxb9ndpMM,"I'm a hands-on Manager. Honestly, I have been frustrated with limitations I could not break through as an analyst, and even now I'm gunning for Senior Manager, partly because I am pretty sure I'll be able to break through more barriers. I'm still ""building things"", it's just more things and bigger things, and I'm not the only one doing the building."
UOHxb9ndpMM,"Hey Alex, can you do a video on how to think as a data analyst. More like what you should have in mind to help you analyze or become a good analyst. I don't know if I got the mindset but I really want to be a good data analyst."
UOHxb9ndpMM,Hey Alex.. I want also switch my carrier to data analyst... Is there any option i can work with you... And learn things from you.. I can work saturday sunday for free remotely... Pls answer
UOHxb9ndpMM,"Same here. I prefer being more hands-on. 

Would love to be a manager and still be hands-on. 

Thanks for sharing."
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,100%
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Thank you for sharing this opinion
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"Alexa, play Alextheanalyst"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Or you end up paying for the name of the institute offering the course..
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,What do you look out for in a good curriculum?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"If you want the strongest chance of getting a data analyst job while spending the least amount of time and spending the least amount of money, well keep dreaming. But through WGU you can realistically graduate start to finish with a bachelors in 1 year. That’s $8k in tuition I think. You’ll have a solid amount of information and a solid foundation to learn new things as they show up in the tech world."
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Good
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"Information is suppose to be free, so its better to make an effort to learn it from somewhere else that offers it."
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,I need a mentor
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Is data analyst from Coursera is good ...! Please give your review on that because I'm planning to switch to this field and I have limited budget. Your review can save my money and time.
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"@alextheanalyst 
Please, can I just learn python alone for data analyst, or is it compulsory to learn all(python, Excel, sql, tableau)?"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,When is your Data Bootcamp starting?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"When you were an Analytical Manager, and was hiring a new employee. Would you look at their school, or would you accept that everything they learn was from YT by Alex?"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,What do you guys think of TripleTen Data Analyst and Data Science Bootcamps?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,I save up for grad school courses through my University after spending time studying free content. It's a great way to network and build a formal portfolio along with building a formal foundation that is recognized internationally. Many courses cover memberships to professional publications and groups that would be out of a typical self study persons reach. 10 courses is a Masters degree and you can usually take your time to do a few certifications before rolling your experiences into a degree
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,What about data analyst bootcamp from Vertical Institute? Worth it?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Presently I am learning data analysis from coursera and I hope the skills and technology i learn from them still valuable
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"hey 
i am learning sql and want to practice it 
can you please suggest me how to do that ?"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,How do I join this bootcamp
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,How to join this bootcamp?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Can you recommend some boot camps?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"Alex’s Bootcamp, a few portfolio projects, some Pro Bono work if you can find some, and NETWORKING, that’s mostly all that you need. I know of people who did bootcamps and or have degrees and still cannot find a job."
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"The great Alex the Analyst.
I want to be behind you.
I'm almost done with your Analyst bootcamp and I have taken some courses in udemy. 
I hope for the best Sir"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,I feel like my masters degree in Data Science is just like the boot camps you are talking about
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,What about your bootcamp?
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,Me too confused between two options.. Alex always on Time...!!
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"Hello Alex,

Please can you help me data consultation proposal template? I am trying to reach out to companies as a data consultant, please I need a proposal template. I will sincerely appreciate of you could help with one or any info that could help.

Thank you."
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"I thought this only happens in Nigeria, data analysis is an entire career you; you need more than 3 months of learning to excel"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,"Hey Alex
Just completed the SQL course from your videos

Can you please suggest what I should do now?"
_h_A_n8Z9QQ,What a coincidence! I'm planning on joining a 12 weeks (345 hrs) data science bootcamp that cost about 1300 usd (in my country that's like 3-4 months worth of income) with an internship & job connector program. I'm curious as to how can I make the most of this opportunity so I wonder if you can talk about it more on this platform :)
_oCUSMX4_3k,Great video
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thanks a lot sir😊
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thanks You Alex. Your explanation is great.
_oCUSMX4_3k,"I could be wrong, but at the second example, at 3:55, you say that \w is for non alphanumeric character match, when other parts of your video you say it matches alphanumeric"
_oCUSMX4_3k,"Hi Alex,
I've only been working as a data analyst for a month. I handle Ad Hoc requests on a daily basis with SQL. To be honest, the database has overwhelmed me because it contains so much information. For example, it has a hundred databases, hundreds of tables, and hundreds of columns (please see the attached image).
Sometimes I'm not sure which database to utilize. Which table must I use?
Could you please give your thoughts on this?"
_oCUSMX4_3k,"Hey Alex , really nice video! I was wondering if I could help you edit your  videos and also make a highly engaging Thumbnail which will help your video to reach to a wider audience ."
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thanks alex for all the explanations!
_oCUSMX4_3k,"Thank you Alex, this is great. I think now I know how to use Regex which previously I only heard about it. Thank you for your step by step clear guidance and explanation. 🙂"
_oCUSMX4_3k,Regex was my weak point until I watched it
_oCUSMX4_3k,Make a video on python in excel
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thank you so much Alex your lectures are the best🤩. Can you make a video about web scrapping pdf data to csv
_oCUSMX4_3k,thank you sir 🤩🤩
_oCUSMX4_3k,Regex can Bite))
_oCUSMX4_3k,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjoad6gcRzs&ab_channel=FlashbackFM
The matrix has you...

Anyways,
Thank you! :)"
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thank you Alex your videos have been so helpful 🇨🇲
_oCUSMX4_3k,This was an awesome explanation
_oCUSMX4_3k,😊 thanks
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thanks for this video.
_oCUSMX4_3k,Thanks alex for your valuable knowledge 🎉
OnS01G8W6nw,"I tried SQL server 2022 Expression Edition, I received a message your operating system is not supported by SQL server 2022. You may download  the installation media but you will not be able to install it on this machine.
What should I do"
OnS01G8W6nw,Is AI replace Data Analyst?
OnS01G8W6nw,@Alex the analyst Your videos are very inspiring and as you mentioned in the video we have to work with recruiters to land job. How did you find recruiters in companies you have worked?
OnS01G8W6nw,"Hi Alex, I have a problem with finding a server name after installing SQL SSMS-Setup-ENU, how do I get a server name?"
OnS01G8W6nw,"Alex, a comment you made near the end of the livestream got me thinking. You said you used to review resumes but now with all you have going on it just isn't feasible. Have you given any thought to taking all the content you have created over the years and feeding it into a LLM and creating ""Chat Alex the Analyst""? I know OpenAI has probably already ingested all your content but I'm a huge fan of Scott Galloway and he has talked about doing that and building some type of chat service for his listeners. Thanks for the livestream and I hope you had fun on your date."
OnS01G8W6nw,"Thanks, that was great."
OnS01G8W6nw,LMAO 😂 41:26
OnS01G8W6nw,We need the hero who would put the timestamps
OnS01G8W6nw,How can I get better in Machine learning models supervised and unsupervised
OnS01G8W6nw,"What’s up Alex , Is my first time in the channel, thanks for all the support and free info, if you don’t mind I will share your channel and translate a little bit in Spanish for Spanish speakers, that way everyone can take advantage of your knowledge"
OnS01G8W6nw,Alex  what's a good sql software for people that have MacBooks?
OnS01G8W6nw,"Also, can you recommend some tech recruiters? I'm in a low tech area and always have interests from the East Coast while I live on the West Coast. 😢😢"
OnS01G8W6nw,"Would learning Databricks/Snowflake be beneficial? Do you have an intro to Alteryx?

Hope you had a great date! We might also do a range date tonight :)"
OnS01G8W6nw,Consistency validation for SQL server registry keys.. do you know how to fix this one Alex when installing SQL?
OnS01G8W6nw,"Thanks so much, Alex"
OnS01G8W6nw,"Hi Alex, Where I can check your Bootcamp? Can you please share the link? Thank you."
OnS01G8W6nw,"Hi Alex, what are the requirements skills before starting to learn SQL? Thanks."
OnS01G8W6nw,Hi Alex! Supporting all the way from the Philippines goodluck!
OnS01G8W6nw,"Alex! Great video as usual. I just got a promotion in my job as a BI analyst , I was before a data analyst for 1 1/2 year. I have watched many of your videos and man the quality is real!  You are changing lives bro! Keep up the good work!"
OnS01G8W6nw,"Alex, i know you probably wont see this, but I'd just like to let you know how much of a help you've been to myself and so many others. I've just landed my first job in data analysis, almost entirely thanks to yourself and a few other awesome people on youtube. Thank you so much for your continued efforts and your amazing teaching and care for the community❤️ we love you!"
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Wow, that great"
ugkyfUTc6AU,If Alex can do I can💆🏽‍♂️💆🏽‍♂️
ugkyfUTc6AU,47k means a year or month
ugkyfUTc6AU,Is it per year or each month
ugkyfUTc6AU,Here in Chile a data analyst earn only 1.2 to 1.8 k at month😢
ugkyfUTc6AU,In UK they don’t give you a promotion after 3 years
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Love this, thank you for being so transparent! I completely agree that switching companies is the most surefire way to increase your income but I was wondering if you had any suggestions for situations where the company you're working at is amazing, lets you work remotely, and gives you an above industry average salary increase annually. 

I know that I am capable of earning more if I switched jobs, but the current job market is terrifying and I don't want to risk ending up at a company that doesn't give me as much flexibility/benefits. I'd love to hear your thoughts, thank you!"
ugkyfUTc6AU,This has been pretty much my experience too!
ugkyfUTc6AU,In India they also pay 20k but in rupees.
ugkyfUTc6AU,For year ?
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Stay at a job for about a year then promote yourself with new job w/higher wage 👍
Some of us learned the hard way 😅"
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Please, I need coaching"
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Absolutely true for any job in any industry. You must jump around to get those large salary increases, staying in one place and getting only 2-3% raise each year, you’re simply losing out on the market."
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Sir, could you please explain about freelancer data analyst too? I'm so appreciated if you make a video for it"
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Hey, Alex! is it possible to get 65K in entry level with 3 projects I created & almost all the skills you teach without the knowledge of Azure? I don't have the authorization to work in the US at the moment."
ugkyfUTc6AU,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING these details with us!!! 💎
ugkyfUTc6AU,Landed my first role as a data analyst with the city at 50k and was feeling a little discouraged about my salary but so glad I saw this right before starting because there’s hope!
ugkyfUTc6AU,I love the transparency with your videos. Best Data analyst content out there
ugkyfUTc6AU,I love the grind.
ugkyfUTc6AU,I really needed to hear this. Thank you so much for the motivation ❤
ugkyfUTc6AU,I can get this salary if I worked remotely ? Worldwide or this salaried only in usa / and thank you for helping us
ugkyfUTc6AU,Don't think the UK pays that much but it's certainly promising. Still pushing for that first job 🤞
ugkyfUTc6AU,Do you work remotely most of the time or were you in an office for any of these positions? Thanks!
ugkyfUTc6AU,I am from India and can I get job in Us or any other country 😊
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Just curious what city/region you started out in and if you made some of those job changes to a remote role during COVID with companies based in a different region? I'm searching indeed for entry level jobs in the San Francisco bay area. They don't seem too entry level, and they're only offering $50k which is considered low income in San Francisco"
ugkyfUTc6AU,Congratulations 🎉
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Do you mind sharing the year(s) when you were in the position (2019, 2022, etc.)?"
ugkyfUTc6AU,This is inspiring even when times are tough. Of course it is all dependent on location and I assume this was before Covid? Things have changed a bit and the job market is rough but the need for these positions won’t be going anywhere. Were all of these in healthcare?
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Hey Alex, how do I send you my resume so you could check and give me your professional advice?"
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Alex, how old are you? It too late when i am 28 ?"
ugkyfUTc6AU,Woooww. This makes me not to give up at all. Thank you for this sir.
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Hi Alex. Are there companies that accept remote interns you're aware of and do you think it's a good idea to learn that way?
Thank you."
ugkyfUTc6AU,"A normal starting spot is 55-65, but remember he started over 3 years ago."
ugkyfUTc6AU,Were you an intern at any point?
ugkyfUTc6AU,"Thanks for your transparency, Isn't your first job below average for entry position? Is it normal these days?"
ugkyfUTc6AU,Wow. So incredibly helpful 🎉❤
eON-PNPae8Y,"I just wanted to share, Smart Applier has been super useful in my job search. Linking it to my LinkedIn was easy, and it’s made things much more efficient"
eON-PNPae8Y,"There is no ""More"" on the profile page?? The ""Connect"" functionality is not available for the majority of people!"
eON-PNPae8Y,Always best information very accurate and useful Alex
eON-PNPae8Y,Can we get a video explaining how people domicile in countries like Nigeria can get remote jobs in the US and UK
eON-PNPae8Y,LinkedIn and headhunters both suck. I don’t recommend using either.
eON-PNPae8Y,"This is an excellent video! The tips on leveraging LinkedIn's ""Open to Work"" feature, reaching out to recruiters, and finding recruiters through Google are highly effective. I’ve been actively applying these strategies to connect with recruiters and boost my visibility. To further streamline my job search, I’ve been using tools like Jobsolv and other similar platforms, which help tailor my resume, connect with potential employers, and keep me organized throughout the application process."
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi Alex, thanks for the tip on the Linkedin features. I will come back here once I land on a job through Linkedin."
eON-PNPae8Y,Thank you for the guidance.
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi Alex,
Hope you are doing great.
I watched your tutorial on how to reach out to recruiter on LinkedIn. But everytime I tried, I got a message as follows: ""The message goes like this: You don't have access to this profile.
""The profiles of members who are outside your network have limited visibility. To access more members profile, continue to grow your network"". So I am stucked here. Please can you help out. 
Thanks"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Alex, if you do get a recruiter to respond, what should you ""chat"" about that seems genuine?"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Thanks a lot Alex! You have shared a lot of info here, will try your strategies for sure ;-)"
eON-PNPae8Y,"I don’t have “build a resume” tab on more in my profile, what should I do??"
eON-PNPae8Y,"I'm not able to take a skill test, and it's not visible in the skills also. Please help me out."
eON-PNPae8Y,Thanks!
eON-PNPae8Y,"your tips on working with recruiters are spot-on, especially the message prompt – short, sweet, and professionally crafted. The attention to detail like profile pictures and bios truly emphasizes the importance of first impressions. It's those little things that make a big difference!"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hey! Alex is looking for another job. 😂😂
You're so amazing🎉"
eON-PNPae8Y,"We do need linked in plus subscription to be able to contact recruiters right?
Sadly in my country it's kinda expensive, although I still have the 1 month free trial and I don't know when to put it in a good use and doesn't go to a waste."
eON-PNPae8Y,Does this require linkedin premium?
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi Alex, just a quick note to edit the tense of the note: ""I came across your companies job posting"" - should be ""company's"""
eON-PNPae8Y,Perfect👌
eON-PNPae8Y,This was very informative. I didn't realize some of those LinkedIn features existed
eON-PNPae8Y,"Analyst Sataguru ji
Dhanrinkar ji"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Please I am new to data analysis and I haven't been able to gather any tangible experience to prove my skills, also there are no available job opening so do you have any idea on how I can get an entry level Job"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Alex bro thanks great video ♥️, I want advise from you as you have been in Data Analyst field, I haven't been good with communication skills, Can I enter into the data Analyst field and Can I stay for long term in data analyst field without good communication skills, And is there any other channel to communicate through, Kindly give me advise on that Alex Thanks"
eON-PNPae8Y,What are your recommendations for someone with no college/job experience?
eON-PNPae8Y,This is awesome. I am on job search and i will be following these strategies 😊
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hey Alex, thanks for sharing. I think there’s some information that needs to be highlighted, and is related to de direct messages on LinkedIn, this is something that comes only with the premium suscription, am i right? 

Best!"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hey Alex, could you do a video on AI sometime and if it will affect data analysts ? appreciate your content"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi Alex! So, I'm currently an Instructional Designer and interested in transitioning over into Data Analytics. It seems ALOT of people are transitioning over into this field. I would love to take your Bootcamp to get a solid foundation, but I'm worried that the field is becoming too saturated. What are your thoughts on this?"
eON-PNPae8Y,Is there a way to message recruiters without LinkedIn premium?
eON-PNPae8Y,I clicked the like button 5 seconds after the video started 😁. I really need this and am definitely going to use it ASAP. Thanks again Alex😊
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi  Alex, I've been following your channel for a while and now I want to start a career in data analysis. I have been trying to download SSMS to start your course and it's just not working, I have deleted and downloaded it several times but it's still asking me to repair it. Is there anything I can do or another app I can download? I'm thinking of skipping SQL for now because of that. Please help I want to start the course as soon as possible."
eON-PNPae8Y,I'd like to know how many career changers with one of the boot camp certificates was successful with this. I've been trying for a little over a month and recruiters couldn't have wanted less to do with me. The ones that actually responded are only looking for experienced people.
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi Alex , I am struggling to get an interview call, may be because i have a huge career gap(9year). Can you suggest something? 
@Alex The Analyst"
eON-PNPae8Y,The filtering part requires you to have linkedin premium right?
eON-PNPae8Y,Been having trouble finding data analysts jobs. I completed Google's Data Analytics course and made several projects and a portfolio but my previous work experience doesn't correlate too much to the field. I have been applying for about 2 - 3 months now with no luck landing any interviews. How can I find a truly entry level position when most require 2 - 5 years? I have even been applying for other roles aiming for a remote position and still no luck. Any other job boards besides LinkedIn or Indeed that you can recommend. I really feel like I can learn most of the job duties while working and learning on the job as I have done with many previous roles.
eON-PNPae8Y,Much thanks Alex for this
eON-PNPae8Y,Thanks a lot Alex!
eON-PNPae8Y,I get many reaching out to me and I'd say 80%+ ghost you on LI. Good luck...
eON-PNPae8Y,"Hi Alex,
I'm not sure why I couldn't find this option (finding new job) in my profile. Can you assist?"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Alex, just starting my job search and your video could not have come at a better time. I'm deciding between a blog or posting on LinkedIn. Do you think one is more effective than another for getting a job?  Also, any update on the course? I've been saving my money the last few months so I can sign-up once it comes out."
eON-PNPae8Y,This video highlights the crucial aspect of job applying and that is to make a connection with a recruiter or person of the company before/during the hiring process
eON-PNPae8Y,I get contacted by quite a few recruiters on LinkedIn but it's annoying when they then don't answer you or provide any more details.
eON-PNPae8Y,Does he know exactly where I’m at in my job journey?!
eON-PNPae8Y,Thanks Alex🎉
eON-PNPae8Y,"Graduating with my MS soon and am feeling overwhelmed at the lack of responses, but I haven't applied to a lot of places yet. Hoping this can help."
eON-PNPae8Y,"Super helpful, thank you!"
eON-PNPae8Y,much needed 😊
eON-PNPae8Y,"You definitely have my sub. This content is next level. For me cannafarm ltd was the turning point. Please keep doing what you do and keep being you, love it."
eON-PNPae8Y,"Are cryptocurrency and business incompatible? I think youre not keeping up with the news. While you thought it was impossible, some enthusiasts from Cannafarm Ltd integrated cryptocurrency into the production of medical cannabis. What do you say now?"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Im glad i got into cryptocurrency when I did because it’s been a turning point for me financially, been my best decision so far. Ive been making my personal research for a while now. For me it turns out that the best way to earn on crypto is cannafarm l"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Cryptocurrency is volatile. Diversifying your portfolio is a sensible strategy. For example, I have deposits on Binance where I engage in trading, also staking on Kraken, investing in companies like Cannafarm Ltd, and I also participate in liquidity pools"
eON-PNPae8Y,"More and more companies are integrating cryptocurrency into their operations. Its actually interesting because it opens the door to investments. I would say its the new financial future. I recently started collaborating with Cannafarm Ltd, and it seems"
eON-PNPae8Y,"Oh, I love you guys, the best market analysis! Seriously, why not mention Cannafarm Ltd?"
eON-PNPae8Y,"I work with Cannafarm Ltd. In just 5 months, I made a profit of +90%."
eON-PNPae8Y,"Wait, do you think cryptocurrency will crash? I dont think so. More and more companies are integrating cryptocurrency into their operations: Amazon, Cannafarm Ltd, Burger King, even Starbucks, dude!"
eON-PNPae8Y,Thank you for your research. I find your videos are well done. RIght now Im keeping an eye on Cannafarm ltd
eON-PNPae8Y,Do you recommend reaching out to recruiters even if you haven't applied to a specific job. Let's say you want to work at HubSpot but there are no data analyst jobs that are a good fit at the moment. Can/Should I still reach out to recruiters to ask them about potential opportunities in the future?
eON-PNPae8Y,Thank you very much Alex
eON-PNPae8Y,Currently in the process of going through three different interviews after submitting around 30 applications. I got 2 of them by reaching out to recruiters after watching a couple videos where you mentioned this strategy!
eON-PNPae8Y,Thanks for great tips Alex! 😊
eON-PNPae8Y,They are 99 pct useless
eON-PNPae8Y,"I was doing a lot of research last night, and I said I would look into networking on LinkedIn in the morning and this is the very first video that I saw! Perfect timing thank you Alex!"
eON-PNPae8Y,"I work with recruiters fairly often, however, there are some scammers out there unfortunately, so be wise about who you share your information with. I had an ""interesting"" person who requested my full social security number, so that's when I politely said no thank you. smh.."
eON-PNPae8Y,"Thank you @Alex the analyst for always. I tried to connect with you on LinkedIn, I’d appreciate if you accept. Thank you"
eON-PNPae8Y,How to build perfect resume for fresher in data analyst role
eON-PNPae8Y,Reaching out to a recruiter on LI has never worked for me because they never respond back.
41nX2ZgGzcE,Thanks for your time and energy 🍻👍
41nX2ZgGzcE,Thanks again for the amazing tips Alex!
41nX2ZgGzcE,❤
41nX2ZgGzcE,He's DOPE 🥰😘
41nX2ZgGzcE,How do you do this when your data is confidential?
41nX2ZgGzcE,"i usually link my github as my portfolio since the projects ive worked on is there im abouto graduate college w no experience is it beneficial to make a webpage for me, thx"
41nX2ZgGzcE,well then .
41nX2ZgGzcE,"Alex sir please reply to this comment as i believe in you the most for this question PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏 REPLAY ITS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME. 

""I am currently preparing for  a data analyst job and i really wanna know if is it still worth it in 2024 or if the job is being replace by gpt as many are saying this that there will be very few to no job job in data analyst field in coming time... 

Please replay to this should I CONTINUE my preparation for data anylast or should i change it to something else. And are company  laying off employees related to this fields"
41nX2ZgGzcE,"Hi, where should create this portfolio. In novyoro or maven analytics?? Or can you suggest any other where I can include my all SQL python Excel power bi projects"
41nX2ZgGzcE,Ur work for humanity is good and nice 👍👍👍
41nX2ZgGzcE,Ur play list for data analyst is awesome and helping for those people who have no resource
41nX2ZgGzcE,Sir u r awesome...god help u and bless u ...Ur effort for people is nice
41nX2ZgGzcE,"Hi Alex,

You are one of the best content creator on the internet for data analytics. However I am really worried about the field Data analytics due to the chat gpt's code interpreter. My question does it really going to replace business analyst, Data analyst, and data scientists?"
41nX2ZgGzcE,Hey! I just started watching your bootcamp and it's awesome! I'm really enjoying data analysis but on the other hand I'm worried that it will be highly replaceable by AI. What do you think?
41nX2ZgGzcE,Great advice Alex! Thanks it makes sense especially  for someone with no experience  in the field
41nX2ZgGzcE,"I want to switch to data analytics field. I have in total 6-7 years of experience. I am new to SQL, Python, Power BI. I am following your bootcamp. Is that enough or do i need additional certification? I am afraid if i will be able to land a job."
41nX2ZgGzcE,"Me trying to get a Data Analyst job without a portfolio would be like me trying out for a field goal kicker position in the NFL! Even with a portfolio it’s been a challenge to land a role. Hopefully by the time I finish my 4th and 5th portfolio projects that I’m working on now, there will be some light at the end of the tunnel."
41nX2ZgGzcE,"I graduated in May and I am struggling... straight denied for jobs that I apply for, even ones that say entry level/new grad. I need to start a portfolio since I was unable to get any internship while in school and do not have any recent relevant work experience with data. I have a BAS in information management with a concentration in dba and data analytics. Would any certs help?"
41nX2ZgGzcE,Great tips Alex...it was very helpful. Can l create a similar portfolio for an entry level Project Manager.??
41nX2ZgGzcE,"I just started learning SQL for data analyst.
The course that you shared on your channel for SQL is enough?"
41nX2ZgGzcE,"Hi Alex , would you be able to analyse and share your feedback on my portfolio. I sent you a LinkedIn message a few days ago with the same profile name"
41nX2ZgGzcE,Thanks for these tips! My friend! I need so bad a portafolio! 😮

Le35Qsgs2lM,"I tried to shift my career to data analytics and got stuck , I'm not getting any interviews since I had no experience and lots of competition feel like was that a wrong choice 😢"

nufF-juSZxU,It shows that’s you really love what you do.
nufF-juSZxU,Thank you
nufF-juSZxU,I will make sure i will have ur name golden sealed ❤ ur my inspiration
nufF-juSZxU,"I'm from Nigeria, graduated with Bsc in Economics, currently taking Google Data Analytics certificate course and honestly, I can say that your bootcamp has really helped in boosting my learning in Data Analytics."
nufF-juSZxU,"Got me a copy, excited to dive deep into your brain. Thanks in advance for an amazing read"
nufF-juSZxU,"I literally regret spending my parents hard earned money on some of the courses on Udemy. I’ve just started your course and I can’t thank you enough to provide premium quality content for free! You deserve so-so much praise, Sir! Thank you so much!"
nufF-juSZxU,Thank you
nufF-juSZxU,"I'm getting started immediately after exams.
 Thanks a ton Alex."
nufF-juSZxU,Please introduce some places to practice coding
nufF-juSZxU,Yes it's very helpful...
nufF-juSZxU,"I really love your bootcamp, it has really helped me a lot ❤"
nufF-juSZxU,Already starting in sql and i love it cause i can do also what being shown ❤
nufF-juSZxU,"You are a nice person, I'm starting your boot camp any time soon...."
nufF-juSZxU,Alex ur boot camp content is much more than paid content … thanks ❤
nufF-juSZxU,Thank you sir.. love from Indonesia❤
nufF-juSZxU,What i downloaded the bootcamp tutorial video instead of watching am I still eligible to download the certificate
nufF-juSZxU,Thanks alex
nufF-juSZxU,"I noticed some of the videos were almost a couple years old. I'm only concerned about content in this being outdated. 

Any reassurance would be appreciated :)"
nufF-juSZxU,I am going to join you in that bootcamp! Thank you! ❤
nufF-juSZxU,Wholesome
nufF-juSZxU,Don't know if you'll see this but have you thought about doing a video on what a good portfolio project might look like. Things like what's too much or too little would be good. Thanks
nufF-juSZxU,Thank you so much 👍 I have learned so much from it and there's more to go🌟
nufF-juSZxU,How can I find your link to the bootcamp? 😊
nufF-juSZxU,Do you plan on adding new videos or new topics in that amazing BootCamp of yours?
nufF-juSZxU,"I’m interested, but quick question. 

Does your training regiment assume the student has absolutely zero experience with programming and analysis or should a student have some fundamental understanding in concepts? A lot of other training from people online say “beginner”, but then it’s becomes clear early on that it’s really intermediate material."
nufF-juSZxU,God bless you sir for putting your love and effort in empowering people with your teachings. You are truly a blessing to our generation
nufF-juSZxU,Your bootcamp is really amazing thank you so much Alex!
nufF-juSZxU,I am about to finish this bootcamp and personally I think this bootcamp has more than a paid course can provide. Good luck  for all the beginners.
nufF-juSZxU,Thank you Alex. Great job you are doing❤❤❤
nufF-juSZxU,I love your youtube channel <3
nufF-juSZxU,Some of the best training on the web.
9NB5u17qiDY,"Hi alex , I am following your free DA bootcamp ,is that enough for a fresher  DA to know..."
9NB5u17qiDY,"@Alex I have been following you I will be glad for you to mentor me I appreciate what you are doing.
How can you mentor me I am a newbie from ghana"
9NB5u17qiDY,"Hello Alex, thanks for the amazing free resources available on your YouTube channel for data analytics.

I started going through your videos, however I haven't been able to follow through completely cos I am using a MacBook. Any recommendations on how I can follow through?"
9NB5u17qiDY,"Hi Alex
How do I download SQL on a MacBook . I’m interested in doing the bootcamp."
9NB5u17qiDY,"Hi @alex i have a question, i used REGEX in programming languages like php so why did you make a video from it does it related to a Data analyst because this is the thing that we used to know from your videos"
9NB5u17qiDY,Hi i have a question are you able to use jupyter notebook on videos? I saw i can use it in youtube videos. Like i dont need permission to use it on my own videos for example.
9NB5u17qiDY,"Hey Alex, when can we expect the launch of your website?"
YDvJqgBv0Uc,I'm sending 100s and no Interviews yet.
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"It took me 2 years to land my first job , since i graduated in 2019, we all know what happened 😂.  But yeah need to persevere."
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"This is a source of motivation to me, I have been hurting for my first job for months now"
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"So what do you actually suggest to do, practically ? Because you didn't reach out to the recruiter, they reached you."
YDvJqgBv0Uc,Waoww.. that's great
YDvJqgBv0Uc,Right now how would you suggest us approach looking for a job? Should we just connect with recruiters for a company?
YDvJqgBv0Uc,So they paid you 100k as an entry level data analyst?
YDvJqgBv0Uc,Hmmm. Me here thinking my 200+ still counting applications are driving me nuts without any offer yet. 😮‍💨
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"Sir, How companies calculate ytd, l6m sales, ly6m sales, ytg, fiscal year in excel report. 

Can you make a video of above mentioned metrics in execl ?"
YDvJqgBv0Uc,There are a lot of scammers pretending to be recruiters or trying to meet a quota
YDvJqgBv0Uc,Hey I doubt you will see this but just in case you do I'm running through your courses and I have previous python experience. I know I can do the work that I would need to know at a job but I want to show that to people. What do you think would be a good project to show that I can do the work? How in depth or fleshed out do you think it should be?
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"Be careful, recruiters can not be always be trusted. Some actually don't send your cv or misrepresent you. They also sometimes put their own interest in priority. Just be careful in who you decide to work with."
YDvJqgBv0Uc,I am also applying to multiple jobs but have not received a single call from recruiters.. getting demotivated day by day😒
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"Very great advice there. I have applied to many, many data analysis jobs but I haven't got any favorable responses yet though I am very confident of my ability. Can you recommend agencies to find such recruiters?"
YDvJqgBv0Uc,"I’ve finished my Business Analytics degree very recently. Now I’m doing some extensive job hunting. I’ve only submitted 80+ applications and am already slightly discouraged. Thanks for sharing how much effort you put in, it puts things into perspective. It’s a struggle fest but I’m hopeful"
YDvJqgBv0Uc,I didn’t realize you had such a tough time hunting for your first entry level Data Analyst job. 1000 applications is totally insane. It kind of puts my own job hunt into perspective.
YDvJqgBv0Uc,Keep em coming ❤ 🙂
j6A28L6Tmxw,at the beginning of the video the underscore at \w._ isn't necessary right? since w includes underscores.
j6A28L6Tmxw,"Been watching your videos ever since becoming passionate about data analytics! You're the best, alex! Thanks so much for the guidance! True inspiration"
j6A28L6Tmxw,"Sir, How companies calculate ytd, l6m sales, ly6m sales, ytg, fiscal year in excel report ?

Can you make a video of mention above metrics in excel ASAP ?"
j6A28L6Tmxw,Can you make more SQL project videos? Your videos are always so amazing!
j6A28L6Tmxw,Love your work alex
j6A28L6Tmxw,"Hi alex, started following your bootcamp after completing advanced excel from somewhere else.

W_s4c1vLGXM,"If we work remotely for a company in the United States and live in Europe, is it common practice to give the same salary, or will they try to adapt to the country you are currently living in?"
W_s4c1vLGXM,And here I’m working at $5K only😢
W_s4c1vLGXM,"I am following your data analyst boot camp
 I HAVE SOME DOUBTS :
1) if we take one data set and working on it, how to know what to do with that data using  sql or PowerBI
2) In PowerBI,  how to know what to do, like  average or sum or anything how to know where to use it particularly, and Dax also, even we know formulaes but How to know where to use what"
W_s4c1vLGXM,Hi
DWte9zjGl0I,I work with health insurance data has billions rows of data and sql is doing the job
DWte9zjGl0I,An update on this topic would be great for 2025
DWte9zjGl0I,Thank you for the clarification!
DWte9zjGl0I,"Agreed. Logically makes sense, practically not so much. Picture yourself at work, struggling with a task to fix a failing SQL query and feeling stumped..."
DWte9zjGl0I,Thanks for the understanding
DWte9zjGl0I,"Hello pls 
I'll like you to talk about Pythonista for iPad... Pls make a full review on how the software can be used fod data analytics"
DWte9zjGl0I,"SQL is really easy to learn if you now how to use python guys,believe you can doing,and you can learn SQL in just 1 or 2 week if you use time on it,after that do you need practice just a little is not to hard"
DWte9zjGl0I,"I am a data scientist who came over from the data engineering side. SQL is my first language. And the reason is that when you get into the corporate environment and out of the small business (start up), the corps data is stored on oracle databases. Oracle is still the top dog. Also, a lot of the ETL is adhoc to serve a very specific customer and analysis. And the majority of you customers are going to use your data with windows apps. Like powerbi and sql server. And now you have TSQL. And because Microsoft knows most data is stored on oracle servers, the quickest way to get data from Oracle to a SQL server is SSIS jobs, using attunity connectors. 😊 

So you really have to know PLSQL. Period. Even if your first language was Python. 

Honestly, I use Python to code in front of  the directors and VP’s. And to build ML pipelines. VP’s get grins from ear to ear when you code in front of them, showing them some quick analytics and graphs. And you can’t built ML without Python. Simple. 

I hope this helps with a bit more understanding. 😊"
DWte9zjGl0I,Down to the point. Thanks!
DWte9zjGl0I,"Love the breakdown for newbies, it's something I've wondered but just assumed the more experienced analysts had a reason."
DWte9zjGl0I,Hi Alex can you demonstrate advanced/specialized analytics with SQL?
DWte9zjGl0I,"Spark for the win! But agree, SQL is a must learn"
DWte9zjGl0I,Wait. I always though it was the other way round. So do you need to learn python if you can do everything in SQL?
DWte9zjGl0I,Thanks for that! I was wondering that for the last few days and finally got a good answer
DWte9zjGl0I,I ❤ your shorts!
DWte9zjGl0I,"I hate python
I adore SQL

Fuck python all my homies ride with SQL"
DWte9zjGl0I,Lol i was starting with sql wondering why python? 😂
DWte9zjGl0I,I use Python to write and execute SQL. Also for local data processing DuckDB is incredible!
DWte9zjGl0I,hello contacts 👌
DWte9zjGl0I,Why do people put dirty data into the database? Why do we clean data after querying it from database? Why not clean it before putting it in the database??
DWte9zjGl0I,thanks man
DWte9zjGl0I,Hi alex. I would love it if you agree to be my mentor in this data analyst journey.
DWte9zjGl0I,Isn't there an all-in-one platform yet where an analyst could perform their work simultaneously?
DWte9zjGl0I,Do you need learn sql if you can do this in power query?🤔
DWte9zjGl0I,"Off the top of my head, *can* you do everything in Python?"
DWte9zjGl0I,"Hi Alex, you are my most brilliant teacher ever, you inspire ever me more
🌼🌼🌼❤❤❤"
DWte9zjGl0I,"How to auto mate with SQL? YouTubers always talk about automating with SQL, I would love to learn how to do thatm"
DWte9zjGl0I,"True, I love both, however if I need to clean a big csv I use pyspark (python library to work with apache spark) it works like pandas but with parallel processing, 3.5 gb of data cleaned in a minute.
However, you would always have to use SQL for something in most data projects"
DWte9zjGl0I,"Hello Alex, please I can't import into SQL from Excel even with 2 method you analysed... Your SQL tutorial Excel.   I am stuck on the first project on your tutorial on SQL  😢😢 I need your help"
DWte9zjGl0I,"Yes but importing data in sql at least MySQL, it takes forever, unless I'm doing it wrong"
DWte9zjGl0I,"Hi Alex, just some constructive criticism regarding your shorts. Please shift the captions a bit higher. Closer to the vertical centre if possible as I couldn't see any wording while watching this short."

## مقدمة
التعابير النمطية (regex) هي سلاسل قوية من الأحرف تستخدم للمطابقة والتعامل مع الأنماط بداخل النصوص. يغطي هذا الدليل أساسيات التعابير النمطية في بايثون، مع التركيز على وحدة `re` ووظائفها الأساسية.

## فهم التعابير النمطية
تخدم التعابير النمطية ثلاثة أغراض رئيسية في معالجة النصوص:
1. التحقق من صحة أنماط النص
2. استخراج أجزاء محددة من النص
3. استبدال النص بناءً على الأنماط

هذه القدرات تجعل التعابير النمطية ضرورية للعديد من التطبيقات، بما في ذلك استخراج بيانات الويب، وتحليل السجلات، والتحقق من صحة البيانات.

## وحدة 're' في بايثون
توفر وحدة `re` المدمجة في بايثون دعماً شاملاً للتعابير النمطية. لاستخدام التعابير النمطية في بايثون، يجب أولاً استيراد الوحدة كالتالي:

```python
import re
```

## الوظائف الأساسية وتطبيقاتها

### 1. re.findall()
تقوم `re.findall()` بإرجاع جميع التطابقات غير المتداخلة لنمط بداخل سلسلة نصية كقائمة من السلاسل. تقوم الوظيفة بمسح النص من اليسار إلى اليمين، وترجع التطابقات بترتيب ظهورها.

#### مثال: البحث عن الكلمات التي تبدأ بحرف 'a'
```python
import re

text = ""Analytics is a science of analysis and analysts are analytical""
pattern = r'\ba\w+'  # \b: حد الكلمة، \w+: حرف واحد أو أكثر
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # يرجع جميع الكلمات التي تبدأ بحرف 'a'
```

### 2. re.search()
تبحث `re.search()` عن أول ظهور لنمط في سلسلة نصية. ترجع كائن تطابق إذا تم العثور عليه، أو None إذا لم يوجد تطابق.

#### مثال: البحث عن كلمة محددة
```python
import re

text = ""Analytics is a science of analysis and analysts are analytical""
pattern = r'analysis'
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print(""تم العثور على الكلمة"")
else:
    print(""لم يتم العثور على الكلمة"")
```

### 3. re.split()
تقوم `re.split()` بتقسيم السلسلة النصية إلى قائمة بناءً على ظهور النمط. عند استخدام الأقواس في النمط، يتم تضمين الأنماط المطابقة في القائمة الناتجة.

#### مثال: التقسيم على المسافات البيضاء
```python
import re

text = ""Analytics is a science of analysis""
pattern = r'\s'  # \s: يطابق المسافات البيضاء
split_text = re.split(pattern, text)
print(split_text)  # يرجع قائمة من الكلمات
```

### 4. re.sub()
تقوم `re.sub()` باستبدال ظهور النمط بسلسلة نصية بديلة. ترجع سلسلة نصية جديدة مع استبدال جميع التطابقات غير المتداخلة من اليسار.

#### مثال: استبدال النص
```python
import re

text = ""Analytics is a science of analysis and analysts are analytical""
pattern = r'analysis'
replacement = 'processing'
new_text = re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)
print(new_text)  # يرجع النص مع استبدال 'analysis' بـ 'processing'
```

## عناصر النمط الشائعة
- `\b`: حد الكلمة
- `\w+`: حرف واحد أو أكثر
- `\s`: المسافات البيضاء
- `r'string'`: تدوين السلسلة الخام (موصى به لأنماط التعابير النمطية)

## أفضل الممارسات
1. استخدم دائماً السلاسل الخام (`r'pattern'`) عند تعريف أنماط التعابير النمطية
2. اختبر الأنماط على عينات من البيانات قبل تطبيقها على مجموعات البيانات الكبيرة
3. فكر في استخدام تجميع النمط للتعابير المستخدمة بشكل متكرر
4. تعامل مع احتمالية إرجاع None من عمليات البحث
5. استخدم عناصر النمط المناسبة بناءً على المتطلبات المحددة

## التطبيقات
التعابير النمطية مفيدة بشكل خاص في:
- استخراج بيانات الويب (استخراج البريد الإلكتروني، أرقام الهواتف)
- التحقق من صحة البيانات (التحقق من مطابقة التنسيق)
- معالجة النصوص (مطابقة الأنماط والتعديل)
- تحليل السجلات (تحديد أنماط معينة في السجلات)

## الخاتمة
توفر التعابير النمطية في بايثون، المنفذة من خلال وحدة `re`، إطار عمل قوي لمطابقة الأنماط ومعالجة النصوص. فهم هذه الوظائف الأساسية وتطبيقها بشكل صحيح يمكّن من معالجة النصوص بكفاءة وقدرات مطابقة الأنماط في تطبيقات بايثون."
EzeeypMKx7o,"using light background while coding is another level of torture. anyway, great video!"
EzeeypMKx7o,"This should be the fisrt video of the playlist :(

Thanks Alex for all your work!"
EzeeypMKx7o,excellent - you teach by showing the commands in action - rather than focusing on the command syntax - one after another - before demonstrating them - which is too late for grasping the concepts
EzeeypMKx7o,"Where I can find complete regex for Python, but nicely ordered? Not like python shitty documentation."
EzeeypMKx7o,"Great video as always, Alex!"
EzeeypMKx7o,"If you don't reply my comment so otherwise i don't want to watch your channel and also recommend to all ,, unsubscribe your channel,,, because your reply need for me and as a YouTube creator your responsibility"
EzeeypMKx7o,"Hii alex sir im from india ,, im B,A english honners student,, but i want job in data analyst,, beacuse its my dream job ,, so plss tell me its is possible me get a job in data analyst and sucssesful data analyst soo plss help me sir ,, beacuse i want to,, im ready to learn."
EzeeypMKx7o,Wating for this. Thanks @Alex
EzeeypMKx7o,1st🎉
OISvlkfbntY,"They want to hire is the people endorsed , peers of there peers ."
OISvlkfbntY,Thanks Alex.
OISvlkfbntY,Bro you should jump straight to the main topic instead of wasting too much time building the case.
OISvlkfbntY,This is a really nice video by being straight to the point. Thanks :D
OISvlkfbntY,"So glad I found this, thank you Alex!"
OISvlkfbntY,Very insightful video. Thank you for the time you put in it. 😊
OISvlkfbntY,"i reached out to 15 different people between 3 different companies, one 1 wrote back and none were willing to help.. lol job market is a joke...12 years experience in my field and cant even get an interview..."
OISvlkfbntY,"Sir I have a good offer If In request to postpone , then will the company give my offer to backup candidate"
OISvlkfbntY,"The video was a bit too vague and beating around the bush, telling us stuff we already knew/ was obvious.
Wish it was more information dense"
OISvlkfbntY,"Hi Alex. This is Harathi from India. I completed My MTech in computer sciences in 2016 . After my education, I have a gap because of my family reasons. Now, I want to restart my career. Is there any possible to get a Data analyst job role? I learnt Mysql. now I am learning Python."
OISvlkfbntY,"Thank you very much Alex, for sharing your thoughts on the hiring manager from this perspective. It is very helpful!!"
OISvlkfbntY,"but what about the degree? If I don't have it, but for example I have in portfolio 3 projects ready to see how I work and how I understand coding without experience ,how is then the situation ? they will gonna skip me ? it's like 99.9% that everybody is looking with minimum Master degree. Thank you for your answer"
OISvlkfbntY,"Whats a working hours data analyst do ? 8h a day, or you can do less?  🙂"
OISvlkfbntY,"Hello Alex. I hope you are doing great. I started self-studying about 10 days ago with you and I'm about to finish the first Udemy course you suggested. I bought the Udemy courses you suggested. It's going reasonably well so far. Although it's not exactly your area, I would like to hear your thoughts about IIBA's Business Analysis certifications such as ECBA which is for entry-level positions. Do you think it might help people who have no background to get some more interviews?"
OISvlkfbntY,"Thank you so much.
This is really informative and helpful."
OISvlkfbntY,🤣 'Promo sm'
OISvlkfbntY,"Just rewatched this video. I have an interview tomorrow morning with a hiring manager at a healthcare company for an entry level analyst position, and this video helped my nerves a bit. The recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn with a couple screening questions after I submitted my application, and then scheduled me for the interview after I responded with my answers. I feel lucky so far as over 500 people have applied. 

Now thanks to this video, I’m more excited than I am anxious for tomorrow!"
OISvlkfbntY,What about doing a video tailored specifically towards the seniority of the position?? Like what are hiring managers looking for an entry level job vs a junior and a senior level role? I would love a more specific breakdown.
OISvlkfbntY,"I have an interview in the coming days, wish me luck guys"
OISvlkfbntY,"Wow! Thank you so much, well said! preparing myself for a job application this time; a career shifter from a housewife : )"
OISvlkfbntY,I juat amde the decision to become a Data Analyst and i feel like a grain of rice losr in the dessert.. hiw do i join yiur biitcamp please
OISvlkfbntY,Hi Alex! I rlly wonder to know ur opinion about the new Comptia Data+ certification as a plus to get a DA job. =)
OISvlkfbntY,"As a petroleum engineering graduate, it's really hard to get a job in this field, It's almost a year that I've been trying to shift into data analytics my only experience with those tools that you've mentioned is based on the projects related to my domain, and still haven't got any response, what can I do to be qualified?"
OISvlkfbntY,"If you are a 'boring' reserved introverted indoor person with a stutter who gets the job done...look elsewhere. Btw, what do you mean by boring? Like boring people are not interested in the work they are supposed to do? Then of course they should not get the job. But if it has to do with other extroverted stuff not related to the job, like going out to drink beer...then that's cruel to reject someone for that."
OISvlkfbntY,"I received a position as a paid intern at AON. If you are entry level and have no experience this is the way to go. I finished the Google Data Analytics certification and applied for the internship. So if you can get in school take a class and go to a career counselor you have a great chance to get a job as a Data Analyst. Also, ask me any questions if you want. 😊"
OISvlkfbntY,I wish this video had come out two weeks ago! I had a referral for a Data Analyst job and the COO was super impressed with my LinkedIn and resume that I ended up skipping the screening and first interview and went to directly to interviewing the analytics team and COO. I got a quick response to my follow-up email and now am waiting for their decision!
OISvlkfbntY,Pleas Mr Alex can you give me online lesson I Am in Iraq and there are no internships here
OISvlkfbntY,"I dont know about some people but being a down person is directly tied to the lack of success unfortunately.

Though as a more shy, introverted person I do a lot better with in-person interview, I am horrible at online interviews."
OISvlkfbntY,"Really love this video!!! So insightful and helpful, thank you so much!"
OISvlkfbntY,I'm Turkish and I live in Turkey. Is it possible to apply for remote jobs in America? Do they accept foreigners?
OISvlkfbntY,"I believe a lot in the last topic, every time I went through an interview I noticed that the final decision was due to my enthusiasm, because I don't even have higher education in the area. I'm a BI analyst."
OISvlkfbntY,"You are the most positive, happy person. When you did those skits with the other influencers, it was kind of scary. It was like ""Dark Alex""...haha"
OISvlkfbntY,Great stuff Alex. In your experience with hiring how important or impactful were references? I agree people usually respond better to other people they connect with but could that change dramatically based on feedback from references?
OISvlkfbntY,"a positive personality with a motivated mindset, good notes to remember on top of all the other technical requirements that come with the position! passion too!"
OISvlkfbntY,"This video was uploaded while I was in the middle of an interview. I think the interview went well nonetheless, but the help would have been nice."
OISvlkfbntY,"For those of us just getting started with little to no college experience, and only courses under our belts. How could we stand out to get into those first interviews? Personally, I feel like I'm cold calling sending in applications and connecting on linked in. Where are the ""hot leads"" for entry level positions? I know a comment section may not be the best place to be asking a question like this but any insight from anyone would be helpful."
OISvlkfbntY,"good stuff being mentioned but totally untrue in reality for me. First of all, probably most of job postings are fake because I have got more than 300 automated emails rejecting me in the past 8 months with the same exact email format. Second, I got quizzes and tests, I got interviews with HR and then proceed to more interviews with senior people. One was for a tableau junior entry. Even though I am not an expert in tableau I would like to work more on that and I also saw the company as an opportunity to open doors for data career as they were also very open about this. I did okish with the tableau technical question  interview, I didn't answer some steps when I was asked to create multiple visualizations on the fly. However, the tableau expert said it was fine and I might need some further training. Then,  they arranged another interview with data scientists. Even though the job was for entry tableau, I got asked about python, ML, NLP and other data science questions. I only didn't answer 1-2 questions, but I was super motivated and asked about what they particularly do and stuff like this. I also asked them if there is flexibility in the company to change positions say to more data engineering (the interview was more focused in this at that time) and I also mentioned that I have taken course in ML and this direction, and they were even not familiar with MLops. 
But I still got rejected. After 3 interviews and tests. And this took more than 2 months. Just a waste of my time and energy.
After all this I have no idea how I can even get an entry role. I can't believe that they always find a better fit than me. Unless they are looking for someone who doesn't know anything and just finished college with no portfolio, because apparently I always see people in companies who take training or don't know any of the basics. How did they even get the job? I have friends who didn't take any data science course or knew anything 1 year ago but got a data science job because they knew someone from the company. In the past month, I have not applied to any job. It is so disappointing. Must be something in my face and voice that they don't like, even though I feel like I am super friendly to them and they also seem friendly to me, but they somehow reject me after the interviews."
OISvlkfbntY,"Thank you Alex! Do you think technical interviews or take home exams are common for data analysts, especially for entry level roles?"
OISvlkfbntY,"Alex, I am a bit introverted, so I take time to get to know people and later I mix up with the team, so is it difficult to get selected in a job interview?"
OISvlkfbntY,Thank you for this vital info...
OISvlkfbntY,"Great share Alex! I love the point about knowing something about the company beyond the surface level. I've found that it's a good move to look up if the company is in the news (hopefully not for anything bad...) but see if they have any new tech innovations to talk about, merger with another company, etc. Then you can carry that forward to the ""Do you have any questions for me?"" and ask about what the company is doing. 

Any other recommendations for the Interviewee Questions phase?"
OISvlkfbntY,I completed your data analyst bootcamp men and I just loved it. Big confidence boost up for me. You are a good Human being along with a good teacher. May God bless you 🙏
OISvlkfbntY,Do every company use a recruiter or typically upper echelon companies? Or is it random?
OISvlkfbntY,"Everyone in comments section competing against one another, may the best prospect succeed as a result of the work done."
OISvlkfbntY,"This was an incredibly helpful video that came out at the perfect time. I did a prescreen last week and this afternoon I have an interview with the data team lead and the CTO and to tell you I am nervous would be a massive understatement. Thank you, Alex!"
OISvlkfbntY,omg this will help me a lot as i have interview scheduled....❤❤❤
OISvlkfbntY,"That is exactly what hiring managers do (caveat: n=1!). At my last company, I'd moved to another team but still kept in touch with the original team I started with because I liked them. You could always be pretty confident that anybody they hired would be just like the supervisor who did the interviewing (there were multiple teams on the larger team and the different supervisors had very different personalities 😂). I understand the psychology at play; however, frankly I'm more put off by that kind of thing than people wanting to hire people that want to do the job. To be clear, I'm not particularly put off by either, but if I had to pick one practice I liked less, it would be the former. Mostly mentioning this because I got the impression that you were more ""apologetic"" (for lack of a better word) for the latter. I could be mistaken though!

Anyway, that's a good point about the recruiter screening being a good indicator of what the hiring manager interview might be like. I hadn't quite conceptualized it like that before but it makes sense. :D"
OISvlkfbntY,Educative🙌🙌 this is why you are my favorite. Thank you
OISvlkfbntY,I appreciate all the help you give us.
OISvlkfbntY,"Hiring managers are looking for AI for now on! All those complicated procedures to hire people will disappear, as humans commit mistakes and we aren't perfect enough to fill all the requirements for a job position. Previous experiences are mandatory and all of them created by humanity could be delivered by AI in a few seconds. It is only the reality!"
OISvlkfbntY,Alex The Great
OISvlkfbntY,"This is just so awesome, thank you so much for everything you do Alex! You’re the 💣"
OISvlkfbntY,Thank you for all you do Alex.❤
OISvlkfbntY,Thats beneficial thank you!❤️
8dTpNajxaH0,I  followed all your steps but with a different web site and I am getting an error message. Not sure what to do.  I got the titles but no the info to go into it
8dTpNajxaH0,Just select the table and paste it to Excel. İt is that easy. Maybe this is all you can able to do about scraping. So you don't show something more.
8dTpNajxaH0,thankyou for your help sir
8dTpNajxaH0,"Thank you for the video, Alex!  I was able to troubleshoot some of my own issues doing this in 2025 w/a slightly different table layout in Wiki thanks to your tutorial.  I really appreciate you taking the time to do all this and show the process."
8dTpNajxaH0,"Amaizng content still going with your bootcamp before my actual bootcamp starts, in 2025 class has been updated to “wiki sortable plainrowheaders” 🤣"
8dTpNajxaH0,Thanks a lot for sharing!!!
8dTpNajxaH0,What if there is a captcha in any website?  What can we so with them??
8dTpNajxaH0,"Guys can anyone help please...
In minute 18:00 only 10 rows are showing to me each time I run it, even tho I'm doing exactly the same steps as Alex.
so if anyone may know how to solve this problem please comment on this, for now I'm going to skip this project."
8dTpNajxaH0,what should i do if i had a same class name in the html table??
8dTpNajxaH0,Very detailed explanation. I am new to python and learned a lot from your videos. I also do scraping but i build my own google chrome extension using Javascript as well. Your videos have a lot of things that mostly not mentioned in other traditional tutorials.
8dTpNajxaH0,This tutorial is super helpful! Can HasData handle multiple requests for scraping data from different websites at once?
8dTpNajxaH0,"Hi Alex love listening to your videos, I am learning a lot. Quick question I am trying to scrape a list from a website with text only and do comparisons is it possible?"
8dTpNajxaH0,Is this still the way webscraping works in 2025?
8dTpNajxaH0,can you teach us how to slower a website
8dTpNajxaH0,one of the best explainations i have seen
8dTpNajxaH0,"21:37
If you are having issues here, try this

td_tag = table.find_all('td')
table_list = [clean.text.strip() for clean in td_tag]
num_columns = len(df.columns)
rows = [table_list[i:i+num_columns] for i in range(0, len(table_list), num_columns)]
new_df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=df.columns)

The issue is that when Alex did the tutorial, each row was in a list, but now all the data is in a single list. That is the reason for the errors.

Many thanks to Alex for the detailed tutorials."
8dTpNajxaH0,Hey Alex! The second row of code no longer works... probably because of wikipedia or python changing things up. Just wanted to let you know
8dTpNajxaH0,"Thank you so much Alex 🙏🏾🙏🏾

So you do you:
Soup = find_all('table')[0]"
8dTpNajxaH0,Highly informative video. Thanks
8dTpNajxaH0,Really clear breakdown! Do you think using HasData would simplify the process of scraping for beginners?

thank  you as always, sir♥♥"
8dTpNajxaH0,"Really great breakdown of web scraping, clear and insightful! 
Around 19:00, you append rows directly to a DataFrame inside the loop. Just a friendly note: this method can be inefficient because it creates a new object each time. A more efficient approach is to collect data in a list and build the DataFrame once at the end. Appreciate your content - very well done!"
8dTpNajxaH0,"Hi thank you for great content, can i also scrap multi pages websites. won't it be too lengthy?"
8dTpNajxaH0,Just beginner question what type of IDE is it?

8dTpNajxaH0,since technically the website I am scraping violates the terms of service for the website but it is technically still legal
8dTpNajxaH0,Do you think it would be a bad idea to publish a webscraping program that someone like me hypothetically created to grab product information from a website to my data portfolio that job hiring managers would look at? or would that probably be ok?

8dTpNajxaH0,Thanks to you. I used csv module to scrape and capture the table data in csv file.
8dTpNajxaH0,"Very useful, especially the summary at the last part of the video. Great job and thanks a lot!"
8dTpNajxaH0,No need to apologize for running into issues. That is what helps newbies learn.  Thank you for not editing that out.
8dTpNajxaH0,"Excellent video  easy to understand step by step clear explanation wow super. if everyone explain like this, I'm sure everyone going to be coding side. make another  video on dynamic HTML.."
8dTpNajxaH0,"In the table i used the rank_row_data  (1,2,3,4,..) came under ""th"""
8dTpNajxaH0,"Hey if you are doing this tutorial in December 2024 your table setup from the website will be different of his, like me when I pulled the table headers before trying to put them into panda, I had all the table headers he had in the tutorial plus number 1-50 table headers. So, what I did to get the same output is that I used a different code to retrieve the table headers he had,    table = soup.find_all('tr')[0]    this gave me the exact headers from Rank to Ref. and didn't give me the 1-50 table headers as before because that would be at index ('tr)[1]. Then I performed the loop as he did and continued from there.
Or if you don't want to go through all that, since it is a list then you can remove all the extra things it gives you manually and use only what you need. There are a lot of ways to get to the same solution it does not have to be only one way."
8dTpNajxaH0,mia padre letteralmente
8dTpNajxaH0,"Hey It's very intuitive Alex, your way of explaining makes me more interest into this topic."
8dTpNajxaH0,S ir pls your camera is burr
8dTpNajxaH0,"I did it doing just this:
import pandas as pd
URL=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue""
df=pd.read_html(URL)[0]
print(df)
Its easier, isnt it?"
8dTpNajxaH0,"How to scrape a table when the table has  split column ?
I used this website, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue .
Also when I used final_all('td"") could not get all the data for each row."
8dTpNajxaH0,Thank you so much for sharing your valuable lesson free. Wishing you continued success and growth in your career!
8dTpNajxaH0,"Alex, for those folks that are running this example currently, it appears that they removed the first table so the index has moved from [1] to [0]. (@ 8:42)  Great job on this class. Love it!!!"
8dTpNajxaH0,"when people say, ""BeautifulSoup is a library,"" they’re speaking colloquially. Technically, BeautifulSoup is a class, and bs4 is the actual library (package)."
8dTpNajxaH0,"Honestly, I love to create the project and learnings, thank u so much"
8dTpNajxaH0,can you also export this database as json?
8dTpNajxaH0,This got very enjoyable at the end when I exported it as csv😁Thanks for this man
8dTpNajxaH0,Why do I need Eql bro?😮
8dTpNajxaH0,"Hi Alex,

What is your approach to dealing with Offset=? for web scraping? Sometimes a webpage that would have a div that has numerous pages so to say.

Thanks."
8dTpNajxaH0,"hey alex, i had a problem in the very end, idk why excel saw the numbers as decimal numbers, so Instead of 161000 it appeared 161, the only solution I found was to put a cell above and write this:

df[""Employees""] = df[""Employees""].astype(str).str.replace("","", ""."")
df[""Revenue (USD millions)""] = df[""Revenue (USD millions)""].astype(str).str.replace("","", ""."")

I hope it helps someone, thanks you very much for this bootcamp. i sent you a hug from argentina"
8dTpNajxaH0,"Hello Alex Sir, 
1. First of all, your work and teaching skills are quite remarkable. You make the learning process easy and smooth, which is also helping numerous learners.
2. I am following through the whole process side by side but at the end, the number of rows and columns becomes (400,7) when I apply a df.shape function. On the other hand , when I look closely you have only (100,7). I need some guidance on that. Please resolve my issue.
3. Eagerly waiting for your reply. 
Thank You."
8dTpNajxaH0,"wonderfull video 🤗.what is the crazy part is that, this one line code done the same (need to download the lxml libary)
df_1 = po.read_html('https://ene.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_India')[0] ☺."
8dTpNajxaH0,"instead of doing US companies i try to make it a little challenging for me and do it hare :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Swedish_companies
before you solve the rookie issue i handled it like this
world_titles = soup.find_all('th')[8:17]
and shabbash to my self that worked. thank you Alex. you are grate and doing the grate. God speed.😇"
8dTpNajxaH0,"in my case , i need to use table = soup.find_all('table')[0] (0 here is position 1). why different?"
8dTpNajxaH0,good job.
8dTpNajxaH0,Thank you Alex!! The playlist was very helpful.
8dTpNajxaH0,"hi everybody, i ran into a problem at 18:46. When i ran it, the results is the second table not the first table, can anybody help me out? i don't know what i  did were wrong, i even copy Alex code to the jupyter but it still give me the second table result. Thank you in advance."
8dTpNajxaH0,"September 27, 2024
video @ 12:35

If you still can't get the correct column names then please use 0th index instead of 1.

Just replace 

table = soup.find_all('table')[1]

with 

table = soup.find_all('table')[0]


and then run this cell and the following ones
thank you"

oreAsJTNcsA,Great presentation! Is there a link to the slides?
oreAsJTNcsA,Learning in South Sudan 🇸🇸
oreAsJTNcsA,I really I am Alex videos fun.
oreAsJTNcsA,This SQL video is a waste of time. If any beginner like me in sql has came here to learn sql then please find something else.
oreAsJTNcsA,I started programming around 12 years old.  I've been a software engineer for 20 years (C# and SQL mainly).  In college I had to take Calculus and Statistics to get my CS degree. Waste of time!   I've worked and major Banks and  Insurance companies.  I don't think I've did much above basic algebra.  As long as you know the logic the computer will do it for you.
oreAsJTNcsA,Thank you Alex!
oreAsJTNcsA,Looking forward to learn SQL
oreAsJTNcsA,Amazing. Thank you
oreAsJTNcsA,"This is, by far, the greatest Content Creator I've ever found. I'm not exactly a techie, but to avoid ending up on a soup line, I've been learning marketable skills. It's not so common for an individual to be both well-versed in dense techie topics & able to explain it in a brief, understandable, and practical way, but damn, Alex the Analyst... *Thank you*. (No, I wasn't given anything to write this, but am compelled to do so after viewing ATA's content versus those of others, which can be laughably unclear)."
oreAsJTNcsA,Thanks for the content its a good starter for beginners
oreAsJTNcsA,I really wanted to complete the course. But I use Mac M2. I think I am not having proper guideline about how to setup. I tried through docker and terminal command. It was going okay until my azure studio is not able to find my localhost and could not get connected. I wish I could get a solution of the pretty unknown problem.. :(
oreAsJTNcsA,I am from Louisville Kentucky and I am taking SQL as part of my computer engineering degree
oreAsJTNcsA,I really appreciate this video but it has a title that’s not quite right. The only thing that is advanced is window function and there is a very short mention about it.

oreAsJTNcsA,"Alex, you are doing a great work. For me, I am kind refresh what I learnt from ATLytiCS boot camp ."

oreAsJTNcsA,Super awesome. Thank you.
oreAsJTNcsA,Love from Pakistan 🙂🙂
oreAsJTNcsA,Is this video enough for data analyst ???!

oreAsJTNcsA,thanks
oreAsJTNcsA,"13:23 What was the purpose of the 'AS salary' statement here? I don't quite understand the meaning of 'naming' an output as it is being used here, since 'AVG(salary)' could do the job, maybe?

oreAsJTNcsA,from where can i get this data set
oreAsJTNcsA,"Terrible examples, never ever ever ever use subqueries in WHERE clause"

oreAsJTNcsA,"thank you, Alex , for clearing most of my questions before jumping into the job market. Really enjoyed the whole video. 

Keep it Up."
oreAsJTNcsA,"Dear Alex,
thanks for the insight"
oreAsJTNcsA,New subscriber and this is my first video.  Great content.
oreAsJTNcsA,"Hello Alex, the content is amazing. Congratulations!

31:13 Could you please recommend some tools to help me to identify the bottlenecks to optimize my queries?

Thank you so much"
oreAsJTNcsA,"An easier way to explain indexing is to compare it to a book. A book has an index page that shows where to find the topics in a book. So, instead of you going through the entire book to find the topic you're looking for; the index page helps you know where exactly that topic is. Saving you time. Therefore, same thing with SQL queries."
oreAsJTNcsA,could you do something like this for python too? I'm struggling so much with python...

xjA1HjvmoMY,awesome content
xjA1HjvmoMY,"3:33 class: container and col are bootstrap , a css framework :)"
xjA1HjvmoMY,"Bro talks way too much. just get on with it and show a working example of the code. Hint if someone is performing webscraping in python more than very likely they already know html and dont want to spend 20 minutes of listening to you waffling on about html tags. you could've made these videos a lot shorter, we dont need a hundred running examples. we just need a single example and we dont want to waste time listening to you gabber on about table data tags."

xjA1HjvmoMY,Thank you for this! Awesome starting point for my nlp project!
xjA1HjvmoMY,"you don't need to use find function to get text, just try soup.find_all(arguments...)[x].text.strip()  .        You can write 0,1,2,3.... for x  depending on which data you want. for example in 10:15 for x=1 the data text must be ""Year"". because 1 is  the second index in python after first index 0"
xjA1HjvmoMY,"Hello, thank you so much for this wonderful tutorial. However, I have one doubt that needs clarifying. So I tried this code out with the same set of codes and Url you have used but there seems to be a problem in this line -> print(Soup.find_all('p',class_=""lead"")). the output for this line shows [ ] .. which isn't the paragraph from the website. How do I rectify this problem? also, I use IDLE for Python. Once again your videos are awesome and I hope you continue making more great coding content."

This should be the 3rd video of the playlist ^^"

xjA1HjvmoMY,"I am pretty new to data analysis and I was working on a project where I would need to scrape data from a website and this tutorial has been so helpful! I spent hours trying to figure it out and the other tutorials on Youtube don't explain anything or skip steps and so it's hard to learn and personalize it for your own project.
This however was detailed and straight to the point! Thank you so much. You're a lifesaver!"
xjA1HjvmoMY,Where we can find the same notebooks page you use during all the video ? :)
xjA1HjvmoMY,"Thanks for all you do Alex. Can you be so kind to continue this series, especially for advanced scrapping, like scrapping from unstructured data etc"
xjA1HjvmoMY,"Thank you ,I also finished this playlist"
xjA1HjvmoMY,"I tried learning web scrapping atleast 5 time and failed everytime.

bargNl2WeN4,"Very important, DO NOT forget to use a timer otherwise you will find yourself causing DOS on the website you're scraping from or your IP being blocked by the site. 

Load the page in a browser and copy the page source when building your scraper."
bargNl2WeN4,"I went over the documentation for BeautifulSoup but watching your video is reinforcing everything I read. I will be watching the rest of your videos on this, thanks!"
bargNl2WeN4,So easy to understand. Thank you teacher
bargNl2WeN4,I have an issue I get an error at 4:13
bargNl2WeN4,can you interact using beautiful soup like clicking or entering data in an input tab
bargNl2WeN4,This is simply amazing!  I have spent hours trying to figure out how to do a basic scrape and finally this video did it.  I truly appreciate you sir!
bargNl2WeN4,"can someone hire me?! I know sql, tableau and excel"
bargNl2WeN4,"Hello I am an aspiring data analyst I have been watching your ""how to build a resume videos""; in one of them, about three years ago, your were reviewing resumes and I wanted to know if you would be willing to review mine (not video or anything), thank you for your hard work ^_^"
bargNl2WeN4,"i am getting this error 
ImportError: cannot import name 'beautifulSoup' from 'bs4' (C:\Users\ASUS\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\bs4\__init__.py)
can you tell how to measure it."
bargNl2WeN4,A caveat worth mentioning is to read the terms of use for any website or data source to ensure web scraping or other automated non-API retrieval method is allowed.
bargNl2WeN4,Thanks Alex for this second video on the web scrapping series!
bargNl2WeN4,Alex thanks for making beautifulsoup as simple as possible
bargNl2WeN4,I have been waiting for the next video since you started the Web scraping series. Thank you Alex 😊
bargNl2WeN4,What series is this video part of?
bargNl2WeN4,I just remebered my first data scrapping project using BeautifulSoup looking at this video. Thank you very much Alex for sharing this video. It's a great start for anybody looking to scrape data from various sources and easy to grasp when compared to tools like Selenium.
q-kbzWjyPak,Awesome content! I'm curious if HasData could help with scraping different websites more efficiently?
q-kbzWjyPak,"ok ,thanks alot ,this is such an amazing video ,i was manually trying to find the title which took me good 2 to 3 minutes but this is amazing ,once again thanks alot"
q-kbzWjyPak,"Hello everyone, 
I am learning python and I am on web scraping topic but I have zero knowledge of html.. So, is it necessary to learn html before I learn web scraping or ale's web scraping video includes all the information related to it... 
For all who would reply.. Thanks in advance for your time and help!!"
q-kbzWjyPak,❤❤❤
q-kbzWjyPak,This is so good. ❤
q-kbzWjyPak,This is so good. ❤
q-kbzWjyPak,"That's really a great video, especially that arrow part its literally a game changer"
q-kbzWjyPak,amazing content. Was actually looking for a video which could scrape an actual website than a static local html page. Thank you very much.
q-kbzWjyPak,Can you create a playlist for web scraping so we could know which videos to watch first thank you
q-kbzWjyPak,Amazing how in a couple of short videos this man can teach me more than a coursera course
q-kbzWjyPak,Can you make a video on how to convert outlook emails in to HTML file using python
q-kbzWjyPak,very helpful!!!
q-kbzWjyPak,Please continue the series. its more helpful.
q-kbzWjyPak,"Very easy to digest, thank you Alex!"
q-kbzWjyPak,love your tutorials! In my view better than Coursara's videos. I had to always watch yours too to actually understand things. Thanks! Also you have the best smile!
q-kbzWjyPak,"Hi alex, thx fhaor this cool tutorial.  what tool are u hosting to have such a page for data entry? Thank you"
q-kbzWjyPak,"Cool info! Super excited about this mini-series within your Python series of your bootcamp. Seems like a VERY important and useful skillset to know. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!"
q-kbzWjyPak,Thanks for the time you've taken to create this.
q-kbzWjyPak,Most excellent!
q-kbzWjyPak,"I was at the end of the bootcamp and I just see that there is 4 videos that I didn´t see...And I just realize that are new videos, thanks ALEX XD"
q-kbzWjyPak,I liked this video! You explained pretty good. I'm starting a new personal project using web scrapping with Python and I'm following your videos about this topic! Keep going
q-kbzWjyPak,Thank you for sharing Alex.
q-kbzWjyPak,"Alex, I'm sure you get this a lot, but you are the man! You content is gold, as always!"
q-kbzWjyPak,"Promoting this video massively, thank you Alex for always keeping it simple."
q-kbzWjyPak,"Respected Alex, how we can make money as a data analyst from freelancing?"
q-kbzWjyPak,"Hi Alex, thanks for starting a series on webscraping. I am already webscraping for a few months and I think it is a very valuable skill for any Data Analyst. 

Creating your own data sets really gave me more appreciation for all the open data sets out there (especially because you start to realise all the hard work that goes into it).  Furthermore you learn more about programming and data structures, which is great!

Just wondering: when talking about covering advanced webscraping in the future do you mean scraping with  Scrapy? I would love to learn more about that, but unfortunately there are not many people that talk about this."
q-kbzWjyPak,Thanks for sharing this information Alex!👋
q-kbzWjyPak,"Many in the data analytics world including myself came from the currently over-saturated web development market, and this was indeed a good knowledge refreshment! Thank you Alex!"
q-kbzWjyPak,To the moon with PapayaHub!
q-kbzWjyPak,Thank you for sharing
q-kbzWjyPak,Thanks so much Alex for taking out from your precious time to give such a valuable and crystal clear explanations on the above.

PExdWWcxmro,"Hey Alex, I started working on my 4th portfolio project. The dataset i chose to use is Stack Overflow annual developer survey for 2022. Initially i was going to analyze developer stats for all countries but after some thought i decided to focus only on developers from my country. 

The issue i realized is that there are only 191 entries that i can then use. Is this too few? Would you recommend doing all countries? 

Also, if you're familiar with the dataset, could you suggest any questions that i should aim to answer and later visualize?"
PExdWWcxmro,Thank you Alex
PExdWWcxmro,"Hey Alex! How are you? Just wanna express my greatest gratitude to you! I've been in a job that I hate and looking for ways to get out of that. By then, I came to know your videos talking about data analyst, and it was 2 years ago. Deep down, I know data analyst is something for me, but I didn't take the step at the time. I kept switching jobs that I think would help me get better, but none of them seemed to work for me. One day, your vid popped out again, and I guess it was the so-called God sign...haha. I started to follow your vid for tutorials and take the courses you recommended!! After 9 months!!! I'm officially hired as a business analyst! I'm much more happier right now! So everyone who is watching Alex's vid for career transition, believe in him AND yourself! God makes way for you!"

Liv6eeb1VfE,"In my case Mean and mode only work when i

Liv6eeb1VfE,"Bro....this was a cool video, thank you"
Liv6eeb1VfE,Noooo Alex your proving that americans are bad at geography lmao
Liv6eeb1VfE,"You can easily sort the columns of a Pandas DataFrame alphabetically using the sort_index() method and specifying axis=1.

Here's how to do it with examples:

Python

import pandas as pd

# 1. Create a sample DataFrame with unsorted columns
data = {'zebra': [1, 5, 9],
        'apple': [2, 6, 10],
        'grape': [3, 7, 11],
        'banana': [4, 8, 12]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(""Original DataFrame (columns unsorted):"")
print(df)
print(""\n"" + ""=""*40 + ""\n"")

# 2. Sort columns alphabetically
# axis=1 specifies that we want to sort along the columns (axis 0 is rows)
df_sorted_columns = df.sort_index(axis=1)

print(""DataFrame with columns sorted alphabetically:"")
print(df_sorted_columns)
print(""\n"" + ""=""*40 + ""\n"")"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"At 25:15, use df2 = df.groupby('Continent')[df.columns[-5:-13:-1]].mean(numeric_only=True).sort_values(by=""2022 Population"", ascending=False)"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Error at 11:12 can be debugged with df1 = df.select_dtypes(include=np.number)
df1.corr()"
Liv6eeb1VfE,svp la command df.corr() ne marche pas chez moi pouvez m'aider
Liv6eeb1VfE,Did anyone else realize that sorting by population and world population percentage didn't change anything. Believe the calculated formula is based off the 2022 population if it doesn't specifically tell you otherwise. But additionally I began to explore the calculation and found the percentages not to be based off that. But I guess this is why it is exploratory. Also @ 25:00 I instead did a my slicing by [12:4:-1] as i knew there was a way to reverse the output instead of manually doing.
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Just in you are running into an error at minute @11:12, add numeric_only = True to the corr. i.e df.corr(numeric_only = True)."
Liv6eeb1VfE,"If you want to flip the dataframe columns after you've already done df2 = df.groupby('Continent')[df.columns[5:13]].mean(numeric_only = True).sort_values(by = ""2022 Population"", ascending = False), you can put df2 = df2[df2.columns[::-1]] in the next cell/line to remedy the ordering."
Liv6eeb1VfE,❤❤❤
Liv6eeb1VfE,"@AlexTheAnalyst, isn't your data multicollinear? 13.25"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hey Alex, this is actually the first comment I’ve ever written, but I just had to say—your ""Pandas for Beginners"" playlist has been incredibly helpful in my education journey. I’m really grateful for your content. Keep up the awesome work!"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hi Alex, i was wondering do we have to remember all these commands or somthing?"
Liv6eeb1VfE,hey! one of the best videos ive ever seen. regards from chile
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hello Alex,
I learn a lot technically from your video. But your comment about the Asian population increasing so sharply from 1990 to 2000 should have ring an alarm bell in your head as well as the fact that your graph shows a decrease of the Asian population from 1970 to 1980. If you had gone through the ""data cleaning"" step before the EDA, you would have noticed that India's data - the second most populated country of the Asian continent behind China up to 2022 since it overtook China lately - are missing for years 1980 and 1990. It explains this lack of growth for the Asian continent on your graph during this period. Garbage in, garbage out. Each time you see something ""incredible"", ask yourself if you have arguments to support it."
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hi, I'm struggeling again at [27] (~16:44):  finally I found that there are some pandas issues: f.e. in this video it's used: df.groupby('Continent').mean()  which leads to an error. ==>
current pandas needs:  df.groupby('Continent').mean(numeric_only=True)  !!
==> Type Error:  agg function failed [how->mean,dtype->object]
I hope this will help."
Liv6eeb1VfE,Having a value error pop up when I try df.corr() (at 10:57).  I googled and tried method='pearson' as it suggested on several forums but it isn't working either.  Any ideas that I can use to have it show the rank correlations like in the video?
Liv6eeb1VfE,25:13 you can apply negative slicing for reversing the plot
Liv6eeb1VfE,"If you are having any at 16:59, that's because you are looking for the mean of other datatypes apart from numbers. To resolve this, include numeric_only=True in your mean function, as in ""df.groupby('Continent').mean(numeric_only=True)"""
Liv6eeb1VfE,So there's another EDA acronym in tech other than Event Driven Architecture.
Liv6eeb1VfE,"If you want research a trend you need equal range ex. every 10 years on x axis. In your case there is 10 years and then 5 years and 2 years. In my opinion this is wrong approach. Am I right?

Btw. Nice content :)"

Liv6eeb1VfE,"In case you are only getting the first row of annotations on heatmap: !pip install --upgrade seaborn

Liv6eeb1VfE,Thank you so much for this. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot of what I had forgotten a few years ago.

Liv6eeb1VfE,thank you
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hello,
100000000 thanks for sharing 
For the Corealtion part at 11mn
df.corr(numeric_only=True) # pass numeric only param to not having error"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"I really appreciate your effort to teach us, Alex! Thank you so much! 
I have been using CoPilot (from MS) and it has helping me very much to understand and solve some errors I encouter"
Liv6eeb1VfE,OOPs 
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hello, Alex! 
Once again, thanks a lot for all your hard work!
At 13:10 I got an error ValueError: 'box_aspect' and 'fig_aspect' must be positive""
Solved it by putting the plt.rcParams BEFORE the sns.heatmap
The other problem was that some functions didn't work until I added the parameter numeric_only = True, e.g., df.corr (numeric_only=True) or .mean(numeric_only = True)
Hope, it can help someone!"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"I think some of you would be met with an error when typing this line of code as mentioned at  11:11: df.corr() this is because it takes all types (data types) of values in consideration and to alleviate this: 
1) You can either use google colab which will automatically handle this error
2) Just code like this: df.corr(numeric_only = True)

Hope this is helpful..🤍"
Liv6eeb1VfE,Thank you for the Pandas class!
Liv6eeb1VfE,"df4=df3.sort_index(ascending=True)
df4                   at 26:11  as alex is sorting manually you sort the year directly by this command"

# Select numeric columns (excluding any non-numeric columns)
numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64'])

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = numeric_columns.corr()

Liv6eeb1VfE,great
Liv6eeb1VfE,"at minute 10:56 if you get this error ""ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'AFG'"" do this df.corr(numeric_only=True)"

I'm getting a value error in this part.
please share the solution if you have one 
thanks :)"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Thank you so much Alex, truly great content you put out there. I have a question please; when I run df.groupby('Continent').mean() and df.corr() I get errors, please what could be the cause and what can I do to remedy it."
Liv6eeb1VfE,"16:58 Try with This Code

df.groupby('Continent').mean(numeric_only = True)"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Oceania is one of the 7 Continents (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, Antartica). It's basically Australia and the countries (islands) around it. 
Hope that helps!"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"Hey, just a quick note here, when we're plotting the populations, it's only related to the numeric values compared to the highest populations, in fact (for example) Oceania's population increased in around 2.5 times

Anyway, thanks for the content, it's amazing"
Liv6eeb1VfE,"We can also write this to save time writing all the column names in the list ""df2 = df.groupby('Continent')[df.columns[12:4:-1]].mean(numeric_only=True).sort_values(by='2022 Population', ascending=False)

fHK4nHbUtj0,"Hi, i went through your SQL videos. In the first video, when you were creating the table you mentioned that you will explain about data types(int, varchar, etc) in some other video but i couldn't find any.. 
Why do you use varchar and not char? Then in later videos you used nvarchar.. what's the difference? And how to choose the right data type?"
fHK4nHbUtj0,When do you have to download
fHK4nHbUtj0,I have a linguistics degree and I HOPE employers recognize that as as an analytical degree. But most people don’t understand what the degree is. Most who graduated with it when I was in school became translators of new languages for which a grammar had never been constructed. Do you think employers are aware of the value of that degree?
fHK4nHbUtj0,I agree

Also, the name on my old certificates it my proper name have been changed in to ABDIRAHMAN SAID . I am not satisfied with this, because I can't use this certificates if they are not by my real name.

5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hey thanks for doing this but I still have no idea 'What is Microsoft Fabric'.  Seriously, what is? What does it do? Why is it better than the thing before it? Will it program my connectors in exchange? I really want to know."
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wish you'd slow down a bit........
5l2d_Rv0odE,"If we already have databricks, do we really need fabric? The data is stored as per medallion architecture and governed via unity catalog within databricks catalogs, why do we need fabric then?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Can it be used without azure cloud subscription?
5l2d_Rv0odE,"I am new user 
Fabric is free to use like powerbi only to publish you need license?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,seems to be a hackers wet dream
5l2d_Rv0odE,next time please keep the video bg music in slow phase because some people like me watch at 1.5x speed. The bg music is so fast btw. thanks!!
5l2d_Rv0odE,Not exactly revolution.
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Thanks, Alex, for this video. 

I am new to Auze Cloud Data engineering. Do u recommend starting with fabric or need to study for something else?

Note that the time is very important for me I have a project to finish its MVP within just 20 days only.

will appreciate if u recommend a free course in what u will guide ."
5l2d_Rv0odE,"As usual, MS figures out that open source has figured out how to do good things and MS copies it and tells MS zealots that they need to do it the MS way."
5l2d_Rv0odE,Thanks Alex
5l2d_Rv0odE,shill
5l2d_Rv0odE,is there a certificate and course i can do based on this technology in 2025
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hey guys, does onelake support SAP BW and S4 Hana tables?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,I wonder if MS use the data for themselves... who cares right? lol
5l2d_Rv0odE,"To learn it, do we need to know any programming language? Does it require coding?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"I kind of dont get it.
Power BI does exacly the same.
so i dont get why microsoft created kind of a copy of power bi?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Anyone else doing the Microsoft fabric hackathon?
5l2d_Rv0odE,"How does this work with real time production data are data lakes in Azure just powerful enough to handle everything hitting it at once, or would you still have some sort of shadow copy of the prod data for things like analytics tools and reporting as to free up resources and performance on prod?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Yes, mind blowing is to access a bucket of Amazon through a client that connects to Azure, so data first goes from amazon to azure and than from the last to your laptop:facepalm; What an innovation! lol"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow Microsoft is amazing and innovative
5l2d_Rv0odE,*Synapse Analytics 2.0
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Great overview, thx"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, do you have any plans to release some Fabric Tutorials? I'm loving your videos and now I'm trying to get into Fabric and it's Toolkit. Greetings from Germany"
5l2d_Rv0odE,I guess ill add it to list of things to learn ...
5l2d_Rv0odE,In a week there will be another bunch of names
5l2d_Rv0odE,Why dont they just call it Microsoft Porridge. Just another bunch of disconnected Microsoft names from the the Msoft name factory.
5l2d_Rv0odE,"so we don't need to migrate data to Onelake but we need to have a copy in onelake. if we try to access the data from a PC on premise, will MS charge for egress traffic?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Seems a lot like SnowFlake and Databricks, is this Microsoft's attempt to compete gainst Snowflake?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow.. Awesome is this MS Fabric
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Never got the big deal with Fabric besides it being a new licence model. Synapse and Data Factory existed before.. Basically the news is parquet format and data lake made to work with Apache Spark, i mean Databricks 😅"
5l2d_Rv0odE,interested to know difference between snowflake vs fabric
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Well, first time seeing your channel @Alex, but I just simply subscribed! !"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"I'm a big fan of Palantir Foundry at work. Fabric seems to capture many of its best features. Though, idk if Fabric has a comparable MLOPs capability."
5l2d_Rv0odE,Great tool but such a bad name! I wonder why they named it Fabric...
5l2d_Rv0odE,How is it different from synapse analytics? Is not it kind a same?
5l2d_Rv0odE,Hey Alex thanks for the great tutorial. Short simple and straight to the point.
5l2d_Rv0odE,What is the difference between Azure Synapse and Azure Fabric?
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Love your videos Alex! so informative as always. Though I have to say for this one that the constant visual effect of the slide/ changing between the screen and your lovely face, with the 'vfump' sound effect across the video is so distracting for me xD"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Can I disengage Fabric while testing my app?  Waiting for Node link to appear when executing Core C# is slowing me down?
5l2d_Rv0odE,"The biggest concept aside from accessing data anywhere , its just the use of AI to basically do everything you need , Copilots will help users do everything. Is like having a ""jarvis"" guiding you through any concept as related to data ....end to end .... the era of AI is just amazing"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Microsoft are bringing their end user data tools to a whole new level. If the execution matches the demos it will be game changing, really interested in the security and privacy segmentation."
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Fabric offers a huge box of opportunities, it's amazing how much you crammed into this 7 minute video Alex - great work 💪"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hello Alex! Can I use a visualization tool to create charts and analysis, or do I have to stick with what comes out of the box in Microsoft Fabric?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hey Alex Please let me know, ETL dev Vs BI dev Vs Data analyst which will having great opportunity when it comes to hikes, demand, onsite opportunity"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"""Because it's all standardized in Delta Kale""

How is this revolutionary or this news worthy when  this is just the creation of  singular standardized format that can then be used by other systems/platforms using Microsoft Tools. How would this be different from any other competitor coming up with a format that all your users agree to work with?  How is is different from any other data conversion tool/application/system?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Wow, this is game changer."
5l2d_Rv0odE,Thanks
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hello Alex, I am watching your channel!"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, just a quick question. I am using Azure Virtual Machine and Azure SQL DB for hosting my website and mobile application. Is Microsoft fabric also providing hosting service?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, I'm seeking some suggestions. I tend to get demotivated whenever I struggle to comprehend certain concepts or fail to solve tasks while taking a course. Could you please provide me with some tips on how to stay committed to a course and see it through to the end?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, I would like to ask for suggestions on how to secure data analyst interviews specifically for individuals with expertise in SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. Is it possible to land an interview if I only have knowledge of SQL?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"oh cool, this reminds me of the Databricks approach"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Now it's time to make a tutorial!!!!! Let's grow
5l2d_Rv0odE,"As an aspiring Data Analyst, should I still learn how to use Azure or should I focus on Fabric?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,How is it different from Microsoft graph?
5l2d_Rv0odE,"It's all good and well to say you can grab your data from anywhere but often the biggest headache is with connectivity with external platforms/systems on the infra side with firewalls, whitelisting, vnets blah blah blah. Concept is good but I'm far from sold"
5l2d_Rv0odE,WTF with a face like that?!
5l2d_Rv0odE,"My question is, will this be inuded in Microsoft E5?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,This will replace Data jobs 😶
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Wow, can we get D365 off the dataverse and onto this and be able to write SQL queries?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,*buckles in for what's ahead*
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Thanks for the video, it's nice and clear introduction. The only point I didn't get is how to centrally manage metadata. Is there any central catalog? Or Fabric relies on Table format of Delta Lake? If so, is there a way to get list of all tables?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Could you please make video or tutorial about getting started with MICROSOFT FABRIC 😊
5l2d_Rv0odE,Future market research may see a downturn. Do those who are knowledgeable about market research have alternative employment options?
5l2d_Rv0odE,I'm assuming I got this because I watched a tutorial on Power BI lol this is beyond my skill but seems pretty cool
5l2d_Rv0odE,"One more question alex, should we attempt the pl300 exam for data analyst, or is it irrelevant now?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Are Microsoft Fabric will be a game changer in the next years and it's time to switch over to a windows or I'm okay with my suite. I'm currently an Apple fanboy using Macbook Pro and my analysis suite is (Python, Tableau, PostgreSQL, Google Analytics, BigQuery) is that suite okay."
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hello Sir, what's your opinion on  International Institute of Business Analysis and it's certifications."
5l2d_Rv0odE,"❤❤❤❤
Hey i am a professional video editor and i can edit these videos in more engaging way."
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Great explanation Alex 
Indeed this is going to ease a lot of tasks"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Alex! Is there another form of payment in Cousera apart from a Credit card??? I mean, the platform says that it also allows Paypal payments (for the courses or annual subscripton), but when I want to pay with Paypal it also ends me asking for a Credit card

Does the possibilty of paying only with my Paypal account exist ????? (I mean, the platform substracting the payments from my Paypal balance) Thank you!!!!!"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Can you please make a detailed video on different data analytics environments such Azure, AWS, IBM, Google and more.
Also how the data world works and the opportunities lies within"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Sorry for the off-topic question, is it possible to work freelancer as data engineer?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hmm, Microsoft One Lake looks like Databricks Lakehouse. Does anyone have the same thought as me?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, how will Microsoft Fabric be different from Azure Synapse Analytics which also integrates various tools at one place?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Thanks so much, though I'm a data science newbie but your video is so good and this is the first time I'm watching you do a video. I will be following you from now and hoping i get better learning about data science. Thanks 🙏"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Super!
5l2d_Rv0odE,Funny. Your audience I think is mostly people getting started right? I for one probably don’t even properly appreciate how cool this is the same way my kids don’t appreciate that phones don’t have cords now. 😊
5l2d_Rv0odE,I actually downloaded this to start practicing on my Data Analytics
5l2d_Rv0odE,What of the recent Tableau updates
5l2d_Rv0odE,I love your smile; it is contagious.
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Also, make a video on how to install Microsoft Fabric"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Marketing. Just like Synapse, most things are concepts or years out before its available. Let it snow ❄️"
5l2d_Rv0odE,This is a really useful tool that improves the efficiency of data analytics
5l2d_Rv0odE,Excellent
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, i hope you can clarify - if we can drop files into one lake, do we need ADF"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"As someone who was learning tableau and was preparing for getting transitioned to analytics from 4-5 months, microsoft has kind of stopped that completely. While doing job search, i can see now that power bi is superior and tableau gonna go down (very down). Shouldve listened to my friend who told me to learn powerbi instead 😅"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Why do people not mention the limitations for individual user of ower BI premium per user
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi! I'm not sure if I've understood the concept of ''Shortcuts'' .. How are we supposed to get the data from SQL ? We uses to do it with Import Mode and it usually takes time when we are bringing historical data..

Does this change with Fabric ? I won't need to use import mode or something like that to save time?

For example I work for a company which has the Database in RDS and I'm not sure if this could help us or not as this is new and I'm exploring what I can do..."
5l2d_Rv0odE,I need it.
5l2d_Rv0odE,Would you make some videos on Azure?
5l2d_Rv0odE,"The more you go into Data Analysis/Science the more it gets more interesting 🙂
I'm really enjoying this 😻❤️"
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Alex the Analyst, will this new Ai tech replace data analysts in the future?"
5l2d_Rv0odE,I think over time small to mid size companies can manage their data analysis themselves with very less workforce and not outsourcing to tech companies….and only very large organisations may rely on huge data analysis teams……can’t say this will increase or decrease work force…only time will tell 🙃
5l2d_Rv0odE,Databricks provides the same kinda functionality
5l2d_Rv0odE,Trying to compete with palantir foundry.
5l2d_Rv0odE,"You are right, Alex, in saying this is going to be mind-blowing. Any data analyst knows that the biggest headache is having to access your data scattered across different cloud platforms. If Microsoft succeeds in living up to its claims of providing integrated services through Fabric, it is nothing less than revolutionary. I am expecting a video on this channel on how to use Fabric when it is launched. There is no better person than Alex when it comes to understanding data!"
5l2d_Rv0odE,Wow
5l2d_Rv0odE,"Hi Alex, I am curious to know your thoughts on what tools Fabric will be replacing. My first guess is Tableau"

bDhvCp3_lYw,Do you have videos of all of these is coded on a file and saved it?
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Dear Alex please prepare a similar playlist on numpy,matplotlib,seaborn"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"14:45 run: df['Phone_Number'].str.replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9]','', regex = True) for newer versions of Anaconda. The code df['Phone_Number'].str.replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9]','') has a potential issue. The regular expression [^a-zA-Z0-9] is correct for matching any non-alphanumeric character, but the .str.replace() method now requires the regex=True parameter to be explicitly set when using regex patterns like this. Without regex=True, pandas will treat the pattern as a literal string, which won't work as intended. 🤝"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"At 14.56 when you apply df[‘Phone_Number’].str.replace(‘[^a-aA-Z0-9]’, ‘’)

bDhvCp3_lYw,"Another approach to removing customers we are not supposed to call and those who have no phone numbers:
df = df[(df['Do_Not_Contact']=='N') & (df['Phone_Number']!='')]"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"for 31:37 we can also use df=df[df['Do_Not_Contact'].isin(['Yes','y','Y'])==False] 
its more easier and simpler it means that keep the rows whose value is ['Yes','y','Y']==false"
bDhvCp3_lYw,Very helpful. Thanks for sharing your knowledge !!!
bDhvCp3_lYw,"it would be a lot simpler to remove the rows of Do_Not_Contact saying ""Y"" by just doing
df = df[df[""Do_Not_Contact""] != ""Y""]"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"FYI the list format for drop na of the phone number column is missing the square bracket (list format):

bDhvCp3_lYw,"Your method of filtering is absolutely bizarre. Why not just use the .query() method? Or boolean masking?

df = df[(df['Do_Not_Contact'] != 'Y') & (df['Phone_Number'].notna())]"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"for replacing y with yes, to avoid the yes becoming yeses,,remove the str before replace
           df[""Paying Customer] = df[""Paying Customer].replace('Y', 'Yes')

also to avoid a lot of repetition,you write:
          df[['Paying Customer', 'Do_Not_Contact']] = df[['Paying Customer', 'Do_Not_Contact']].replace(

bDhvCp3_lYw,I learned alot about common things to look out for when cleaning. Thank you for teaching me!
bDhvCp3_lYw,"df['Do_Not_Contact'].replace('', 'N') without .str it is not tripled 33:43"
bDhvCp3_lYw,how about cleaning my room
bDhvCp3_lYw,Instead  of writing 2 you can write n =2
bDhvCp3_lYw,"this should be the first video to start data analysis with cleaning data, then filtering  i need someone like this"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"using Regex this may work too:
df['Phone_Number'].str.replace(r'(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})',r'\1-\2-\3')"
bDhvCp3_lYw,I have 3 years of experience in data analytics so can someone refer me please
bDhvCp3_lYw,❤❤❤
bDhvCp3_lYw,"I need access to the files , I can’t seem to have it download them even after trying to get it from GitHub. How can I download them"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Currently using this video on my fourth day learning to become a Data Analyst.  My lesson today was to learn basics of cleaning up DataFrames, and damn, I'm super excited to have gotten this dive.  Very awesome, thank you so much!"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Alex, very nice video. However, some problems in the final product. Review index # 1 (Walter White). In the original data, this client has Phone number info and blank in ""Do_Not_Contact"" (means N).  Similar to indexs # 11 and 17 (1012, 1018)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"wow, this is really helpful. 
But this df only contains 20 rows of data, we user can import and see clearly on the screen. 
What if we have way more cols and 10,000 rows? Or even 1 million rows of data?"
bDhvCp3_lYw,nice this is my first data cleaning tutorial i finished
bDhvCp3_lYw,Was  that the advance level data cleaning  or that much is sufficient as a data analytics to clean a data
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Thank you Alex for the video and a huge thank you to everyone in the comment section that shared some tips. Together, y'all helped me figure this one out!"
bDhvCp3_lYw,Two words - Power Query
bDhvCp3_lYw,"33:55 ""nvm lets not do that"" 
a programers proverb"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"at 27:44  we can use df[""Paying Customer""] = df[""Paying Customer""].map({""Y"": ""Yes"", ""N"": ""No""}).fillna(df[""Paying Customer""])"
bDhvCp3_lYw,great content and learning
bDhvCp3_lYw,🎉
bDhvCp3_lYw,"df['Do_Not_Contact'].replace({'Y': 'Yes', 'N': 'No'}, inplace=True)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,immensly helpful!
bDhvCp3_lYw,"I hesitate to comment as there are exactly 420 comments...but there is still an issue with the [""Phone_Number""] column. There are duplicate phone numbers for different clients.

I used this and ended with a total of three numbers at the end.

duplicate_mask = df.duplicated(subset=[""Phone_Number""], keep = False)
df = df[~duplicate_mask]

That being said, I wouldn't have known how to do any of this without watching your video. Thank you so much."
bDhvCp3_lYw,Learnt alot
bDhvCp3_lYw,"how i handle synonyms lets say i have multiple dataframes of country data and within those different dataframes the names are differenlty written (United States, United States of America) and i want to standardize the country names"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Here, Instead of looping two times 31:00 ,  just filter df.                                                                                                                                            df1 =  df[df['Do_Not_Contact'] != ""Y""].

bDhvCp3_lYw,"use this to change Y to YES
df[""Paying Customer""]=df[""Paying Customer""].replace('Y','Yes')"

bDhvCp3_lYw,Ah yes Drugs Driveway
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Thank you for the data example, now I can connect all the code snippets that I learned individually and can finally use them together in your example!

Really one of the best exercises I have found so far!
Thank you so much, Alex!!"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"what seems to be a daunting task at the beginning turns out to have an easy explanation with the right tools, thank you Alex !!!"
bDhvCp3_lYw,I am stuck at cleaning the phone number column for some reason it is deleting the phone numbers as well(the numbers) I have tried all the solutions please help
bDhvCp3_lYw,"For the filtering you could have done just a simple filtering like this 
filtered_df = df[(df['Do_Not_Contact'] != 'Yes') & (df['Phone_Number']!= '')]
filtered_df
You would have gotten the same result but in a much more simpler way"
bDhvCp3_lYw,U wasted so much time
bDhvCp3_lYw,Thanks for your tutorial
bDhvCp3_lYw,So helpful ❤
bDhvCp3_lYw,If we have 100 rows then how do we perform data cleaning.
bDhvCp3_lYw,Hey Alex ! this video is so helpful . At 32.30 instead of using for loop I think we can use this  df1=df[(df['Do_Not_Contact']=='N') &(df['Phone_Number']!='')]  to get  the same result.
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Hi, thank you for your videos! I have a quick question. In the steps where phone numbers are being formatted, why are the phone numbers for certain CustomerIDs like 1003, 1012, or 1018 removed? I assume these are numeric values as well, correct?"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Guys, I tried this for the paying customer column
df2['Paying Customer'] = df2['Paying Customer'].apply(lambda x: 'Yes' if x == 'Y' else x)
df2['Paying Customer'] = df2['Paying Customer'].apply(lambda x: 'No' if x == 'N' else x)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"# Step 1: Convert to string and clean non-digit characters
beta['Phone_Number'] = beta['Phone_Number'].apply(lambda x: ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, str(x))) if pd.notna(x) else x)

# Step 2: Format the phone number to xxx-xxx-xxxx if it is exactly 10 digits long
beta['Phone_Number'] = beta['Phone_Number'].apply(lambda x: f'{x[0:3]}-{x[3:6]}-{x[6:10]}' if pd.notna(x) and len(x) == 10 else x)

print(beta)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"in my opinion this is the best way to clean the phone number column:
df['Phone_Number'] = df['Phone_Number'].astype(str).str.replace(r'\D','',regex=True).replace(r'(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})',r'\1-\2-\3',regex=True)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"I have a doubt? you are deleting so many rows because of null values.. is this a correct way to remove the rows which have blank or null values??? is that data not useful??
please answer"
bDhvCp3_lYw,Thanks
bDhvCp3_lYw,Thanks
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Thank you a lot, Alex! ^^"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Use regex=True at 14:56. i.e. df['Phone_Number'] = df['Phone_Number'].str.replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', regex=True)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,that phone number command is not working i took the help of the comment guy but it actually ended up erasing my every column except the phone number one so what should i do
bDhvCp3_lYw,"in place of the loops in the end, could simply query too: 
df = df.query('Do_Not_Contact != ""Y"" and Phone_Number != """"')
df"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Can anyone solve this-  I am having not useful column again on the line lstrip twice, right strip once and then strip 123....and here that column was gone for good"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Hello Alex, thank you for such a wonderful tutorial . I have one suggestion regarding the last part where you are filtering

# Filtering the Data with ""Do_Not_Contact"" Column with N and "" ""
Filter1 = df[""Do_Not_Contact""]==""N""
Filter2= df[""Do_Not_Contact""]==""""
df[Filter1 | Filter2]"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"I don't know, why are you dropping duplicates without even checking if there are any duplicates? Please explain. Thank you."
bDhvCp3_lYw,at 14:53 we can see walter white-02 index have a phone number but it dissappears after the replace command whyy??
bDhvCp3_lYw,Thank you so much sir i have start my data cleaning from you From india 💌
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Is there a way to discover these issues without  using eye checking for these values, like is there a code to find inconsistency in last name column"
bDhvCp3_lYw,11:10
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Sherlock Holmes address is 221b Baker Street, NOT 98 Clue Drive :)"
bDhvCp3_lYw,thank you Alex
bDhvCp3_lYw,It was really amateur.
bDhvCp3_lYw,Is it possible to export this ( once data cleaning is done) to excel?
bDhvCp3_lYw,"For the 'Y' little issue, u can use the Double Quote, like here in the exemple: 
df[""Do_Not_Contact""] = df[""Do_Not_Contact""].str.replace(""Y"",""Yes"")
df"
bDhvCp3_lYw,Thank you Mr Alex
bDhvCp3_lYw,"A better way to format and paying customers and Do not contact ones:
```# Format paying customers
df[""Paying Customer""] = df[""Paying Customer""].apply(lambda x: ""Yes"" if x == 'Y' or x == 'Yes' else ""No"")

# Format Do_Not_Contact
df[""Do_Not_Contact""] = df[""Do_Not_Contact""].apply(lambda x: ""Yes"" if x == 'Y' or x == 'Yes' else ""No"")

# Remove all Do not contact customers
df = df[df[""Do_Not_Contact""] == ""No""]

# Remove all customers without phone numbers
df = df[df[""Phone_Number""] != """"]```"
bDhvCp3_lYw,"Thank you, this is most elborative and simplest videos i saw"
bDhvCp3_lYw,thanks alot for this great video.
bDhvCp3_lYw,thanks for your effort making this amazing video. It helps me alot. I've been struggling on Data cleaning and your video is helpful
bDhvCp3_lYw,"In addition the presented methodes to filter out the values: customer_filtered_2 = customer[(customer['Do_Not_Contact'] != 'Yes') & customer['Phone_Number'].notna()] or customer_filtered = customer.query(""Do_Not_Contact != 'Yes' & Phone_Number.notna()"") or possibile ways, to confert missing values in to Nan: customer.loc[:, 'Phone_Number'] = customer['Phone_Number'].apply(
    lambda x: np.nan if pd.isna(x) or pd.Series(x).str.contains(r'(?i)^na[n]?-*$', regex=True).any() else x
)
to convert yes en nos in 1 line of code: customer.loc[:,'Paying Customer'] = customer['Paying Customer'].replace({'^Y$': 'Yes', '^N$': 'No'}, regex=True)"

IMU1V-JugKo,Hi how can I apply
IMU1V-JugKo,"Hey Alex First, I like to say Thank you for putting out this class for free.  you are an Awesome Teacher"
IMU1V-JugKo,"hi, from NM"
IMU1V-JugKo,"Thank you so much for this great webinar Alex. 
I’d like to ask, is there a preferred path of learning to follow when learning the tools we’d be working with?"
IMU1V-JugKo,"I appreciate the timeline piece... I began this journey with absolutely no experience or knowledge of data... my mindset was total time frame of a year ish...broken down as 6-9 months ish of learning the multiple skills, then few months of multiple projects / updating resume , online profiles... and then few months searching for the right job."
IMU1V-JugKo,"This is an excellent video, I have great respect for Alex. I used to be on healthcare clinical side so it is nice to see I can really progress to analytics when I put my mind and hard work for it."
IMU1V-JugKo,Alex please stop witht the humm aw humm
IMU1V-JugKo,Honestly I did a ECornell certificate for data analytics which taught me only the basics of using excel but not a over all view it was extremely fast paced
IMU1V-JugKo,watching again @NichoasNjou
IMU1V-JugKo,There's no option to save this video
IMU1V-JugKo,I'm from Las Vegas and in a data analytics program and recently found this channel.
IMU1V-JugKo,Thanks for uploading 🎉
IMU1V-JugKo,I’m from Nigeria been watching your videos for like 2weeks now I will like to be a data analyst cause I want to achieve something in life
IMU1V-JugKo,Can anyone let me know what are the courses in IT industry which AI cannot replace.
IMU1V-JugKo,when you will upload next part of amazon web scraping project ?
IMU1V-JugKo,To add to prior:  its specifically Coursera certificate im currently doing.
IMU1V-JugKo,"So u specifically mentioned and recommended one of the following in your live stream: Tableu DA certificate, Microsoft powerBI DA certificate, and AWS DA certificate.
However, how do those certificates you mentioned in the live stream  compare to the Google DA certificate and the IBM DA certificate?  I did research and Google teaches ""R"", whereby the IBM certificate teaches Python.

And I chose specifically and I'm currently doing the IBM because the IBM does Python and thought Python would be better as far as transferable and more widespread program skill.

So how those 3 that you recommended DIFFER from the Google and the IBM certificate?  They better than the Google and the IBM certificate, or they the at the same level as far as educational  and real life practical value?"
IMU1V-JugKo,Great stuff!   Watching this on replay right now so expecting to get alot of useful info!!!
IMU1V-JugKo,Thank you so much
IMU1V-JugKo,"I am re-watching this. I am from Senegal and have 10 years of experience in another domain. However, unknowingly, I have done a lot of analysis throughout the years with Excel. I recently decided to completely switch to Data Analytics because it is truly something that I love. I am in my very early thirties so this is something that I want for my career. Thank you for this video and HUGE shoutout to Alex because his videos have helped me a lot!"
IMU1V-JugKo,Thank you Alex
IMU1V-JugKo,This was very informative 👏
IMU1V-JugKo,"What do you think, how much time does it require to replace humans with AI? Maybe it's too late to dive into this specialization. What's your opinion?"
IMU1V-JugKo,"Stupid question ALERT: How can I learn Excel if I don't have access to Excel, please?"
IMU1V-JugKo,Thanks Alex! I really appreciate this video. Helped me a lot.
IMU1V-JugKo,"I'm very interested, although I have already enrolled in online courses"
IMU1V-JugKo,Alex sir ! I am not clear in career foundry scholarships?
IMU1V-JugKo,Watching again 😊. This seminar was very helpful and important for all data lovers and Alhamdulillalah i have shared it with my university friends.❤
IMU1V-JugKo,Applied for 1200 jobs? Damn there are like maybe ten at most available when I’ve looked lately.
IMU1V-JugKo,Can people from third world country apply
IMU1V-JugKo,"I think watching the first 25 minutes , are much helpful , other can skip the other 45min as its targeting a very specific group of people , and the probability is very low to get the scholarship , overall career foundry program is too expensive for me and most of the viewers . (even after getting the scholarship)"

I really hope you're right too, and still believe that humans, with their critical thinking and flexibility and judgement can bring something to the table that hopefully AI never will!
Beside learning the basics do you have any other suggestions for somebody new trying to enter this industry? Any specific sector? I am thinking healthcare between privacy issues and liability issues might be one of those that will be slower at integrating AI, do you agree? Thank you!"
FpgkpjSyBOw,jalepinos if every thing goes south i will meet you  alex
FpgkpjSyBOw,A little late but 🌶️
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Here is what you are failing to understand. As AI become more main-stream, a lot more people without data skills will be forced to adopt it, so they wouldn't really need to hire that many people to help them run their company. Yes, people will have to become specialized in the specific areas of data  as it pertains to their occuption and field. It just like web design and web development. Now anyone can create a simple basic web page and UX design. All they have to do is tweak things around. This jobs wont go away (yet), but the barrier to entry will be low, and eventually it become more main so that the average person will have better understand of how to use it, without really become an expertise. The senior level people and senior/mid level people from other field will only be needed,"
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶️
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Jalapeño 🌶 Question for you, Alex: Considering the current tech bubble, which is temporary, and the development of AI, which is permanent, Data professionals with experience are going to compete with the inexperienced newbies. Do you think the barrier of entry is getting higher in this field? I'm considering changing careers, but I'm not sure if this is a wise move."
FpgkpjSyBOw,I want to be data analyst but i don't know if AI will replace everything in the future i'm afraid of loosing time on this field instead of studying something else. could u gimme an advice?
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Hi Alex hope you're doing fine.
I'm from India and currently pursuing Google Data Analytics Certification as you recommended that in your video. I'm a fresher and I don't have any experience. I have done BCA so I have a IT background.

I'm very scared of this whole Chat GPT and AI thing. Some say that we don't have to worry and some say that it will take Data Analyst and Data Science job and I'm super confused on whom to trust.

Please help me. I'm so worried. Should I take another field like Full Stack Developer or something else. Please help me. 

P.S - Please like this comment if you've the same question in mind."

I’m considering leaving my civil engineer role and study data analytics  to improve my work/life balance.. this video helped me a lot! However I’m still unsure ..

FpgkpjSyBOw,"I think AI can help out a lot to get more done. However, companies looking to save on money by cutting jobs are the only thing that is worrisome."
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Hey @Alex if let's say a company pays 1 guy to use AI to do data analytics and the company also pays for subscription of about 10 plugins of A.I which costs about 500$ lets say and pays the guy about 2000$ per month.
Then it's still a win win for company and businesses rather than paying an entry level analyst 5k a month.."

I have had the same ""aha"" moment about the future of what higher education is going to look like in the future. So much of the infrastructure that exists today will become obsolete. In my opinion, it already is. It's probably the elephant in the room with college administrators, the thing they're afraid to say out loud.

FpgkpjSyBOw,"Alex, can we have a regular live connect and understand and discuss more on Data Analysis and any new things.. Others would agree"
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Alex, could see some worry on your face :( AI can evolve lite anything not years but months.."
FpgkpjSyBOw,"AI will be like to the analyst like the drill was to the construction worker. The panic of ""well they don't need humans to turn screws now, a machine does it so much faster"" may have been true on the surface but what it really did was just make the workers live easier and let us do more work faster. AI like a drill, still needs to be held by a human.🌶 Great video, very honest and I agree with your sentiments, particularly industry expert turn analyst being a big thing. Like Ben Affleck said to Michael Bay during the shooting of Armageddon, ""wouldn't it be easier to teach astronauts how to drill?"""
FpgkpjSyBOw,"🌶️ put off watching this video due to being nervous as I’m breaking into analytics, but this was very insightful and did help put me at ease. Thanks for all your content!!"
FpgkpjSyBOw,"I completely agree Alex. I am in school right now for software development, and I have been wanting to pursue data analytics (thanks to you lol). I have been really scared about tech layoff's and AI taking over, but you have brought me a bit of comfort. Thank you for being honest. I think that AI will be a great tool for us to use."
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶Thank you. Iam considering switching careers from procurement and business development administration to either Data Analysis or UX/UI. I have been profoundly concerned of spending months learning all there is to know about these fields and ending up jobless. Your  video was a great watch and i appreciate your nuanced insight.
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶️
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Jalapeño. I agree - we need to take this seriously- and I am a firm believer AI  will be a complementary tool to our work, and we can focus even more time on the fun stuff a not caring as much on all the repetitive tasks as we do today."
FpgkpjSyBOw,Hollapinos
FpgkpjSyBOw,"All of us, could only talk about possibilities. But your point of view, is one that I think worth to be considered. No matter what it's gonna turn out eventually. Thank you for sharing man"
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Jalapeños! I worked as a catalog manager as a contractor for a year and a half, and the company delayed hiring me full-time because I’m 100% sure that leadership was convinced our new “automated” catalog (really just a sql database connected with upstream tools rather than a basic access storefront) would make my job obsolete. I knew enough to realize that it made me all the more necessary! The old database had mistakes that only one person (the catalog manager) let get into the system. Connecting it to the upstream tools made it a pot with a thousand cooks. I was right. But I got laid off anyway probably because the realization still hadn’t made it up to 5 levels up and the whole pot was left in the hands of a recent college grad overwhelmed by it all."
FpgkpjSyBOw,"I think the point that's missing is there won't be a mass layoff of Data Analysts in the next year, but certainly within a few years big corporations will be able to refine their data analytics team down to a few key senior members of staff and they will oversee much of the AI automated data analysis."
FpgkpjSyBOw,"As someone who is considering a Data Analytics or Business Analytics masters, jalapeño! Thank you for this great video"
FpgkpjSyBOw,Absolutely true that ChatGPT is making lots of mistakes. Like really dumb ones that I catch easily as a beginning SQL user.
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapenos from India❤
FpgkpjSyBOw,You're an inspiration to us! Thanks for your valuable opinion about the future with AI 🌶️🌶️
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶I believe all you said is so true. I mean yes AI is useful but the people feeding the AI are most important. They have to understand if the outcome makes sense. 🌶 I am starting my masters in Data Science at 50 becaue I want to be better at my field. I believe my knowledge of the domain in which I work will help me solve major issues there and of course the good thing is that finding my first entry level job will not be an issue since I work in a company that is using Data Analysis already.
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶🌶🌶🌶
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeños
FpgkpjSyBOw,"🌶🌶 I am learning Data Analytics, 1st thank you for the videos, but I am also hoping to have a good career In data. I hope AI is just another tool we use and not replaces us.. Also please send me the link to join your platform and become a student. thank you"
FpgkpjSyBOw,"🌶Just starting out with AI, but this is a very exciting field! Thank you for sharing your perspective."
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeño! Thank you for this very informative video 🎉
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Jalapeños (even though I can’t stand the things lol). Thanks for a well-thought-out presentation, Alex. It can feel pretty scary. Not sure what I’m going to do."
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeños Alex!
FpgkpjSyBOw,🌶️🌶️🌶️
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeños!!😊
FpgkpjSyBOw,"Tech industry is messy and fun. You just have do an inventory of who you are, what you like before thinking of what to learn.  And many things you have to just skip. Yes AI is will be essential, but not all of it.
 At the end there is no guarantee that you will succeed if you constantly learn and learn, because unlike a robot you are a human. You will have an age, a life, a familiy situation in this game. 

Me. I got into Business Intelligence in 2012. I learned old school BI and the principles of data warehousing. SQL was king. Python was good to know, then but C# better. Then my speciality became BI reports.  Big data came, i didnt jump on board.  Data Analyst roles came but I did jump on board. They sais much would would die, but as we know this is not the case. 
I still call me only ""BI developer witin Microsoft stack"". I am not that attractive in many roles now.But for those roles I want (Power BI combined with Azure cloud migration) I enjoy them, because I feel I have made a craft of my skills now and perhaps found employers what suits my well being and happiness  rather than all the time my ""career ambition"". I still have jobs.  To peole who feel AI  stressed id say:

1) Think of economy and the businesses you like to work within. How would AI be used in them?
2) Think system architecture, learn achitectural aspects.
3) AI + regulatory aspects within 10 years.
3) Learn testing and error handling in general. 

AI is here to stay but will be another part of companies ecosystem. 
Dont worry! They have big marketing out of amazing people like us because we worry too much :)"
FpgkpjSyBOw,in 🌶i trust
FpgkpjSyBOw,This is so true.  People call me about a tool that is not working correctly because they really don’t understand how to use the tool.  You are absolutely correct!  They realize it’s not just turning it on and voila here’s the result.
FpgkpjSyBOw,Jalapeños. Thanks for sharing your thoughts! 🤝🏻

6jtS3Hz19kc,chatgpt update to sep 2022 knowledge
6jtS3Hz19kc,artificial intelligence is going to transform our lives significantly before 2030
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Bard is still a kid to GPT, It generate wrong answers and it's not clever as GPT"
6jtS3Hz19kc,How can I use google bard with ios siri shortcut?
6jtS3Hz19kc,I'm totally having problems with Bard. I've had 1 good day with Bard. Now it's just garbage. What happened?
6jtS3Hz19kc,The *last* thing I want is AI in my search. No way to even begin to understand the biases and SEO that is going to be hiding some things and boosting others. Yet another downspiral for the net.
6jtS3Hz19kc,If you asked me before you did this I would have told you to do a ketogenic diet then fast.  It makes sense right!
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Fasting is not good for 48 Hours you need to do at least 3 days, at 2 days your resting metabolism will drop but at 3 days it ramps up!"
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Despite all the hype Bard is getting, I'm still finding Bing to be a better product, side by side.  It already does many of the ""new"" features Bard just announced."
6jtS3Hz19kc,"please how did you grow your channel to over half  a million subscribers. thanks, if you would like to share"
6jtS3Hz19kc,bard is way more better now!!!
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Bard is getting better and smarter now, I'm also using and training it, feeding it with correct information, if i happened to spot a mistake. Chatgpt is already ahead of bard when it comes to accuracy, but chatgpt 4 is paid. I currently use both, because bard has the current data and latest news that i need. I don't have access to chatgpt 4 yet. But bard is definitely ahead of bing now. And bing is still stupid and boring."
6jtS3Hz19kc,I would wait Google Bard to have plugins and not trust shady OpenAI because they cant let you use Plugins with chat history turned off. The need data why? they sell data?
6jtS3Hz19kc,"At least as far as coding goes, the code Bard produces for me is often broken or at least not as good as the results I get from ChatGPT 4. So, as an OpenAI Premium Customer, ChatGPT is still leagues better than Bard. It may be better than GPT-3.5-turbo, I am not sure about that."
6jtS3Hz19kc,"bard is nowhere near gpt, is not better and it extremely exaggerates and makes up facts if it can't find what you're looking for. google has been terrible with it's projects and has scrapped countless numbers of them so it's not surprising their AI isn't that great. there's so many google employees out here simping for this too and leave very obviously fake or generated messages about how it's so much better than got but no explanation hoe or it's extremely vague. it's not unusable anymore, but if it's going to make things up then what's tye point?"
6jtS3Hz19kc,Bard is still pretty twrrible for cosing. Ive gried to get it to make simple models of physical phenomena like magnetic feilds and it continually returns code with undeclared variables and nonsense symbols. Atill needs a bit of work i think
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Tried using the same command prompts for Bard but only got:
""I'm just a language model, so I can't help you with that."""
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Just imagine if there was a group of people that had been trying to rule the whole planet, I think we all know who I mean and it looks like they have found something for us to blame when ""they"" take whats left of our freedom"
6jtS3Hz19kc,Can't us bard even though I am in the USA?
6jtS3Hz19kc,"I love Bard because I don't have to pay a subscription to use its latest version, and I hope it stays that way."
6jtS3Hz19kc,"First we will train it then we will have to pay for it

Google business model 😊"
6jtS3Hz19kc,With my use cases bard hallicinates wildly.
6jtS3Hz19kc,Must have really hurt...to make an AI that just does your own job and make it public 😅
6jtS3Hz19kc,Not available in Canada.
6jtS3Hz19kc,The is unbelievable
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Hello Alex, I have been watcing ur videos are learning from you and you were one of the main inspiration for me to get into this profession when I was so many times before thinking of learning data analytics. You were the one who inspired me. Now I reached to the phase of doing actual projects and practice. I wanted a mentor or some advice in doing the projects and I know that u do not have the time to do so. if you could just give me a brief answer that I would get the idea and move on from it. i took the google certificate and they have some sort of steps to ask, prepare, process, analyze etc. I heard that when starting a project I must draw some guidelines or roadmap for myself to work on but as soon as I start SQLing I start to get many different questions because I am trying to analyze and the more I analyze the more I get questions to that need answers. how can I write an effective roadmap for myself so that I don't get lost"
6jtS3Hz19kc,Not available in Germany... Nord VPN it is...
6jtS3Hz19kc,"What I hate about this is, ""Hey we have a cool product, but you can't use it yet"" In Europe that is... Just release it and then talk about it. Great video!"
6jtS3Hz19kc,"You said in the video that you have been using Google Bard for the past couple of weeks and that it has replaced your need for GPT 4 plus subscriptions. However, Google added the PaLM 2 model to Bard on Wednesday. How did you get better results with the older model? I had early access to Bard and I used it until recently, but it wasn’t that great. I agree that the new model is better than the old one, and that Google has created many useful products that will compete with ChatGPT and Bing AI. But I don’t think that Bard is better than GPT 4 overall. It is better in some ways, but not all. Maybe their Gemini model will be better, since bard  is free like Bing chat and ChatGPT 3.5. I think that Bard with PaLM 2 is stronger than ChatGPT 3.5 and it is good enough to use instead of Bing in some cases."
6jtS3Hz19kc,thanks pro
6jtS3Hz19kc,good!!!Well done!!
6jtS3Hz19kc,Awesome ❤
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Just like SEO, Google Bard will need at least 6 months to get trust from users. Chatgpt already got the Authority! It'll take time and a lot of input for us to get to trust google Bard"
6jtS3Hz19kc,I like how Bard would reference the source material
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Hey Alex appreciate your content! Great update and so nice to see some excitement for Google’s push into AI. 

Question, is it available outside the States?? I get an error message here in Canada.  

Have a great day 🌞"
6jtS3Hz19kc,thanks for the video Alex. you are fast man😅
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Bard is really good but it gets confused when it comes to analyzing links. I gave it your video link and Bard thinks it's a Ted Review. Then I gave video link of Dr. Eric Berg and it got confused again.

I asked it if it's a relative of ChatGPT to which it said that they're both children of OpenAI 😅"
6jtS3Hz19kc,please make a video on chatgpt code interpreter and its impact on data analyst job role
6jtS3Hz19kc,Bard isn’t currently supported in your country. Stay tuned. that report I had in my country
6jtS3Hz19kc,"Alex, I'm fairly new in Data Analytics and after watching your and Vu's latest releases I wonder if it's worth pursuing this as a career with these AI resources?"
6jtS3Hz19kc,I really love this review. I need to try out Bard now lol!!
6jtS3Hz19kc,Thanks Alex. This is great!
6jtS3Hz19kc,Noice
JpSMse3eVVg,Thanks!
JpSMse3eVVg,Great overview!
JpSMse3eVVg,❤❤❤
JpSMse3eVVg,"If anyone has an issue like I did creating an index using date for the Ice Cream Ratings table at 1:36, try using df.set_index('Date', inplace = True) in place of df = df.set_index('Date'). I'm guessing the software has been updated since Alex's initial posting of this video. 🤷🏿‍♂"
JpSMse3eVVg,very useful thank you
JpSMse3eVVg,"You made it easier to understand, thank you sir."
JpSMse3eVVg,"When it comes to visualization, Matplotlib is pain in the ass. Unreal how people(programmers) can complicate simple things."
JpSMse3eVVg,"I'm doing this in VSC rather than Jupyter, and the plot does show when running it, only the text version of it. Is there a way to get the script to actually show the plot?"
JpSMse3eVVg,I really enjoyed this video. Especially applying the styles they seemed so cool😍😍
JpSMse3eVVg,"Best Bootcamp Alex ,Love your Videos<3"
JpSMse3eVVg,"I am 24, and I've observed that students often find it difficult to learn new things because their teachers don't make enough effort to find new ways of teaching. Hats off to you, Alex. You are just awesome, making difficult topics way too easy to learn."
JpSMse3eVVg,Hello guys someone could guideme and tell me if reports can be shared or exported for different users?
JpSMse3eVVg,"Alex,How can man make trading robot by using data analyze of the market's Structure ?


Have a nice day by the way^_^"
JpSMse3eVVg,I would have gotten more out of this with a better use case and more explanation of what the charts were showing.
JpSMse3eVVg,This breakdown was amazing!  Thank you!
JpSMse3eVVg,one of the best video i have ever seen in the youtube for visualization of different plots.
JpSMse3eVVg,OOPs 😜😂
JpSMse3eVVg,"Hello, I am a fan in Chinese Mainland. My name is Victor Joe, and I like your video very much. In China, because of the existence of the national wall of fire, many people cannot access Youtube, so I want to translate your video into Chinese and put it on video websites that can be accessed in China, so that more Chinese friends can see your high-quality video. I sincerely request your authorization. Do you think it is OK?"
JpSMse3eVVg,"I'm not going to lie. I've LOVED all your videos up until the Pandas series. I've really been struggling; not because of you, because of me. Alex you're a gem. The ONLY reason I'm making it through Pandas is because of your instructions, which are always so clear and easy to follow. 

As I've worked my way through your bootcamp series I've discovered that the process of coding is like learning all new things. You have ebbs and flows where it's a real struggle as you learn the new material, then you reach one mountain top and get super excited because the material finally ""clicks"", and then you're back at the bottom climbing another mountain. lol I know pandas and numpy are extremely important concepts to grasp in Python. I'm just struggling along waiting for them to ""click"". However, you make it soooo worth the struggle. I've learned SO MUCH already. I appreciate YOU. As always, THANK YOU!!"
JpSMse3eVVg,thanks for the tutorial. its better for understanding if the data is real and can be made sense of.
JpSMse3eVVg,"Hello Alex, how can display Chinese characters for plt xlable, legend and title? Thanks."
JpSMse3eVVg,Shift + Tab isn't working in Jupyter Notebooks for me for some reason. Ever see this?
JpSMse3eVVg,It's really helpful when you attach dataset and code .thanks Alex 👍
JpSMse3eVVg,"Can you measure brain density or brain regions-volume by ""voxels"" (volume pixels) if you previously had MRI scan images?"
JpSMse3eVVg,"Is there any reason why shift + tab doesn't work? I tried hitting shift tab with the cursor in the exact same location as the video, both before and after running the code. The tooltip does not come up for me."
JpSMse3eVVg,i keep getting  attribute err when using the xlable and ylable
JpSMse3eVVg,Hey have you installed jupyter notebook on your computer? I'm using pycharm but Jupyter looks lot more user friendly
JpSMse3eVVg,really love these videos. thanks for all the time you put into them
JpSMse3eVVg,thank you
JpSMse3eVVg,"How would you visualize categorical data on a bar graph? For example, I have a dataset of people's genders and whether they like an ice cream flavor or not. The x axis would be the flavors (chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla). The y axis would be the count of true and false responses. So each flavor would have two ""bars"" on the graph."
JpSMse3eVVg,"I don't understand why someone needs Pandas when they have Tableau and PowerBI (unless they had to)

I mean, if you have easy tool like excel to build, manipulate and create charts and reports, you don't go to SQL unless you were dealing with huge data which isn't the case in 95% of the time 😅"
JpSMse3eVVg,"Thank you for this Alex, you've been an incredible help! I'm still going through the boot camp and I just just put up my website and resume, hoping to start applying to places and getting out there soon!  Thank you so much :)"
JpSMse3eVVg,Thanks for sharing Alex. This has been helpful.
JpSMse3eVVg,Has the code interpreter doomed data analyst role.
JpSMse3eVVg,"Thanks for this, I'm taking the Google advance analytics course. So this will help me out."

TPivN7tpdwc,"""Hi Alex, could you please upload a video on NumPy for beginners? It would be incredibly helpful for me, and I would greatly appreciate it."""
TPivN7tpdwc,You nailed it! Thank u very much sir!!!
TPivN7tpdwc,Can we do 2 dataframes side by side in pyspark? Similar to concatenate here
TPivN7tpdwc,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

Merging, joining, and concatenating data frames in Pandas is crucial for combining separate data frames into one.
Types of joins: inner join (default), outer join, left join, and right join.
Cross join compares each value from the left data frame with every value from the right data frame.
The join function is used to join data frames based on specified indexes, but it requires more manual configuration compared to the merge function.
Concatenation places one data frame on top of another (vertically) or side by side (horizontally).
The append function is deprecated and should be replaced with the pandas.concat function for appending rows from one data frame to another.
Understanding these operations is essential for working with multiple data sources in Pandas.

TPivN7tpdwc,Thank you!)
TPivN7tpdwc,Wished I saw this video earlier....I would have saved days of wasted hours with simple concatenate function. Tnk Alex
TPivN7tpdwc,"I don't know if its because I learnt sql first but I feel its more straight forward than python... Also doing this a month later, the append still works without any warning 😅 I wonder python would decide to remove"
TPivN7tpdwc,Just one doubt is it possible to join on any condition other than equality condition in pandas like we do in SQL for example T1.Col1 < T2.Col1
TPivN7tpdwc,thank you
TPivN7tpdwc,Thank you Alex ! Well explained and very simple to understand ! Great as always!! 👏
TPivN7tpdwc,Definitely what i needed 👍🏽

TPivN7tpdwc,Dark mode when?
TPivN7tpdwc,"This is such a solid explanation on this. If someone is familiar with SQL JOINS, they should feel right at home here (with a few exceptions of course). Don't sleep on Pandas, and don't sleep on AtA videos."
TPivN7tpdwc,Alex the king 👑👑
TPivN7tpdwc,Thanks Alex for the amazing Explanation. I learn a lot by watching your video. Are we expecting more pandas tutorials in the upcoming video?
TPivN7tpdwc,"I watched other videos about Pandas, they were really good.
I just wrote a comment here, that was probably deleted and I am not sure why"
TPivN7tpdwc,"Dear Alex,
Thanks for your nice explanation..!"

kky9MMydnOA,Hi ..alex plz let me know is google career certificate in data analytics field helps in entry level data job
kky9MMydnOA,"Hey Alex love your content. If you see this comment,  I would like to hear your thoughts. I just turned 34 this year and I want to change career into data analytics. If I gain at least intermediate knowlege in SQL, Tableau, and Excel, what are my prospects of breaking into a career in data analytics? This is something that has been bothering me for a while and I would really appreciate your thoughts."
kky9MMydnOA,"There is a post graduate program on DATA SCIENCE AND
BUSINESS ANALYTICS from Texas MCCombs. Do you think it’s worth to do that? Please recommend good statistics and python courses for data analysis and science . I have seen the courses you recommended on courseera and Udemy, but if there is anything else please let me know ( any schools/ tech)"

zilfrWwbteQ,I'm in Nigeria and I just find the topic interesting
zilfrWwbteQ,Thanks Alex. listening to you felt you were refering to persons like me : retired banker now 64 with several years of banking IT and Software engineering and recently a certification in Google Analytics. Getting into the industry has been a big challenge.
zilfrWwbteQ,"For those who actually looking for 7 ways of using chatGPT mentioned in the video title:
1. Teaching yourself
2. Explaining code
3. Generating code
4. Answering domain questions
5. Commenting code
6. Data cleaning
7. Debugging code

p. 2 and 5 looks like duplicates; overall 3, 5, and 7 can be joined into ""Coding assistance""."
zilfrWwbteQ,I'm in Italy and Chatgbt is banned by the government :( I can't use it even if I tried to use with VPN
zilfrWwbteQ,"this webinar was so informative, Thanks Alex!!!"
zilfrWwbteQ,"Please remember you should never use any LLM on proprietary or confidential data, much less anything subject to HIPAA."
zilfrWwbteQ,"Thank you for your wonderful presentation, Alex!"
zilfrWwbteQ,"too much nonsense talk, not enough substance"
zilfrWwbteQ,"Thank you so much Alex! You have got me so jacked on Data everything! Appreciate your delivery. 

AI is a super strength in the neurodivergent community to add structure to everyday every job every communication chaos experienced."
zilfrWwbteQ,"There are better alternatives to PowerBI out there and as a data analysis expert I am surprised that only PowerBI got a mention! 
Qlik has been in the Analytics space for 30 years and in the Gartner BI Leaders quadrant every year for the last 13 years. Additionally, of the 3 products in the Leaders Quadrant (Qlik Sense, Tableau and PowerBI), Qlik is a leader in ML/AI by a long shot. Otherwise great video Alex - well done!"
zilfrWwbteQ,"Awesome , we need to move forward with this amazing technology"
zilfrWwbteQ,"I started my journey in data analysis in feb. this year and haven't use google even once, always used chat gpt for every doubt, query, and research."
zilfrWwbteQ,AI AI paradigm shift in digital world
zilfrWwbteQ,Thank you for the primer.
PJINexERxOs,"I am towards the end of the second course in the Google BI Professional Certificate course on Coursera and I am appalled at the quality of the product. It is a complete mess. The parts just simply do not add up to create a consistent whole. The lessons, the terminology, the approach to learning, the whole thing is just a complete disaster. Hours of ""talking heads"" and practically no hands-on challenge. Finally the big moment comes and it turns out the Course 2 project has got nothing to do with what you have been learning in Course 2! Total disconnect, the systems and skills you have been learning about are totally redundant! The critical part of the project is just simply presented to you as a 50-something line long SQL query that you can copy and paste from the course. The only skill exercised here is some basic SQL JOIN clause scripting which has got nothing to do with this current course, and it's all done for you anyways! There is nothing for you to do. Manual data transfer in the most basic way with no piping anything automatically, let alone real-time data. I have no idea who this course will benefit, or who the target audience may be. If you already know a little bit about BI, this course will give you nothing useful. If you know nothing about BI, this course will just confuse you beyond repair. They keep on rambling about the amazing progress you have made and how you're almost a BI professional, yet the course fails to deliver one single bit of useful skills development. Shambolic! Shameful! I have no clue how Google can present something like this, or maybe I am under illusions about what Google actually is, but this professional certificate program is just a huge dent in Google's reputation, as far as I am concerned. Farcical! Useless! Is this what all the rave about Google is about? This is alarmingly bad! And this is NOT a free course! They actually put a price tag on it! Pathetic! Just get online and read and watch the native BigQuery documentation or the Dataflow documentation and you'll be lightyears ahead of a ""certificate"" holder from this ""course""! Complete waste of time and money!"
PJINexERxOs,Great! I’m starting my journey now. I’m 37 I’m not to late am I?
PJINexERxOs,"How about the IBM Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst Professional Certificate❓

Would be great to hear your review on it"
PJINexERxOs,what about the recommended experience requested by the course? Is the google data analysis course enough?
PJINexERxOs,@googlecareercertificate is this course available in free?
PJINexERxOs,I find all the google certificates to be lacking hands on experience... this other certificate I'm doing is done on Ryme which so far has given me so much more hand on
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex

Can you do a review of IBM's new Business Intelligence certificate. It uses Tableau"
PJINexERxOs,What if me or my company does not have the tableau software? Is it possible to do the dashboards with i.e. MS PowerBI?
PJINexERxOs,Your channel is amazing! New subscriber . Do you recommend taking the data analyst course from Google in conjunction to this or should I go straight into learning skills such as a tableau or power bi course ?
PJINexERxOs,The difference between a BI analyst and a data analyst is very vague in this Google certificate and is not the norm you'd see being used in the market. They use the term 'BI analyst' but explain the workload of a 'data analyst' and a little bit of 'data engineer'. I'd be grateful if someone could explain clearly how they differentiate between both positions.
PJINexERxOs,Hi Alex...I have total 6+ years of experience in Qliksense+ SQl and I want to be core data analyst.....I am thinking to take Coursera DA courses  ???? And do you think doing these Courses would help me to justify 4-5 years of Python R experience for job?????...Need your help on this...I am in chaos right now
PJINexERxOs,Great platform❤
PJINexERxOs,"So glad you enjoyed the certificate, Alex!"
PJINexERxOs,Turns out they don't teach you Power BI at all lol
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex,
Can you please put tutorials on how to use kaggle, right from the basic? about the competitions and all of it."
PJINexERxOs,You have to pay for this course so Alex what are you getting from them ? It’s a free 7 day sub and then you pay automatically after giving them your credit card number. Take as old as the Internet
PJINexERxOs,"Hey Alex. I have a question. I have been using Coursera specifically Google Professional courses, and IBM and DataCamp so as to do more coding. Also, I have been doing Coursera guided projects as well. My question is which of these two platforms do you prefer: Codecademy or DataCamp? 
Should I invest time into Codecademy as well, for example Data Science Machine Learning track or not? (Since there are projects that I can do for the purpose of building a portfolio)"
PJINexERxOs,"So one of the biggest issues I have is that after the analysis, I'm supposed to recommend actions based on the insights. The data can show patterns and I can highlight those, but I don't often know what actions to recommend. I did the Coursera Data Analytics Certificate and they briefly went over strategic thinking and business, but I still kinda feel lost while I'm doing the capstone project."
PJINexERxOs,Can I take this along the new Google Advanced Data Analytics?
PJINexERxOs,It’s nice you brought up the hands on aspect. That was something I needed to focus on more when I started learning data. It’s such a crucial point!
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex, I came across the the Business Intelligence Data Analytics Certification from Corporate Finance Institute. Please what are your thoughts on it?"
PJINexERxOs,"Hey Alex, I had a few questions. I am currently working a dead end job building car exhaust and I’m really wanting to get into data analytics. Do you actually think I could get a job doing that without a college degree"
PJINexERxOs,whats the difference between data science and applied data science??
PJINexERxOs,"I finished the first course, a lot gibberish talk, second course was more technical yes but it kind of felt off with ETL, then I had flu and thats where I stopped

I did around 4-5 hours a day on the first course and finished it in 6 days"
PJINexERxOs,"This certification is really wonderful 😊. I am still on the first course, which is very theoretical and more of a build up from the Google data analytics. I believe it's going to be an interesting journey 🤠"
PJINexERxOs,Do you think Maven Analytics's course is more comprehensive?
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex.
I'm particularly happy to have come across your YouTube page two weeks ago through a colleague LinkedIn page. I have painstakingly watched your SQL, TABLEAU and Python courses with lots of knowledge gained. I have been managing data for over 10 years with Stata, Excel, Google Data Studio and DataWrapper. I also use Kobotoolbox for data collection. However, your YouTube channel training has reshaped my career. Kindly guide me further as one of your students from Nigeria. I am ready to learn more and get a better opportunity for remote jobs overseas."
PJINexERxOs,"I was thinking...you may not need a whole lot of projects in some of these certificates. Coursera has a ton of Guided Projects for various tools and applications...Tableau has 26; Power BI has over 50; and SQL has over 180 project courses. I know it is nice to have projects included in the certificate...but if they dont, you have the option of taking some of the course projects on the platform."
PJINexERxOs,"hey alex, do you think as a data analysis need to learn sas?"
PJINexERxOs,What is the difference between data analytics and business intelligence?
PJINexERxOs,"I have already completed it, and I think it's good if you are beginner 🔰"
PJINexERxOs,How long before most of these careers are AI'd into extinction?
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex, would learning BI and doing dashboards in excel or tableau be a good way to do some freelance work? You know a side hustle."
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex,

 I was watching your first SQL project video and I wanted to try and do it, but my laptop isn't really strong (3rd world problems 😅), so the SQL server is making it so slow, what do you recommend? Would MySQL or postgre SQL be better?"
PJINexERxOs,Great video Alex!
PJINexERxOs,"Funny, my biggest gripe about the original Data Analytics Course was how little hands-on work there was with Tableau."
PJINexERxOs,Very useful information before taking this program
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex, can you recommend any course in Coursera for learning sql for data analysis? 😊"
PJINexERxOs,"Hi Alex!
Can you please tell me, how useful is knowing Java for working as a data analyst?
If there is someone with an answer to my question, based on experience, please feel free to comment. I would be very grateful.
Thanks!"
PJINexERxOs,Thank you for reviewing it before we can take the course
PJINexERxOs,First
PJINexERxOs,"Greetings Alex, thanks !!"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Alex, did you ever do a follow up video after taking the course? I'd love to hear your thoughts post completion."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Without paying it 40 USD a month via Coursera Plus, we are not allowed to enter labs, are we?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"so, my learning path is IBM DA profession certificate first, then Google advanced DA professional certificate, just because I really love python programming"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is getting the original Data Analyst PC necessary before diving into this advanced one?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I wonder if I could take this one straight without the beginner analytics.. I have some experience with programming and sql but rest of analytics is new to me.. pretty much everyone seem to say that the beginner course is too slow and shallow, but does it have stuff you need in order to be able to follow this course?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can i do it in 1 month in india it's costing $10/m
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I don't know how they can go from a beginner's certificate for data analytics where there's no use of python but R instead and then jump right to an advanced certificate that's heavily based with python. It's like you're being set up to fail. Why isn't there an intermediate certificate for data analytics? Who goes from beginner's to advanced? I no longer believe anything this ""reviewer"" says."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"6:48 C'mon, we use a lot of tools from ML like Kmeans or other types of classification algorythms to do customer segmentation and market research. Don't agree"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"i'm looking to become a data scientist but the IBM data science course has been a bit slow for me, could you compare these two courses or is that apples and oranges since it's data analytics over data science"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can you take this as a complete beginner?
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is it a free certification?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hello Alex, thanks for this video. Can I go directly to this course, without the first one?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Thanks Alex! 
Question: I have no experience in data at all. However, I am interested in data science rather than Analytics.  Which one do you think might be better for me? The Google Data Analytics Cert. Program or the Google advanced data analytics Cert. program?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,brother how can u review a course while sponsored by the teacher? maybe a little biased?????
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Education is generally worth it but this course covers too much. They should have broken it down starting with a foundations course on Relational Data Modelling , SQL and Self Service Data analytics [Desktop and Cloud]."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Thanks a lot for this Video Alex. Im new to the data analysis, I was planing to take some certificates on data analysis. What do you think about taking the ""Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate"" first and than ""Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate""? Or can I jump directly to Google ""Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate""?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Shall I start first with the first course or the IBM one since IBM's one does not have R?
gTf2GLEhKgA,do we get certificate on each course completion?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I just started it, but I forgot most of the last course"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Answer: Yes
gTf2GLEhKgA,"very helpful, thank you Alex"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi Alex, amazing video, ...... 9:30 I am actually interested in taking their advance course because I am more interested in learning Phython, BUT I have not taken their beginners course that has SQL and R.......do you think its advisable to skip the beginner's course?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks for the information and I'm taking the class!
gTf2GLEhKgA,Not sure if I missed it but will the follow up video be posted anytime soon?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I am finishing the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certification. Comparing it to Google Advanced Data Analytics, do you think the courses are the same or is the Google course a complement to the IBM course?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hy, Nicholas, Myself Ajay I've been meaning to reach out to you for quite some time now, I wanted to know opinion on my roadmap for Data Science for Geospatial Industry, I will not waste your time I will share what I am doing write now and what are my goals are and please give me idea what to do:

I have a postgraduate degree in geoinformatics, but I've had trouble finding a suitable job in the field of spatial analysis. This is mainly because I lacked Python skills. However, as soon as I started the CS50 Python course, I realized there's a whole world of spatial analytics out there (which is essentially like supercharged spatial analysis with data science). I'm currently enrolled in CS50 Python and plan to take CS50 SQL next. After that, I wanted to know if Google's Advanced Data Analytics course is a good choice for someone like me who doesn't have a fundamental understanding of data science and statistics. I'm also interested in statistical learning, but I'm not sure how to go about it since it's currently in R on edX. I did find a book in Python for it, though.

I also have an interest in computer vision applications in the field of earth observation and machine learning for spatial data patterns. Essentially, I want to do what Foursquare and CartoDB are doing in spatial data science, with a focus on image processing for earth observation (although this part can wait for about a year)."
gTf2GLEhKgA,If i didn't take initial course should i take this advanced one directly or is it necessary to take the initial course to learn the advanced one.
gTf2GLEhKgA,Do beginner can take this course
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hi Alex...I have total 6+ years of experience in Qliksense+ SQL and I want to be core data analyst.....I am thinking to take Coursera DA courses ???? And do you think doing these Courses would help me to justify 4-5 years of Python R experience for job ?????...Need your help on this
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hello I have question that 
Is it ok if I subscribe Coursera LITE to learn then I switched to Coursera PLUS to get the certificate?
I want to save money 😢"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Did they cover NumPy, Pandas libraries in this advanced Cert course ?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I am complete beginner, and confused between fundamental DA course  and this advanced DA course, So, which one should i opt so that i can work as Data scientist and land a great job? @alex pls provide me the road map."
gTf2GLEhKgA,Totally excited. Glad they added python.
gTf2GLEhKgA,Did you take the course?
gTf2GLEhKgA,Should I do both? I'm doing my MS and want a refresher on a lot of the topics.
gTf2GLEhKgA,R was shit
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Alex, loved the video!  Is it just me or is YouTube cutting your content short?  Seems like I missed your comments on like the last three courses and whatever you might have wrapped up with...  Probably just me...  Very interested in this Coursera offering.  Cheers! 😎"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I’m half way with Google Data Analytics… I have ZERO exp within the Data Science realm and wondering if I should continue with the Advanced course right after I finish course #1, should I?

Looking forward to nail my first entry level Data Analytics job, but have IT experience as Unix Sysadmin.

Alex, could you please advise?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Alex, great guidance thanks for sharing. I would like to ask you. DO I need to do the Analytics Certif. I have already work on Python, or can I go to the Advanced course, having the knowledge in Python? htanks"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks for the thorough review!
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can i take this course without the google Data Analytics course ? Cuz i hate R And i prefer python
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can you compare this with IBM Data Science Professional Certificate?
gTf2GLEhKgA,Very nice video sir
gTf2GLEhKgA,I don't have an issue with that
gTf2GLEhKgA,Looking forward to it
gTf2GLEhKgA,Thanks
gTf2GLEhKgA,Should I take it without the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate?
gTf2GLEhKgA,I got this certificate after two days.
gTf2GLEhKgA,"thanks for his video that describes the certification really well. There's only one aspect I think you misunderstood. Data analytics is not data analysis : analytics does involve machine learning for pattern recognition, trend analysis, etc"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I'm halfway through the basic google data analytics professional cerificate, should i stop it and switch to the advanced one? or should I take this after I'm done with the basic one?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"got a degree on software engineering, want to start on data analytics, should I take this one or entry level?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I'm guessing you like this course because, well, you know Python. But anyone taking this course for the first time, beware - they go over the basics, but very quickly throw you into scenarios that are pretty complex. And if you get stuck on something or have a question, forget it. There are zero instructors or anyone there to answer those. Nobody. Figure it out or fail. I (a 23 year tech vet) started this course day one, and am pausing for a month to.... learn Python first. And then I'll return to the course because I do want the Cert. Pretty ridiculous."
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is this a certificate or a certification?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Would it make sense for someone to get more hands on professional experience in analytics before taking this course, or is it appropriate for someone who just finishes the first Google Data Analytics certificate to jump straight in? My assumption is that this course would make more sense for someone trying to level up and who already has worked in DA. Thoughts?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"The Google Advanced Data Analytics is amazing.
In my opinion, the name of the program should Google Data Science program rather than Google Advanced Data Analytics.
Because it focuses on Data Science, just like the IBM Data Science program."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Tq, Alex...much appreciated."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I really hate when people say something that makes perfect sense only to follow it up with, ""if that makes sense."" Sorry, just needed to vent."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I'm not sure, if you are working hard it is possible to learn this course even in 6 months. Thank you for video"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can you take the advanced certificate without taking the beginner certificate as a prerequisite? I ask because I want to study Python not R
gTf2GLEhKgA,"The first course was piece of dog shit... So, not gonna get another course."
gTf2GLEhKgA,Let's complete it together
gTf2GLEhKgA,can a begginer take this course???
gTf2GLEhKgA,would i be okay to take this course with no prior experience ?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi Alex, so since they didnt include any advanced SQL courses? Do you think they should have since SQL is such a common skill that most companies are looking for? What are your thoughts?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Hey guys! I'm taking the Google data analyst certificate and I only have A.S degree. Most of the jobs in LinkedIn require a B.S. Is there any change I can land a job when I finish the course? I am willing to earn a livable wage (about $40k) while I'm learning and gaining exp.
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi, if I haven't done the non-advanced now, should I do it? Or can I save money and do this one instead?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Wanted to ask if these courses are updated with the new analytics 4 ?
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is there SQL in this course?
gTf2GLEhKgA,How do they charge the fees. Monthly or per course
gTf2GLEhKgA,"IBM Advanced Data science certification is more advanced than google advanced data analytics !! Also, IBM Data science professional certification is better than google data analytics !!"
gTf2GLEhKgA,I’m wondering if it’s worth skipping right to the advanced google certification. I got my first data analyst internship this summer and I’ve taken stats and econometrics as part of my economics degree. I also know some basic Python. Should I still do the first google analytics course or would I be prepared enough to do the advanced one?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi Alex, for a beginner to Data Analytics, would you suggest taking the original Google Data Analytics course or we can directly take this Advanced course."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Bagging refers to the bootstrap aggregation, a Decision Tree Classification method where you make full tree based on the bootstrapped dataset. It is an ensemble method that is we group the results of these Bags and predict on the basis of combined result."
gTf2GLEhKgA,"so, do i have to take the first course to take the advance one?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Would you recommend I start with the Data Analytics certificate or could I start with with the Advanced Certificate? I have some background in coding but not much in the other subjects.
gTf2GLEhKgA,You are the best
gTf2GLEhKgA,Alex what is your review on IBM Data Analyst professional certification? You are life saviour & love your content
gTf2GLEhKgA,@Alex is this course included in coursera plus package
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hey Alex ,
I'm a data analyst with 2.5 years experience in industry.
Should i go to Ibm Data Science professional Certification or This Google Advanced data analytics Certification.
Please Suggest
Also make a Comparison Video on them ?
Please Reply.
I search on Internet on this topic but i didn't get my answer.😢"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Dude, ngl, i just came across a Data Analyst Job posting on Upwork that i couldn't apply because he wanted some AI and ML models too..."
gTf2GLEhKgA,Do I need to know python to take this course? I know sql and a little of tableau.
gTf2GLEhKgA,CompTIA Data+ VS this cert? Pick one.
gTf2GLEhKgA,Should I take this course INSTEAD of the regular DA course or AFTER the DA course???
gTf2GLEhKgA,I have already completed course with cirtificate but iam confused how to mention that in CV
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi, what do you say about the video of ""the data janitor"" below? Is he right about certificates?

""Google's Newest Scam BI Certificate is Perplexing"" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zETb9NtbV94"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi Alex,i have a question. I started with python recently and I just learnt recently SQL/Excel would be preferable to begin with as a data analyst. I want to start with SQL but i feel i should finish with the one i started (which is python) and then move to others. What do you think"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hey Alex sir.
Which course would you recommend  to data analytics certificates?  
1.Google data Analytics or 2.Google advance data Analytics? (For absolute beginners)"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Should I take the Data Analytics Certification first or just move straight to the Advanced Data Analytics Certification?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hi Alex. 

If you plan to do a Data Science Master Degree which would be better to get the basic skills - Coursera or Datacamp?

Also, Is the Google one best or the IBM?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Do people actually evaluate your work as pass/fail? Is anything scored at all? I'm wondering what you actually have to do to complete the courses. I'm looking at legitimate ways to advance my career without actually going for a full-blown Master's degree.
gTf2GLEhKgA,I’m currently finishing the regular Google Data Analytics course. Can’t wait to take on the new Analytics Course!!
gTf2GLEhKgA,stop your advertisements behnchod !!
gTf2GLEhKgA,Would you still recommend this course for beginners ??
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Question please, I saw 3 videos on Google YouTube channel about the new advanced analytics certificat,  are those video that are in Coursera courses. So are videos available for free except the materials and practice"
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Can I learn this advanced without learning the beginner course? Am just starting up this thing, but I took your sql,tableue, excel tutorials."
gTf2GLEhKgA,Can I take this advance course without taking the previous course that google offered?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"I am software developer already working for a company, c# JavaScript, is it gone help me anywhere? And if yes where?"
gTf2GLEhKgA,Good day Alex. Does this course require us to buy or download any python software?
gTf2GLEhKgA,Is their older course a prerequisite to this?
gTf2GLEhKgA,"Hello guys :) Can i do this one and not the initial certificate? or should i start in the first one? i did some turbopascal on xemacs back in the day, and some math. thanks"
VRmXto2YA2I,Thank you Alex. You saved me in my homework. Your video is really helpful.
VRmXto2YA2I,5:30
VRmXto2YA2I,really clear and helpful!😃😃
VRmXto2YA2I,2:25
VRmXto2YA2I,❤❤❤
VRmXto2YA2I,"Those who are getting error in 2:23 use the numeric_only = True argument in mean function like group_by_frames.mean(numeric_only = True) this will work.
The cause of this error was the mean function in pandas automatically calculate values in non numeric column also so we have explicitly specify it in which it should work...."
VRmXto2YA2I,Great video. One problem I had was that every time I put .mean() it would give me an error. No idea why. Everything else worked fine.
VRmXto2YA2I,6:07  we can do group_by_frame.sum(numeric_only = True) to get the sum of only numeric values.
VRmXto2YA2I,please is there a way to attach your datasets? thank you
VRmXto2YA2I,thanks!
VRmXto2YA2I,"Thanks Alex, you saved me with this video"
VRmXto2YA2I,"at 3:27, Use df.groupby('Base Flavor').mean(numeric_only =True) , it does not run without adding extra variable to mean function"
VRmXto2YA2I,"Thank a lot for your video, it´s great!!"
VRmXto2YA2I,you da man
VRmXto2YA2I,"love this thank you, 2 years ago and still commenting"
VRmXto2YA2I,"Dear Alex,

I'm writing to express my sincere gratitude for your video tutorial on groupby in Jupyter Notebook. It was very helpful in understanding the basics of calculating means for grouped data.

However, I noticed that the tutorial didn't explicitly address how group_by.mean() handles non-numeric data. In the current version of pandas, attempting to calculate the mean of a column with non-numeric values will raise a TypeError.

I found solution that by passing numeric_only = True in mean () the issue is resolved.

I would be grateful if you could consider updating the video to include a note to pass numeric_only = True in mean()

Thank you again for your excellent tutorials ❤❤"
VRmXto2YA2I,just a little update groupbyframe.mean(numeric_only=True) thanks
VRmXto2YA2I,"I need help anytime I try to move from the mean part of video on my laptop all I get is an error. However everything else works. Like sum, count, max, min. Does anyone have any tips for me please and thank you ?

At the bottom of my error says “ could not convert chocolaterocky roadchocolate fudge brownie to numeric"
VRmXto2YA2I,How can i save grouped dataframe to csv but i also need to save index as column values
VRmXto2YA2I,"Thank you, lovely useful content <3"
VRmXto2YA2I,"very few channel has this comment ""greak"""
VRmXto2YA2I,Where did you collect this data from? It looks incredibly thorough and well-organized for its size
VRmXto2YA2I,"Thanks Alex this was a great video. Short, concise and to the point !"
VRmXto2YA2I,"Why did the SUM function give this output?

VRmXto2YA2I,neat content ! thanks
VRmXto2YA2I,"Great run through of the popular aggregate functions. Really appreciate the little summary definitions you do at the beginning of your videos. Example: ""Group by: groups together values in a column and displays them all on the same row"", etc. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!! Happy New Year!"
VRmXto2YA2I,"For those who get error in mean,
df.groupby('Base Flavor').mean(['Flavor Rating','Texture Rating','Total Rating'])"
VRmXto2YA2I,"dear alex, could you please add sort after group by analysis ?"
VRmXto2YA2I,Hey alex... thanks for the wonderful work... i have been following along your tutorials and practicing them but for some reason my mean agg function is not working... the rest of them are working just fine... what could be the reason behind that...
VRmXto2YA2I,"Hi, if you had an issue making a group by with the 'Base Flavors' and  the mean of the flavor rating, texture rating, and total rating.  try this is works :  df.groupby('Base Flavor')[['Flavor Rating', 'Texture Rating', 'Total Rating']].mean()      Next line:   print(group_by_frame)"
VRmXto2YA2I,"why my pandas program in python work like this print(df.groupby(['Base Flavor', 'Liked']).mean(['Base Flavor', 'Liked']))
and don’t  work like this:
print(df.groupby(['Base Flavor', 'Liked']).mean())"
VRmXto2YA2I,"Why the query would not let me run df.groupby('Base Flavor').mean(), unless I put 'Based Flavor' in the aggregation function? However, it allowed me to run the other aggregations without having to include the column I am looking for in the function."
VRmXto2YA2I,Excellent. Much better than edx ibm course
VRmXto2YA2I,"The ""I've spent years researching this"" at the start killed me 😂"
VRmXto2YA2I,"Thank you very much! as always, your videos are very helpful!"
VRmXto2YA2I,"Hey Alex, Hope you are doing well. First to let you know that you have been a great help for me in navigating the data analytics domain. 
You once mentioned in one of your videos that cloud computing is now a necessary skills for Data analysts and that you would explain this in detail in one of your video. we are eagerly waiting for this video. Please make one when feasible."
VRmXto2YA2I,very clear tutorial. nice work!
VRmXto2YA2I,"is data analyst oversaturated? someone said that, wdyt alex?"
VRmXto2YA2I,"What did Boris do, to be the pandas course of choice on Udemy to receive paid promotion?"
VRmXto2YA2I,"3:27 note that to avoid a FutureWarning (and an error later), you need to specify df.groupby('Base Flavor').mean(numeric_only = True)"
VRmXto2YA2I,"“Squiggly bracket” > “curly bracket” 😂

Also the first time I’ve seen describe() with groupby(). Makes total sense, thank you!"
VRmXto2YA2I,Thanks Sir
VRmXto2YA2I,I really like this series and many thanks to Alex for sharing such useful knowledge.
VRmXto2YA2I,"This was very helpful, thank you!"
VRmXto2YA2I,"I am interested  to become  a data analyst  where do i begin, dont you have a beginner  course? Or community  so that we can join?  I dont have any information  about data analyst  so i want to be taught from beginner  friendly"
VRmXto2YA2I,Thanks sir🎉🎉🎉🎉
VRmXto2YA2I,Thanks 🤩🤩🤩
VRmXto2YA2I,Thanks for your great work Alex..!
VRmXto2YA2I,Thanks a lot Alex!  First one🎉🎉
VRmXto2YA2I,
6yNsc7JVPJE,Hi! Would you recommend any SPECIAL software/tools for Documentation and organizing our job? Thanks!
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Very useful summary.  Many good reminders for IT veterans, and excellent advice for those entering any IT career or new IT role.  Just about any IT role involves data analysis, and the advice in this video will always apply.  Business context awareness goes beyond data, of course, and it's great that this is included."
6yNsc7JVPJE,"That’s was very helpful thanks alot, not writing my work for future reference is definitely a thing I must work on"
6yNsc7JVPJE,The only problem with asking questions is I am never sure quite what to ask.
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Concerning the point 5. it happened to me too, especially after the pandemics and I had to come back to the office, while I also had changed company. 

I was not used to work with somebody else close and I couldn't stand hearing all the mess other people do in open-spaces. 

First days have been sometimes annoying, but then I got to it, even if sometimes I have to put earbuds on"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"I actually do a lot of this mistakes,m at my current job. But building relationships actually is one of my biggest challenge right now"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"All I do is ask questions now that I'm older lol, so maybe I'll be ok with that one at least. I self isolate a lot though, so I can definitely see myself doing that one."
6yNsc7JVPJE,Nice one alex!
6yNsc7JVPJE,"I worked as DA once,I was still new
 my boss was s d**k
Refused to teach me anything because he is supposedly busy
Refused to even tell me what do we do in this department

This lasted for 6 months I was literally idle doing nothing except signing few papers everyday

Later I taught myself the hardway 🙂"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"one of the thing I learnt as a data analyst I like to have data buddy we work together to have 1,2,3 I usually do this but listen to you again and I love cleaning data"
6yNsc7JVPJE,What's the difference between data technician and data analyst?
6yNsc7JVPJE,Well…. time to go into work tomorrow and document all of my models 😂
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Great tips! Scoping meetings are very helpful to get all the requirements ironed out before a new dashboard, report, etc. are built out. If a stakeholder can't spend 15-30 min explaining exactly what they need, then it's probably not that important. Documentation and some form of version control is super important too."
6yNsc7JVPJE,"is it not too late for a 28y/o mechanical engr to switch career to a data analyst career? I believe, when it comes to analyzing data, I am good at it. But I have very little knowledge stuff like SQL, python, tableau. 

Mechanical Engr in PH does not really pay well. So I want to switch and look for remote work from other countries. And data analytics really interests me."
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Alex I learn almost everything from your video ,such a great content.
I want  to ask how much time it take me to get a intership or job in data analysis I only able to give 5-6 hour to my study, as I currently a  student persuing bachelor (2year) please answer ❤."
6yNsc7JVPJE,Want more videos like this... thanks
6yNsc7JVPJE,documenting your work is key.. often times there maybe a process that was done months before and you need to attempt to retrace your steps because someone asked a question.
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Hi Alex - thanks for the great video! Learnt good point here :) 
To make it greater - for point 5 - I think it should be ""Isolating Yourself"" (Instead of NOT isolating yourself)"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"I really appreciate this video. I am a future data analyst and this is great advice that I’m making a note of. I will make lots of mistakes as I learn, but perhaps I can avoid these particular ones! Thanks so much!"
6yNsc7JVPJE,Find all the mistakes as quickly as possible so you never make them again so that the worst thing you can do is to not fail
6yNsc7JVPJE,Yep! I've done all of these before too 😅
6yNsc7JVPJE,starting off my first proper Data Analyst role in two weeks and I'm SO nervous! Your channel is super helpful as always!
6yNsc7JVPJE,Bro gives off the vibe that he has a dungeon with 4 people that he tortures & makes drink his pee
6yNsc7JVPJE,As a new data analyst I have done so many of these mistakes myself 😢
6yNsc7JVPJE,"regarding 2nd point ""not understanding business context"", not all people will take it correctly when you ask them why i'm doing this analysis for you and why do you need it and so on, most of them say that's non of your business or you will not teach me how to do my job."
6yNsc7JVPJE,I have a question. How do you not fall into a spurious relationship? I'm sure that's a big mistake in this fine job!
6yNsc7JVPJE,SMART goals are the way to go in ensuring you understand you project.. great video Alex!
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Hey alex hi
Have you worked in decision making problems or corelations and cause and effect relationship insights if yes plzz share your experience"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"In my current job, I made a mistake because I didn't ask questions. But I also realize that when I ask questions fr colleagues I do better."
6yNsc7JVPJE,"I love this video. I needed this back when I started. I still work on asking questions. No joke, I asked a team to clarify how they define a “customer” and that ended up taking the entire stand up. Glad I did and I’m still working on all of these."
6yNsc7JVPJE,"But I'm the type to take my time understanding and thinking then only I can ask questions, I can't think of any questions on the spot."
6yNsc7JVPJE,Good advice.  Thank you
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Thank you for what you do, your YT bootcamp has been more helpful than things I find on Coursea"
6yNsc7JVPJE,I think my issue is that I ask way too many questions 😓
6yNsc7JVPJE,can confirm your assessment 100%
6yNsc7JVPJE,"#1: not asking follow-up questions 0:30
#2: not understanding business context 2:20
#3: rushing to build 3:28
#4: not documenting your work 5:20
#5: isolating yourself 6:45"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Really got value from this @Alex freberg. 
Mistake 1&2 were especially emphasized a lot in the Google data analytics professional course that in my head, I always was like: ‘yeah, we get the point already, can we move on now😂?’
But hearing you talk about experiencing it on the job, I've had a mental reset. Now I'm going to make a conscious effort on working on limiting these mistakes when i finally land my data analyst job.

Thank you so much sir."
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Hi Alex, I really appreciate your selfless act of teaching 💞. Could you please make a video on Data analyst cover letter"
6yNsc7JVPJE,These are great points Alex! i believe bouncing back ideas with 2-3 people is very helfpul.
6yNsc7JVPJE,"5 beginner DA mistakes :
1. Dancing 0:15
2. Not paying taxes 1:30
3. Jaywalking 3:32
4. Using R over Python 5:48
5. Not having a solid foundation or understanding of analytics 6:59
**Bonus Tip: Having a weird haircut 8:00"
6yNsc7JVPJE,Hi Alex is the data analyst role /career  considered high/or over the top stress or just  normal amount of stress ? I am working on making the change into this field.
6yNsc7JVPJE,"I’ve worked as a Data Analyst for 6 months and find this video so relatable! I realized my mistakes after each project for mistake No.1,2,3. I did not fall into mistake No.4, but your vid made me take documenting my work more seriously. I didn’t realize that I’m having mistake No.5, thank you for pointing that out. I definitely need to incorporate my stakeholder into the problem-solving process and get over the fear of not knowing/ get surprised by different opinions. Really insightful vid, Alex!"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Hi Alex,I am a beginner and learning from you and other sources,but wasn't able to land a job yet.Can you make a tutorial on which companies to Target on LinkedIn for beginners and where we might have a high chance of getting hired"
6yNsc7JVPJE,"You would think asking question makes you stupid, but it actually makes you look smarter, because its a sign that your care about details and try to understand the context"
6yNsc7JVPJE,Can you tell what are the topics to be covered in mathematics and where we will use in data analytics and why we have to use it ?
6yNsc7JVPJE,"Its about how approachable your colleagues & managers might be, sometimes being genuine about your shortcomings can be a double edged sword. (can even cost one their job)"
6yNsc7JVPJE,It was really enlightening💡 and I added it to my list as a guide. I remembered my old version while I was watching this video. 😁 I like rewatching your videos. 🙂
6yNsc7JVPJE,Perhaps you could do a video on how to best document your work with examples of what you've done and how you do it now. Thanks
6yNsc7JVPJE,Started my first analyst job almost a year ago now and I’ve run into these same exact mistakes
6yNsc7JVPJE,Do you reply to your emails Alex
6yNsc7JVPJE,"One of my gripes learning to be a data analyst is that the coursera Google data cert doesn't use the 80-20 rule,  20% theory, and 80% practice.  I feel like it's actually really light in practice."
6yNsc7JVPJE,Great advices
6yNsc7JVPJE,Will it automate in the near future ?
6yNsc7JVPJE,thank you it was very insightful!!
6yNsc7JVPJE,Second one is what I still face after being in org for years… it’s I believe the most critical part
6yNsc7JVPJE,Started today through bootcamp videos hoping to switch into analysis domain. Wish me luck🙏🏼
6yNsc7JVPJE,Nice video
6yNsc7JVPJE,Love from Bangladesh Alex 🇧🇩🇧🇩
6yNsc7JVPJE,this is awesome
6yNsc7JVPJE,Thank you Alex!😊
6yNsc7JVPJE,First😂
mBCG9J1TVTc,Sir u look like jonny sins 🙂
mBCG9J1TVTc,Can anyone explain Index in terms of SQL? What is the need to specific the index for each DF? It looks something like a key but not completely.
mBCG9J1TVTc,"After I reset the index using the second method, it basically says 'Country' is not in the columns but its there. I followed his instructions to the dot but still get the error."
mBCG9J1TVTc,❤❤❤
mBCG9J1TVTc,"I resonate so much sir. Thank you.  
This is rightly paced and perfectly in detail, neither too much or too less. 
just loving it 😭"
mBCG9J1TVTc,I just want to know what an index object ype is and how to work with it
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Great tutorial. Thank you. But I didn't understand (neither did ChatGPT) the line of code ""pd.set_option('display.max.columns', 235)"". If there are only 15 columns, why would I set the max to 235?"
mBCG9J1TVTc,I AM PAYING YOUTUBE PREMIUM NOT TO SEE SH**Y ADS. IS NOT REALLY FUN YOU TO PUT ADS INSIDE YOUR VIDEO
mBCG9J1TVTc,very useful thank you
mBCG9J1TVTc,10:35 Actually sort_index() also has an 'inplace' parameter (similar to set_index()). You have to set inplace=True for the underlying integer index to change to the new order. Executing df.iloc[1] after setting inplace=True for sort_index() will give Angola as the output.
mBCG9J1TVTc,why you used '#' with pd.set_option? isn't hashtag for comments?
mBCG9J1TVTc,"df.xs('Australia', level='Country')  met cross section kan je op land zoeken zonder continent te specifieren, geweldige serie, alles gevolgd tot nu toe. Je tempo is top, niet te snel niet te langszaam"
mBCG9J1TVTc,I have always struggled with filtering in pandas because the way it works is so different from that in other languages which I am familiar with. Thank you for making this video which is an excellent summary of the possibilities that I can refer to when I need to filter my data.
mBCG9J1TVTc,"How do you get the dropdown options for df.sort.index()? Do you press a key? Ive tried pressing tab , but get a different menu"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Hi Alex, you mentioned that iloc didn't work in multi-index but as I practice it was not working since we didn't save the changes after sorting multi-indexes."
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Can anyone help? Why after i sort_index, the dataframe wasn't group by Continent?"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"sir, the way you highlight your 'OOPs'. 😂"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Another great video! I'm SO EXCITED that I've made it this far through your bootcamp series. Also, super happy that I finally get to learn about Pandas! I can't wait to finish this series and start on your Analyst Builder courses! :) As always, THANK YOU ALEX!!"
mBCG9J1TVTc,Pretty cool.
mBCG9J1TVTc,Thank you for helping me understand iloc!
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Hi Alex, at 8:14 am getting this error AttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute 'set_options', what do i do?"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"8:18 Do notice that Alex changes it quickly to ROWS and not COLUMNS, he shows the max rows of the table."
mBCG9J1TVTc,anyone else keep getting errors with inplace = True?
mBCG9J1TVTc,Hi Alex - it would be amazing if you did a deep dive on the new Seaborn Objects API. I personally tried it and think it is the future of Python visualization. Amazing video as always!
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Please make a video on Microsoft copilot(AI powered)
It will replace data analysts?"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Please, teach us how to clean data with pandas Great channel!!🤓"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Hi Alex, I just came across your channel. Amazing. I just started doing YouTube myself in the last year or so. Was wondering if you have some tips on how you were able to build such a massive channel in just a few short years?"
mBCG9J1TVTc,I just told my entire family that i learned how to do power bi because of you! Told them also to subscribe!!
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Hi Alex, can you make a video about Alteryx? I heard that they can do analytics automated"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Your SQL tutorial project helped me in getting my first job! I have no words to thank you, I was struggling financially. Keep up the great work!!!"
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Just as a quick tip:

 to see the drop down options inside the parenthesis you have to use: ""Shift"" +""Tab"" and slightly place the cursor in the bottob half of the parenthesis."
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Watching your all videos are finished sir then I download certificate 
In that my certification why r u not signing sir that is valid certificate for me pls reply"
mBCG9J1TVTc,Hi Alex! what do you think about pandas 2.0?
mBCG9J1TVTc,"Hi, Alex! 
How do you open that info panel on 7:17?"
mBCG9J1TVTc,Thank you!
mBCG9J1TVTc,Thank you Alex...!

WizLaDdsHUs,I love your content. I am trying to change my career into data analytics and your video was extremely helpful to help me tailor my cv for a data role
WizLaDdsHUs,"Lately, I have been unable to download the descriptions from the videos. Literally, it does not download whenever I click on the download icon. 
What could be the cause, please? What do I have to do?"
WizLaDdsHUs,Is there a way to get rid of the expand/collapse triangles that automatically appear on the resume template?
WizLaDdsHUs,Thank you so much Sir Alex your resume template has been of a great help in landing my first data analyst job. Bless
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thanks, Alex! I ended up using RabbitResume and honestly liked their templates a lot more. They also have this smart ATS hack that adds hidden keywords based on your role, so your resume gets noticed way faster."
WizLaDdsHUs,I am not able to download the resume from the link provided..It asks to buy adobe premium
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hey Hi,  I wonder in 2025 does this type of resume still works because there are so many ats scanner AI these and that. Just curious like how the ats keywords works really"
WizLaDdsHUs,"The Github file is not downloading, what is the alternative?"
WizLaDdsHUs,Do these projects include academic projects?
WizLaDdsHUs,Should you include the google analytics course certification or is that the same as coursera and useless to share?
WizLaDdsHUs,thanks so much alex
WizLaDdsHUs,hey Alex can you make resume video again for 2025
WizLaDdsHUs,"Can you create a perfect resume for freshers to land a data analyst job 
Alex sir"
WizLaDdsHUs,How do you make a portfiolo
WizLaDdsHUs,"Great content! One additional question, I have experience with the low-code platform IBM Cognos. Would that be considered another variation of SQL? Or would we consider that a separate platform?"
WizLaDdsHUs,You have not quantified your projects which may get your resume rejected
WizLaDdsHUs,@alextheanalyst Can I add projects from your Data Analyst Bootcamp in my resume as its from kaggle and not a personal project?
WizLaDdsHUs,"Very helpful 
Thank you Alex"
WizLaDdsHUs,What about including soft skills?
WizLaDdsHUs,"Respect Brother,Love from India"
WizLaDdsHUs,Thank you 🙏
WizLaDdsHUs,Please what is the link to download sample of the resume?
WizLaDdsHUs,"thank you so much, very good tips"
WizLaDdsHUs,"If I have an internship for 14 months, do I include it in experience section or achievements/certificates section?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"I have 3 years of experience working as a Data analyst. I have obtained some certifications in past few years including a Data analytics bootcamp, Google data analytics certificates, Udacity Business analyst nanodegree. Where would be a good place to add a section and add those certifications? Should I list them in a separate section or add to the Education section?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thank you so much, Alex."
WizLaDdsHUs,I even tried to check the description box but I am unable to see any CV template
WizLaDdsHUs,Please sir can you please show us the template you use please
WizLaDdsHUs,"Seeing this resume compared to mine , I just got so embarrassed 😂 no wonder I got rejected"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Is it necessary to put all the projects of one tool or it should be mix. For instance I have most of my portfolio projects in Power BI and I solely used Power BI for Data Cleaning, Data Engineering and  Data analysis & Visualization. Or should I include 1 from Python and 2 from Power BI and 1 from Excel? Kindly Answer"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Always on time, always selfless. Finding you is a blessing."
WizLaDdsHUs,This is the greatest video about creating a perfect DA Resume I have seen so far. Thank you for helping us all
WizLaDdsHUs,Are these projects done in a playlist?
WizLaDdsHUs,"thanks, i remade my resume"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Alex, you are God-sent! I am sincerely thankful for all the time and effort you put into helping the rest of us! The resources you provide, and how approachable/easy-to-follow your teaching is makes this journey of transitioning into data much less daunting! You are a great guy 💚
Thank you for doing what you do!"
WizLaDdsHUs,Thank you so much Alex!
WizLaDdsHUs,"As a fresher, should I include internships in the work experience section, or should I create a separate section named ""Internships""? Do internships count as work experience?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thank you so much, Alex, for always providing valuable information! I thought of your channel first when I needed to update my resume, and here it is <3"
WizLaDdsHUs,hi there! please is it compulsory for a resume to fit into one page?
WizLaDdsHUs,"greatly helpful video Alex, I have just switched to the DA career from finance. These tips have greatly helped me. Now seeking new opportunities. I want to know if a two-page resume is offensive? Based on your template can I go for two pages or just stick to one as it is mostly loved by hiring managers?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"What's your advice for someone who's only worked in warehouses? I won't have any experience, and coursera would be my only proof that I'm capable."
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hello Alex, I just wanna know what title should I put into my resume as fresher, should it be Entry Level Data Analyst?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"I need help with this. I have no work experience; apparently, the projects I started working on got stopped halfway, and I never got to skill up or anything because I've been jumping from one job to another halfway through. How can I make a CV for data analyst roles, which I aspire to land in? Please help."
WizLaDdsHUs,How would an experienced resume differ from this sample?
WizLaDdsHUs,What are your laptop recommendations to prepare and practice for data analytics
WizLaDdsHUs,Well Appreciated Alex!!!
WizLaDdsHUs,"This video is very helpful! I would really like to have the free templates but the links take me to a screen on your site with a large white box, devoid of text or anything else. Can you help. please? Thank you so much!"
WizLaDdsHUs,"FANTASTIC video! All your content on portfolio projects, building a website for portfolio projects, LinkedIn tips, and resume advice is SO helpful/valuable and makes you stand out as the BEST resource for people trying to become a data analyst. I cannot THANK YOU enough for all of your energy, time, and effort putting these videos together. I just completed your bootcamp series and wanted to say, you are a wonderful person and AMAZING teacher/instructor. I've taken over 220+ college credits over the years getting a bachelors, masters, and phd. You are by far the ABSOLUTE BEST instructor I've ever had. Period. As always, Alex THANK YOU!!! Can't wait to start your courses on the Analyst Builder next!"
WizLaDdsHUs,Thank you so much for this Alex!
WizLaDdsHUs,I noticed that you don't have a summary. Isn't that something that employers would be looking for?
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hi Alex, I have completed my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, which is undoubtedly relevant. Should I place it at the top of my resume?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hi Alex, I would like to ask if the Resume is ATS friendly?"
WizLaDdsHUs,Thanks for the video Alex - incredibly helpful! :)
WizLaDdsHUs,Approx how long did this take?
WizLaDdsHUs,I am not able to download the template kindly helpout
WizLaDdsHUs,data analyst entry level resume here in your videos?
WizLaDdsHUs,"yo yo Alex, big fan here, quick question. I have 6+ years of experience as a data analyst and am currently working at a Fortune 500 company in the US as a Data Analyst III and I'm the Reporting and Analytics People Leader. After 6 years with this company, I decided to move on, so my CV is not updated :) but my question for you is:
- with someone with experience, do I still have to put Skills and Projects on top before Job experience?
- if the answer is YES to the above question, do projects should be my own projects, or projects at work will suffice?
- Lastly, with someone with experience in the field, do I even need projects portfolio?
thanks for what you do!"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hi Alex, is it recommended to add our photo in the resume?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Alex, How can i work as data analysis remotely from the Middle East in Western job markets?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"You are the best i love you am from Nigeria thank God for meeting someone like you, we can make this world a better place"
WizLaDdsHUs,Thanks Alex...Finally i made my cv with your help...
WizLaDdsHUs,"How to get the template?
It is not downloading"
WizLaDdsHUs,i am a fresher just graduated in Bioinformatics and i am trying to get a job as a data analyst. What can i do with the work experience section of the resume?
WizLaDdsHUs,what projects do you recommend to include in the Resume as a fresh
WizLaDdsHUs,Not able to download the samples don't Know why
WizLaDdsHUs,This is so insightful
WizLaDdsHUs,Thanks
WizLaDdsHUs,Hi alex hope you doing well just wanted to know can we user hyperlink for linkedin acc or portfolio website or for github in the resume is it ATS friendly?? Pls reply asap
WizLaDdsHUs,"You have inspired me to go for it. My background is healthcare in a patient care role for the last decade and I am ready for a change. I have free access to linkedin learning through my university log in so I started some data analyst modules there with the added bonus that I can get a certificate for my profile when I am done. I plan to start your bootcamp videos, and I have actually enrolled in a data analytics grad certificate that starts in Jan. I know a grad certificate probably isnt necessary, but I have a way to get it paid for, so it makes sense for me to do it. I havent seen much discussion on any of the grad certificates. Im curious what you think about those. It looks good- covers SQL, excel, tableau and power BI, and has a whole course on solving problems with data etc. Given that a grad cert would be directly relevant. Would move my education section up on my resume? Doing so through a university has the added benefit of building a network in the feild."
WizLaDdsHUs,"Just when I was cracking my break, Alex you came to my rescue 😊😊

Thank you so much for sharing"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thank you so much for you videos. The portfolio website one & this one were so great and helpful. I need to finish more to complete your boot camp but your videos, in my opinion, are a prefect complement to the Google Data Analytics Certificate course on Coursera that I took. Thanks again for your content."
WizLaDdsHUs,currently preparing for a final interview for a MI Analyst role and i must have watched about 30 of your videos today. They're in a league of their own. Thank you
WizLaDdsHUs,"If you have a diploma or certification, where do you put it?"
WizLaDdsHUs,How do you feel about certifications from colleges?
WizLaDdsHUs,I just want to know if Alex listened to Preston and Steve while he was at Drexel? :)
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thank you so much Alex!
Honestly, words can't quantify how grateful I am to you for sharing these important and valuable insights and tips and how you have been helping us to navigate through the data world
Thank you so much once again for simply being the best"
WizLaDdsHUs,I don't have experience shall I write certificate in my resume
WizLaDdsHUs,"I CAN""T DOWNLOAD IT FROM GITHUB. IS THERE ANY OTHER OPTION!!??"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thanks Alex!  Appreciate the logically concise layout of the example resume.  Will be using this info very soon.  As always, thanks for the outstanding content you post here in YouTube.  Cheers!😎"
WizLaDdsHUs,"Although I have not landed a job yet, but watching your videos everyday is hopes up for me. Thank you Alex!"
WizLaDdsHUs,Thank you. This really helps a lot on my career shifting. Please do more videos that will help newbies in data analytics like me! Keep it up!
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hi Alex! Thank you for the tips. I have a doubt could you please clear it? In your opinion, can we use both data analyst/business analyst in the header or should we specifically mention the one role? I'm transitioning my career from sales to data and since both roles are interchangeably in the industry, as a fresher what would you recommend?"
WizLaDdsHUs,2nd Resume Template file is not downloading
WizLaDdsHUs,"You’re amazing. Thank you for providing insight, guidance, and actually useful info to strangers! You da bomb! 💪🏼"
WizLaDdsHUs,What would you recommend to put in the work experience area if you have no prior experience? Would I just leave that section out?
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thank you for this data analyst Bootcamp, really learnt a lot. Can we include the guided projects done in this bootcamp in the projects section of the resume? pending when personal projects are completed

PLEASE ANSWER"
WizLaDdsHUs,This is super helpful in writing a new resume. Turns out my resume is not really the problem though
WizLaDdsHUs,Hey Alex! Will you be interested on giving feedback on my resume? Thanks for your time.
WizLaDdsHUs,I am Project Management Office director and have a wide range of experience in project management but I am interested in data analytics and I would like to change my career to become a data analyst. I am still in entry level and starting learning the required skills for this career. I have no projects to include right now in this field. how to write my resume?
WizLaDdsHUs,"What if the only work experience I have my entire life since graduation is unrelated work experience? Should I still include it? 
If I exclude it, recruiters will hate the 5 year gap."
WizLaDdsHUs,Badabing Badaboom!
WizLaDdsHUs,"Hey, Alex am a realtor but now am switching to date analyst how will I write my CV when all my 12 years experience I had is in real estate development"
WizLaDdsHUs,Alex... I'll never be able to thank you enough for this video... Glad I came across this video... Most of the times we end up complicating things
WizLaDdsHUs,"I am really enlightened by the information in the video. Thanks Alex. However, just wanted to know, if the interviewer or the hiring board become biased if we use the help of chatGPT or any other versions to build our resume?"
WizLaDdsHUs,"The project section would be soooo big , because I worked on too many medium to big ones that are all equally important and operates with a different technology"
WizLaDdsHUs,This playlist is the most valuable resource I have come across. Thank you Alex
WizLaDdsHUs,This resumes and projects have helped me get my first tech interviews. I am having my first technical interview tomorrow for a product analyst role so I was going through the playlist again to prepare. I feel like I will fail terribly and embarrass myself but it will be a great learning opportunity. Thank you so much Alex
WizLaDdsHUs,Thanks a lot brother
WizLaDdsHUs,"Thank you so much for the great videos Alex!!
I have a question
Is it mandatory to add timelines for the projects? will it be fine if we add projects timeline within a month or 2 months so..?"
kB7FV-ijdqE,Thanks Alex!
kB7FV-ijdqE,Hats off and mad respect from Bangladesh.🤗
kB7FV-ijdqE,One of the best  teacher on youtube who actually  teaches properly rather than just blurting syntaxes and code.
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Very clear, I like your comparisons to SQL functions."
kB7FV-ijdqE,❤❤❤
kB7FV-ijdqE,Such a quick and easy tutorial tysm.
kB7FV-ijdqE,Can someone explain where do I go to actually create my project. Or how to create a hyperlink to my resume
kB7FV-ijdqE,🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Thank you so much, Alex! Your bootcamp has been incredible, and I truly appreciate all the effort you've put into it. I've learned so much in just 2 months This is the best course I've ever taken. Filtering out Zimbabwe at 6:30 really put a smile on my face! . Lots of love from Zimbabwe!"
kB7FV-ijdqE,very very useful and straight forward
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Thank you for the efforts of posting these videos. Is there a resource that explains the syntax around some of the code? For instance the line:
Df[df[‘Country’].str.contains(‘united’)]

Why are double identifying the data frame? Also why is it str. And not str()?

I think I’m just confused where we use brackets vs parenthesis vs dots and what each indicate."
kB7FV-ijdqE,11:00
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Hi  Alex. In your Filtering using Date Functions video, once the index was set with df.set_index('Formatted Date'), then we should theoretically be able to see all the 2009 rows with df['2009'] or at least 3/27/2006 row with df['2006-03-27'] but it is not happening. What is missing?"
kB7FV-ijdqE,I love your videos and to support you I'm gonna watch other courses  with watching adds on
kB7FV-ijdqE,This video was very helpful bro 😊
kB7FV-ijdqE,hello . am trying to pratice the codes but i am having issues . it saying file location not found
kB7FV-ijdqE,Just what i was looking for! thank you so much!
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Thank you,it's really helpful"
kB7FV-ijdqE,"I am trying to open the file using the 'read' function but it is not working. It keeps showing 'no such file or directory' even when the file path exists? I have tried using file =open(r""file\name"") but that isn't working as well. Can anyone please help?"
kB7FV-ijdqE,very informative one. Thanks for sharing with us. once again thanks.
kB7FV-ijdqE,Looking forward to a Numpy series. Was also too fast
kB7FV-ijdqE,Thank you so much. You have no idea how helpful you have been.
kB7FV-ijdqE,"It`s 10th video which I saw on YouTube, and the first which help me. Thank you very much. Short&clear videos."
kB7FV-ijdqE,great content
kB7FV-ijdqE,thank you!
kB7FV-ijdqE,you are going way too fast man
kB7FV-ijdqE,I love your videos man❤
kB7FV-ijdqE,"great video, thank you."
kB7FV-ijdqE,Thanks Alex.
kB7FV-ijdqE,"I came here because I needed to filter and order some csv files on backend and then send filtered\ordered csv files back. First I figured csv module is probably what I need but it's actually useless for ordering and filtering. Then I though I will just export everything into postgres, filter it there and then export it back into csv. And strangely enough the best way to export csv into postgres using python was suggested to be with pandas! And then I though: 'wait, why do I even need sql if I can manage my data in a dataframe and export  it back into csv'. So here I am! Excited to learn! 
Alex, thanks for the video!"
kB7FV-ijdqE,"I have been doing that udemy course for a couple of days and I stumbled upon this pandas series videos now...  As I was watching it I was like: ""hmmm this sounds very familiar, very well explained..."" And there it is, when I saw the sponsorship part!
This is an excellent summary of the course itself. Love your work man, keep it up!"
kB7FV-ijdqE,Thanks
kB7FV-ijdqE,This is a great video. A lot of useful information condensed into such a short video. Great work.
kB7FV-ijdqE,the best pandas filtering tut i have watched. clear presentation  and straight  to the point
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Thanks for this, Alex! I’m a R user wanting to pick up Python as well, and this a great overview of panda’s syntax. As a SQL user as well, those comparisons are also helpful!"
kB7FV-ijdqE,sir also add pandas profiling in this playlist
kB7FV-ijdqE,Hello my dear online teacher Alex Freberg. I want your advice about Python practicing. I mean you shared about best courses on YouTube or Udemy or any other courses. But  i need best sources for practice python or maybe method for example projects. What is your advice about it. Honestly i would like one little video about it))  Thanks for your attention beforehand.
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Excellent work sir @Alex The Analyst  your videos are helping me learn more , also if possible could you make a playlist for us for the hands-on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in different sectors (Finance, banking,stocks,insurance,healthcare,supplychain,etc) so that these are helpful for us to start our career in this domain 

expecting you would make these too for us to help 

Thanks a lot sir!"
kB7FV-ijdqE,man is just cool. thank you very much
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Dear Alex, thank you for your video. How can I download your database set?"
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Thanks for the video Alex. Python is the only fear I have now.

I've been able to do more with other tools, but I keep coming across new stuffs in python.

I have been learning python for a while, but the more I learn, the more I feel it's becoming more complex, and it's scary 😢"
kB7FV-ijdqE,Do you do any videos on business analysis?
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Great content, now I have a much better understanding of pandas. Gracias"
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Hey Alex, I purchased that course a long ago. But the Instructor is not engaging. He doesn't reply to specific questions for 2-3 years. 
That's why I prefer Maven Analytics."
kB7FV-ijdqE,"Excellent video. If I could give it 2 thumbs up I would. I especially like how he gets right to the point and doesn't waste the viewers time.  The whole video is filled with useful information. Tutorials where the host spends 10 minutes telling you what they're going to tell you, before they tell you are infuriating. So are videos that are an hour long but only have two or three actual pieces of information in them. This was the perfect video on the topic of filtering columns and rows in Pandas. Thanks Alex."
kB7FV-ijdqE,Thanks Alex
kB7FV-ijdqE,can't donwload your dataset bro
kB7FV-ijdqE,thank you so much for this
kB7FV-ijdqE,Thank you Alex...!
kB7FV-ijdqE,Hey Alex any thoughts on Alteryx
kB7FV-ijdqE,U r awesome 😎
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Hi Alex! thank you for your videos. I just discovered your channel and unfortunately missed the Q & A!  I'm currently looking into transitioning into the tech sector as a Data Analyst. I was wondering whether you could shed some light or point me to a previous video on the different types of 'analysts' for example there are business analysts, insight analysts, marketing analysts etc etc"
dFA0E-6xT_M,Thank you brother.
dFA0E-6xT_M,How come you haven't done any R projects
dFA0E-6xT_M,$60/mo for Coursera if you need unlimited access to diff courses
dFA0E-6xT_M,"My motivation is passion for numbers; got a degree in chem, however never used it; it only helps me to have a diff perspective 😊"
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Hi Alex,
I am following you since last year and I really benefited from your content."
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Please, I downloaded SQL and installed but I got stuck when I was told to Input a Password. I tried inputting different passwords but it didn't work. How do I proceed ?"
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Hey alex, love you content....can you please make a video on how a data analysis can earn from Freelancing and what services he/she can provide as a freelancing data analyst..."
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Hi Alex, I am trying to do the SQL exploration portfolio project and for some reason, I could not import excel files to ssms. I tried using ssis too. But does not help. can you please suggest me any other way."
dFA0E-6xT_M,"I missed the live stream, but watched everything you had to say. 

I’m actually just starting the whole transition from graphic designer to data analyst. I feel that one of the harder things for me would be how to re-word my resume into a data resume when all my experience is definitely not data related. The only tool that comes close is excel, and that was just pulling reports from a program and uploading the file to the cloud.

So I’m just unsure of how I should go about that, but maybe your future video will touch upon that.

Other than that, I look forward to you future videos and alllll the ones in the boot camp playlist!"
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Waoo,, that advise about skills at the time to apply for a job, is super helpful  !!!!!!!!!... 

Thank you!!"
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Would you not recommend joining an organization as the first/only data analyst? I’m thinking about growth, mentorship and expectations of the job."
dFA0E-6xT_M,"I have good knowledge on python,sas,vba,powerbi,sql can suggest how to get work in online other than fiver, upwork"
dFA0E-6xT_M,I prefer the night-time streams.  I missed this one and I was super bummed 😥  Can't wait to finish your boot camp and I look forward to your actual lesson content!
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Hi Alex, 

I was hoping to be online during your session but found it difficult to stay awake until 1 am ( local time).

Question i wanted to ask :

 how much knowledge should i know in Tableau prior to learning Power BI. I have completed two courses in Tableau (Kirills, A-Z, & advanced) on Udemy. I have worked on your portfolio projects and about to work on the coursera portfolio ones you have discussed on youtube. I have been listening to the various Tableau user groups and realised how complex it can get. I am planning to get to the advanced level as it opens up a heap opportunities. Is it practical to learn both to an an advanced level. A big thank you for your mentorship on the channel, Prasad"
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Hi Alex, enjoy your videos. Thanks for providing all the content on Data Analytics. You mentioned using a Google Chromebook to learn data analytics. Would you recommend that over a MACBook ? I already own a MAC but wonder if it’s the best product for running the programs"
dFA0E-6xT_M,30:00
dFA0E-6xT_M,I'm in a manufacturing company as a department supervisor. How can I get experience at work?
dFA0E-6xT_M,"Maybe you can have your end to end project videos be themed.  Like one for a marketing analyst, another for a financial analyst, etc."
dFA0E-6xT_M,How relevant are SPSS and SAS in Data Analytics? I haven't touched those in a while.
dFA0E-6xT_M,I think I missed the live. Someone just posted this in a group that I belong to. I popped right over. Maybe I’ll catch it live next time. 😊
dFA0E-6xT_M,Hey Everyone!
dFA0E-6xT_M,I have seen two of your videos and really liked me and they've been very helpful. Many thanks for sharing
dFA0E-6xT_M,unfortunately missed your live session today. I had some many questions. I will look through the video and then post. Thanks for the efforts and really appreciate the efforts.
dFA0E-6xT_M,Which course is best is it data science or data analyst plz help me to sort this query plz
dFA0E-6xT_M,Alex please do more bootcamps and  Portfolio series looking forward
dFA0E-6xT_M,Top 3 Python courses?

I'm kicking myself because although I couldn't answer how to do it using python, I could have pivoted to talk about joining data using SQL, and I didn't even think to pivot the question... It's a learning opportunity that I won't soon forget."

dUpyC40cF6Q,"I love the tutorial so far but the line: print(data_frame.loc['Uzbekistan']) does not work neither in jupyter, nor in VSO."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Amazing tutorial.
thanks for straightforwardly explaining this.
I want to request you to please make a video on Mathematics used in Data analysis."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Hi Alex, What if my csv file which is separated by a comma has uneven number of columns, can we import it using pandas?"
dUpyC40cF6Q,Why you didnt show how to set everything up???? xD
dUpyC40cF6Q,"As a python beginner without any programming background, I watched a lot of videos on youtube and found them very hard to follow. This video is the best I've ever watched so far! Thanks!"
dUpyC40cF6Q,"In the end of the video, I believe it should be: df.loc[df['Country'] == 'Afghanistan']"
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Can anyone please explain how to get ""copy as path"" in Windows right click context menu?

I don't think it is there by default!"
dUpyC40cF6Q,Datasets links not working
dUpyC40cF6Q,Very fantastic way to teach.
dUpyC40cF6Q,"I've been running this in python on my local machine, for read excel to work you need to install openpyxl. It worked after doing this, sheet_name is case sensitive."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"great video, new for me is the ""copy for path"" lol, used to do that different way or ""type manually"""
dUpyC40cF6Q,"What if your text file doesn't contain a perfect table.  For example, I have a huge text files that looks like this:

dUpyC40cF6Q,"Hello, great videos, do you know how to use python pandas to read excel files from sharepoint online, using certificate or PKI or x509? I have tried everything and cant get access, keep getting 401 errors…thanks"
dUpyC40cF6Q,Is it the first video of pandas??
dUpyC40cF6Q,"how would I manipulate the data frame such that I could set a min and max? lets say in the case of the example above, ranking from 12 to max 35"
dUpyC40cF6Q,Brilliant tutorial. Thanks.
dUpyC40cF6Q,kept getting an error when trying to import the excel file. Not sure what is going on. Help? kept telling me persmission denied
dUpyC40cF6Q,Like always this video is very good. But when i try to read the Excel. But why it can't read it? Should i download the openpyxl?
dUpyC40cF6Q,"No matter how far I get in data analytics, I will always think of black and white bears first when I hear pandas. Where the heck did the name come from, anyway?"
dUpyC40cF6Q,so i got an error when importing 'sheet1' i then renamed the sheet to somthing else and then it worked
dUpyC40cF6Q,Nice channel you have got!!! Thank you!!!
dUpyC40cF6Q,"for some reason i am not able to download these files from github, the raw files end up not opening the page and the download button doesn't work."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Great videos MAN , one thing i struggled with was no module named panda , would have helped if you told us how to download the library  or maybe its because i am doing it in vs code : still great vidoes man u are G.O.A.T"
dUpyC40cF6Q,You teach in the most simple way. Thank you for zooming the screen so one can see the text clearly.  God bless you.  Keep up the good work
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Thank you for being a truely outstanding teacher. Your passion for impacting knowledge and your dedication to your students is obvious in everything you do.
I feel so lucky to learn from you sir. I hope you know the priceless impact you are making in so many lives.
Sir, please I have a humble request.
I would appreciate if you would make a video of PYTHON in Data Analysis. A complete series. Much love sir....."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Great video. It's been really hard to find good Python videos. It seems like EVERY Python for Data Analytics course that I buy has a teacher that comes from the computer science world, and talks about it that way. Your approach makes is SO much easier for us non-computer scientists to learn!"
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Great video! Thanks, keep moving forward!"
dUpyC40cF6Q,"thank you Alix for every thing 
I want to ask you smth  how can I download the txt , json , csv files form gethup  ?"
dUpyC40cF6Q,"13:26 how does the comand knows that it has to do changes for jason file, you did not mention that show all the columns for Jason file."
dUpyC40cF6Q,sangat bermanfaat
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Hello Alex, I would like to know your opinion on Data Analyst freelancer jobs. Is there actually such a thing? 
It would be great if you'd share your thoughts on this."
dUpyC40cF6Q,How do I read .dat file?
dUpyC40cF6Q,"This is how people should teach - easy, smooth, and clear breakdown of concepts."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"This is the thing I was looking for. I had wish to someone make it more easy.
This is my first step 🚶‍♂️ to learn python. 
Lots of love ❤️ for this video"
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Alex, thanks for the video. Nicely explained. Looking forward to future videos."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Hello Alex, I have been going through your videos and learned a lot from them. Really thankful for it. Just wanted a little bit of your time to review my Resume which I have made. Your advice would be of great help. Looking forward to your time. 
Thank you."
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Great video Alex as always, still can’t believe how much I have learned from you and your videos in the last 6 months! Definitely tunning in to brush up and keep it fresh! Bring back the intro!"
dUpyC40cF6Q,Chris Bruehl from Maven Analytics has an outstanding Pandas and NumPy master class course. I would recommend that over some unknown course.
dUpyC40cF6Q,"Great video from Alex as always. For those who don't know how to access to ""copy as a path"", you hold shift and right-click the file. I hope this helps."
dUpyC40cF6Q,not having intro sounded so different. It feels that I've missed some part of the video or even lost a complete previous episode.
dUpyC40cF6Q,Hi Alex! Thanks for video. 12 out 10 as usually. I would like to ask you if you could give us permission to download the files? Thanks in advance!
dUpyC40cF6Q,Finally!!!!!!!!!!
dUpyC40cF6Q,finally pandas came to the zoo now slowly import Numpy animal also from numerical statistics city .
dUpyC40cF6Q,no intro?
gs0FNQR0njI,shutil means 'shell utilities' as it allows users perform various file related tasks similar to the commands used in unix shell
gs0FNQR0njI,"I know this video is old, but I wanted to show my approach when I tried it myself:
Whenever I say something like ""{path}"" I mean, replace it with whatever path you want it to have
""{folder_name}"" would be what you wanna call that folder

import os
import shutil

target_directories = {
    ("".png"", "".jpg"") : ""{path} {folder_name}\\"",
    ("".txt"") : ""{path} {folder_name}\\"",
    ("".pdf"") : ""{path} {folder_name}\\""
}

BASIC_PATH = ""{original path, with a dumping folder at the end}""
files = os.listdir(BASIC_PATH)

for file in files:
    file_location, file_type = os.path.splitext(BASIC_PATH + file)
    for file_suffixes, target_location in target_directories.items():
        if not os.path.exists(target_location):
            os.makedirs(target_location)

        if file_type in file_suffixes and os.path.isfile(file_location + file_type):
            shutil.move(file_location + file_type, target_location + file)"
gs0FNQR0njI,"Ranges iterate until the (n-1)th element thus n is not inclusive in the range, let me know if im wrong"
gs0FNQR0njI,"Great videos changed my career, Thanks a lots, just an info in 13:55, its showing ""There are files in this path that were not moved"" because loop is running 7 times and you have three conditions, due to which it is running else for four times."
gs0FNQR0njI,Where can we get sample data?
gs0FNQR0njI,Can you do this project on Mac using Finder or is this Windows only?
gs0FNQR0njI,"This went way over my head. I ended up using AI, and I still don't get it, but it's okay. We move."
gs0FNQR0njI,"Great video!
But I would have a suggestion to make, instead of creating manually folders and checking the file type, it would be much better to teach how to create a more flexible code with other file types.
So a thought about something like this:
for i in names:
    if not os.path.exists(path+i[-3:]+' files'):
        os.makedirs(path+i[-3:]+' files')
    if not os.path.exists(path+i[-3:]+' files/'+i):
        shutil.move(path+i, path+i[-3:]+' files/'+i)
Doing this you can create a folder for any type of files and check if the files are already there.
I think it would be much better teaching towards learning how to approach more complex scenarios"
gs0FNQR0njI,Wow...this was really an interesting one. Thanks Alex ❤
gs0FNQR0njI,❤❤❤
gs0FNQR0njI,"Great tutorial, thank you!"
gs0FNQR0njI,I find this so add to understand 😭

        shutil.move(path + file, path + 'ppt files/' + file)"
gs0FNQR0njI,"This is so awesome.  I feel like a magician! Thanks, Alex!"
gs0FNQR0njI,"Hi Alex! I really appreciate all these videos that you've posted. I'm still getting a bunch of errors with this though, and I'm not able to see on the video where I'm making errors. Is this posted on your github somewhere? I'm sure I'm missing punctuation or something that I'm just not able to see on the video."
gs0FNQR0njI,a fun project would be to read the extensions for each file from file_name and creating the folder(if not exists) and then move the files into the respective(if not exists)
gs0FNQR0njI,I'm just wondering won't it be more dynamic to make the range in the for loop Len(folder_names) ?

Thank you for the tutorial.
One question please what about PDF file?"
gs0FNQR0njI,"This is very nice way to sort all the files in the folder. I modified the program a little, and allowed it to read all files from the folder and generate the folder name based on the file extension. This way we can eliminate the hard code folder names.

I modified the program to extract the file extensions of each file.

- Move files to their respective folders based on their extensions.
- I hope I learn app development so I can create this into a full application for use."
gs0FNQR0njI,"Hey, great video! 

I am kinda new to programming and I would like to ask for help with two questions if anyone sees this:

1: When defining the if statement for the for loop, I tried to add multiple formats to a given folder like:
 if "".jpg"" or .""png"" in file and...( the rest as in the video) but for some reason this made all files and folders copy into the destination directory, which I am not able to understand why? 

2: It worked for me in Jupiter, but I first tried to do it in VS code with an Anaconda virtual environment setup, but for some reason shutil couldn't be accessed. OS worked fine. I have worked with different packages before, so I am not sure why this one doesn't like my virtual environment. 

Thank you for reading all through this and for your help in advance."
gs0FNQR0njI,"Hi Alex, Could you please tell how can I do this on mac - what will be the path ? 
Thank you."
gs0FNQR0njI,This tells me python is such a powerful tool everyone must learn
gs0FNQR0njI,"Excellent, simple easy tutorial, Thanks!"
gs0FNQR0njI,"Instead of getting rid of the \ in lieu of the /, you can add an additional \\ at the the of the path in order to make it an escape character.

Alex, this video was awesome!"
gs0FNQR0njI,"I've been going through your videos. This one comes out of nowhere and was painful to watch. What does this have to do with Data Analysis? I didn't follow your work/instructions, was lost within the first section - actually, was lost from a few videos back and have been confused. This could turn into hours of figuring out what you were doing.... and for what?!?! Moving pics around you could have just dragged into a new folder. Insane... why isn't any of this relevant?"

gs0FNQR0njI,thank you. but i think you forget to add video about how to clean data using python
gs0FNQR0njI,Hi Alex it's not working out is there any other way to do this
gs0FNQR0njI,The PCWizKid mouse cursor is a classic.
gs0FNQR0njI,I did this but I'm using a Mac. couldn't get the path to be inside the folder. no matter what I tried the path was just outside the python tutorials folder🥲

gs0FNQR0njI,"Hey Alex, I do not find live server in visual studio extensions. How should I get it?"
gs0FNQR0njI,"When you had the 'Else' statement and it returned the message 4 times would that have been because of the 3 folders? I think it may have counted those as a ""file"" in the folder"

gs0FNQR0njI,"Hi Alex!

I`ve tried to do something similar based on your video. The task I've set was: I have a lot of files which names have identical beginning in my Downloads and I have tried to move them all to a single folder. 

Here's what I`ve tried to do and it has worked (not from the first try, to tell the truth, but still).

import os, shutil
path = r""C:/Users/idemianenko/Downloads/""
file_name = os.listdir(path)
os.makedirs(path + 'Credit notes')
for file in file_name:
    if 'invoice_print_' in file:
        shutil.move(path + file, path + 'Credit notes/' + file)

That's why your channel is a box of wonders for me! Thank you for your content and wish you lots of luck!"
gs0FNQR0njI,Awesome video.. here Is another mini project video where you can gather all files with a similar name from a folder in python and set them up for analysis:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-IJz34kpo
gs0FNQR0njI,"shutil is called ""shell utilities"" because it allows you to perform various file-related tasks that are similar to the commands that you might use in a Unix shell, such as copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories."
gs0FNQR0njI,Thanks so much for this amazing content. I found this online learning platform called microverse.... Do you know anything about it and would you advise anyone looking into switching careers. thanks
gs0FNQR0njI,"Hey Alex! I know this isn’t exactly related to the video but I have a question. Do you think a company would hire someone as a data analyst, if all they had were mere basics? Simply they didn’t have a degree in the area, perhaps a certification, but they had a driving spirit to learn. Or are most people, even for entry level positions, expecting you to just drop into the seat and go off with little to no extra help?"
gs0FNQR0njI,"Also, I had issues doing the amazon web-scrapping project you posted about a year ago because a lot had changed in the webpage source. I asked for help but I didn't get a response, we understand you're busy (we don't your time for granted or feel entitled to it) but do you plan to do another web scrapping project to include in the Free Boot Camp?"
gs0FNQR0njI,"Damn! Alex is so real. Can we write a program to automatically detect the file formats, create folders and sort them accordingly?  Because I feel it could be difficult to manually detect and name the folders if the list is endless. Sounds like a clustering thing  in machine learning but I'm not sure. Please what do you think?"
gs0FNQR0njI,Do you think this will be good project to put in our portfolio?
C75TROiiEa0,"Alex can you please review Google AI studio, especially screen sharing feature. And also your opinion how it will effect whole courses industry."
C75TROiiEa0,👋
C75TROiiEa0,"impressive, thank you"
C75TROiiEa0,"""There is only one word to describe this: pretty impressive"" (Two words) (Humans...)"
C75TROiiEa0,How would it work for SEO?
C75TROiiEa0,Thanks!
C75TROiiEa0,"I wasn't interrupted by a network error, I was interrupted by a boatload of ads."
C75TROiiEa0,"Anyone can tell me if that would be the best setup to analyze Roulette spins made by a specific table? Also I'm trying to build the perfect prompt to get GPT to tell me the next number (within 6 chips) using that info, like an algorithm would. I've seen a few built that gives the exact number, but they won't share or sell."
C75TROiiEa0,Love this channel
C75TROiiEa0,"You should give the Noteable plugin a try, it can do some pretty amazing things."
C75TROiiEa0,"""I don't want to pay for it. It has all these limitations, though. The paid version almost eliminates these problems. I still don't want to pay for it."""
C75TROiiEa0,You need to do a video explaining WHY this isn't valuable enough to pay for!
C75TROiiEa0,"Thanks for a great video.
How can I analyze big data sets with chatgpt or any other AI engines?"
C75TROiiEa0,Some of us may have to pivot real quick from BA/DA to something more accommodating..
C75TROiiEa0,"I don't really believe in paying...really? 😂 Is this youtube channel free...and you make no money from it? How are the creators of chatgpt supposed to make a living? You should say ""I believe in paying but I don't have the money right now""."
C75TROiiEa0,All examples are for small datasets of a few records. Is it possible to use chat GPT for analysis with a larger dataset of say 500 or 800 records (40 variables); how?
C75TROiiEa0,"You seem to be more excited with the technology than the results. I have been trying to accomplish one real life common, simple, fiduciary problem. I ran hundreds of variations to get the correct answer.. ChatGPT has yet to come close to solving the problem that I can just look at and solve.. 

I would have no problem paying for the product, if it worked."
C75TROiiEa0,"Are you serious when you claim that you are actually using ChatGPT for data analysis, or it’s just to make a catchy title for your video? Clearly ChatGPT cannot possibly directly analyze any meaningful sized dataset. You are purely using it for code generation for dummies…. and misleading others about what ChatGPT can actually do for data analysis today."
C75TROiiEa0,Next Gen Hacking - ChatGPT!  I’m looking!
C75TROiiEa0,"Pretty much aligned with not just how but also why I use gpt. In a relatively short space of time, I replaced what I used to do with SQL and Excel with Python generated with gpt (no prior python or coding experience). Just like you showed in this example, just that in the end, I made Python files and global functions to run what I ran with the first few data sets I explored. Getting this phase of ETL so quickly implemented, brings the more fun and brain taxing part of working with the resulting data up front in no time at all. Which brings me space and time to keep going with gpt to implement more code to do tasks I need done, formulating them dynamically as I go so they can be reused, which leads me to think that a web based browser is on the horizon, to run my functions based on user inputs instead of me via an IDE.
Which of course, one can use gpt for again to try out, build, refactor. In effect, I am building a tool for myself to replace a lot of what I usually find I need to do, just to get me somewhere where the real work of solution building begins, but with a tool box of data exploded from source data. And it seems no sign at all ahead, of what gpt and python can't help me with.
It just today advised that for the next step of my actions (formulating structured data points from unstructured comment fields) that with Python I can utilize X, Y, Z libraries in A, B, C steps to approach my task. What is stunning is that you can ask gpt to do a task for you, like write some sql code - but you can then ask it to give you the python code it used to output the sql code to me, so that I can make a function and not have to come back to gpt again for the same ask.
I don't give gpt any data - just tasks and examples.
It would be fantastic to have a gpt on my local machine, with access to UI commands like I do, through keyboard and mouse referencing - to action these actions, to save files, write files, run queries... I don't really like the idea that any of my true code and data and use case, is sent to OpenAI however - for sure they must have an gpt like model reviewing all user inputs and gpt outputs and clustering on content and use per user interaction with gpt, anything we share is somehow also in their awareness and so customer data, is a no no to use on the platform but also I am concerned how long we will have free access to what we currently have access to. OpenAI know what I use gpt for, whats to say it sees that so many of us are doing similar that they don't pursue the +plus model for coding specific and thats then accessible only through paying... Its a fantastic tool, just the future looks very foggy to me as to where and how this will go."
C75TROiiEa0,"if you tell chat-gpt what version of the programming language you are using it will give you better answers, otherwise it is trying to figure it out through context clues either in your code or from your conversation"
C75TROiiEa0,"For ChatGPT, profit equals revenue?"
C75TROiiEa0,"For people watching this before starting their data analysis journey - NO this will not make much sense. Yes, learning basics of of data analysis, python, SQL, etc. is required to know the jargons/language of how to word your prompts. Alex has provided some certifications in the desription to get started."
C75TROiiEa0,noob question here but if its already possible what about in 3 years ? will data analysts jobs all obscelete ?? thanks !
C75TROiiEa0,"00:02:18 ""I don't really believe in paying"". Huh?"
C75TROiiEa0,Why wouldn't you be willing to pay $20/m for something that can save you huge amounts of time?
C75TROiiEa0,"Awesome video Alex - thanks! When dealing with a much bigger dataset that is too many tokens for a single prompt; how do you propose using GPT to analyse the data? It looks like some people are using GPT in a Jupyter notebook to analyse the full dataset.

I'm not an engineer so do not know exactly how to set this up. Would you consider showing how to do this in a future video?"
C75TROiiEa0,But still recording YT videos?!
C75TROiiEa0,I spent 35 yrs working in big data analytics at one of the credit bureaus - started out on mini computers and moved to the very first pc's so I have literally seen it all. I spent the last 3 months playing with GTP4 on a couple of private big data projects and in conjunction with an ETL tool (like alteryx) I can do in half a day what it took a small team of phd stats 3 months just 15 yrs ago. GPT is extremely impressive in generating code but equally impressive in suggesting methods.  Without doubt GPT and it like are going to radically change data analysis and probably allow the more creative folks to win out over the less creative. It will mean fewer programmers and data engineers for sure. If I were 22 again I would make sure I had the widest possible understanding of  business processes / problems and a wide range of analytical methods at a theoretical level. AI will plug the gap.
C75TROiiEa0,Can you performa ANOVA using chatgpt prompts?
C75TROiiEa0,"You lost me on ""I don't really believe in paying"" 🤯🔫"
C75TROiiEa0,Don't you think AI will kill data analyst  jobs? I am bit concerned 🤔
C75TROiiEa0,"Where your dataset stopped, it is hitting the size limit (it is trying to pass your whole chat  to the gpt api) or on the free one if servers are too busy. Most of the time you can just type continue, and it carry on from where it stopped. when I found that keyword it made my life a lot easier. (on GPT4, not sure if it is available on the paid version yet. I think it is only for approved beta users, it can go up to 32K in size, gtp3.5 turbo can go up to 4k, and i think gpt3 is 2k)"
C75TROiiEa0,What a mooch!!!
C75TROiiEa0,"As a new R programmer, I turned to chat gpt 4, the latest one, to get unstuck several times. I had a very similar experience. I was totally blown away by how quickly it understood my dataset with just one code. But I was equally blown away by it's shortcomings in doing simple things such as it kept giving me the same wrong code over and over even after I told it that the code isn't working and why. It went in a loop. But it always tries to please by apologizing even when I am wrong 😅. It's fun to work with CharGPT but it's important to understand it's limitations. 
One time, it generated a super complicated code for a very simple task, which even as a beginner, I could see. So I was able to get the results with a simple code and went ahead told CharGPT. It's response was like 'its great you found a simpler solutions. please share your code with me so that I can update my system' or something similar. So I ended up teaching my new friend a thing or two 😅. 
With coding, we can always see where the AI is wrong right away as we won't get the results but for general knowledge stuff, it's better to double check from other sources before committing to the info given by CharGPT. It's never said that it doesn't know something or is unsure of something even when it's wrong. Try asking ""why do you make so many silly mistakes?"" for a fun answer (unless it generates less amusing answers for some people😅). Overall it's amazing to work with CharGPT because it actually feels like you are conversing with a human on the other side, a human who can er."
C75TROiiEa0,Lost all respect when you said you really don't want to pay for it... Especially with the amount of processing power you're costing them with your huge requests. SMH.
C75TROiiEa0,"I'm asking this on several channels, brand new to ChatGPT and have been trying to sign up since Monday (this is Wednesday, so 2 days now). I always receive the same error message saying sign-up is not available. Any suggestions?"
C75TROiiEa0,"NETWORK ERROR! Yeah... maybe it's worth the measly $20 for THE best tool ever invented. I just don't understand how this guy and everyone else are saying, ""I don't believe in paying"".... yet you pay $6 for a Starbucks coffee every day!!! Chat GPT is worth 1000x what they're charging. $20? That's IT??? Shut up and TAKE my money! You ""really don't want to"" pay for it? WHY? It's literally worth GOLD having this tool. Don't you get it?"
C75TROiiEa0,I'd love to see a more full analysis example.
C75TROiiEa0,"When the answer stops in the middle, type ""continue"" and press return. If it was not too late, it will continue where it stopped"
C75TROiiEa0,"It does! In fact, I've been working on a project that combines ChatGPT and SQL to make big dataset analysis possible with ChatGPT. We launch on ProductHunt last week."
C75TROiiEa0,"So, is it pointless to get a Bachelors in Data Analytics?"
C75TROiiEa0,"i'll never use any kind of AI in my analysis work, I would rather spend 3 hours trying to solve a problem than be handed the answer in few minutes because thinking and doing the analysis by hand is actually a learning in its own, taking the easy shortcuts is bad"
C75TROiiEa0,"Great video. I'm curious to know though. What do you mean by ""you don't believe in paying""?"
C75TROiiEa0,Only a month old yet sounds like its te h from 1950s lol
C75TROiiEa0,My company is a hater . They banned it
C75TROiiEa0,Hi Alex. Can you work with chat-gpt to find relationship between data to do some predictive analysis?
C75TROiiEa0,"""...i don't really believe in paying."" That's about when i hit ""Subscribe"""
C75TROiiEa0,"While this is useful in a stand alone context, the most benefit will come when it is fully integrated into coding environments and data analysis tools with training optimized for those specific activities.    Right now just using chatgpt in a stand alone context is limited and for full use of this functionality you still need data engineers, programmers and so forth to build applications around it.    One problem, however, is the cloud nature of chatgpt and the fact that they ultimately want you to pay for it, which limits how it can be used in open source projects."
C75TROiiEa0,How do you save the different chats that you have on the left into tabs or folders?
C75TROiiEa0,Awesome
C75TROiiEa0,"Today the way to design is so different. Feeling I am losing my job after coming across this video, which shows how the AI drawing https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8JHjUq9WRRw"
C75TROiiEa0,hard coreinfo
C75TROiiEa0,There's token limitation on ChatGPT. Not suitable for data processing. It will be too expensive.
C75TROiiEa0,It will be interesting to try these in GPT-4 now. 😃
C75TROiiEa0,"I agree with you that it's amazingly impressive. They're not really using code to do this. They're using a massive neural net trained on petabytes of language data, and a bit of feedback on what we humans perceive as helpful or not."
C75TROiiEa0,"Often times when it stops outputting, you can simply type ""Continue"" as your next prompt. The other thing you should know is that it doesn't stop because the server is overloaded, but because you've reached a character limit in the output. For the same reason you cannot do real data analysis with ChatGPG. Try adding a dataset of greater than like 100 rows and 10 columns. It won't work. You can break out the data into pieces and feed it prompt by prompt, but then you run into a data memory retention issue. You shouldn't tell people they can do analysis with ChatGPT unless their dataset is miniscule. It won't work otherwise"
C75TROiiEa0,"ask chat gpt about simple math such as what it is 2+2, and it will say it is 4 as usual. then ask again by saying you heard that it is 5. he will say 
4. but then ask again your wife believes it is 5- then chatgpt will be convinced that it is 5. not 4 and will apologize to you :)"
C75TROiiEa0,Was interesting up to the point you said you didn't believe in paying for it. Lost me there. Bye.
C75TROiiEa0,"You were so polite and valued its work.  I wonder how people growing up now, getting used to ai doing hard work for them even if they are absolutely rude, will affect our society."
C75TROiiEa0,"Well this is unfortunately restricted to 4000 tokens. So, partial content is a mess."
C75TROiiEa0,"I am not new to data analysis, but am new to actually doing it systematically, Should I start elsewhere in the series? I am very familiar with gpt."
C75TROiiEa0,“I don’t really believe in paying” 😂
C75TROiiEa0,"The data set is so tiny it beggars belief.  Deep leaning is rather shallow so far.  Some one-trick-pony show does not convince me.  Those of shallow nature may be thrilled, but it's just a show.  Just one step up from a glorified search engine.  The Turing test has not been breached.  Talk to it for an hour with 50 topics (like we do with each other) then it will fail because its logic wanders.  Sentience and Heuristics are missing."
C75TROiiEa0,Don’t use ai  it’s a lazy thing to do
C75TROiiEa0,RIP Stack Overflow 😂 Oh they must be pissed 🤣
C75TROiiEa0,data analyst people should be worried ?
C75TROiiEa0,Write me a script where I don't use the word but in every other sentence.
C75TROiiEa0,Junior and even mid-level engineers will really benefit from simply being able to paste code and ask why the code was written in a particular way. I've given it some pretty complex SQL code and it explains it correctly.
C75TROiiEa0,"At time 2:18 ""I don't really believe in paying."" I can understand that. But, you must believe in being paid given the join button. I believe in both. At any rate, thanks for the video. Great quality."
C75TROiiEa0,"cool,  I use ChatGPT for Sql code, most time give 100% correct code,"
C75TROiiEa0,Thank you for another interesting and relevant video for data analysis!
C75TROiiEa0,Have you looked into the token use you get with each chat? Once you hit the limit you need to start a fresh chat
C75TROiiEa0,Very interesting
C75TROiiEa0,"(By the way, you can ask “Did you time out?” and it will retry the last answer, often completing it instead of stalling like it did previously.)"
C75TROiiEa0,This is impressive ✌🎖
C75TROiiEa0,Loved the video! Please make more on how to use AI like this. 🤩
C75TROiiEa0,"I believe ChatGPT's operating memory space, today, is 4097 (input+output) tokens, which approximates 3000 words.  This is perhaps why you are seeing truncated outputs, or limited memory of historical input."
C75TROiiEa0,"Guys, to be honest, you should not much rely on GPT3. Here is what it told me: 
ME: Is it possible to get the wrong code from your side?
GPT3: As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to deliberately provide incorrect code. However, it's always possible that there could be mistakes or typos in the code that I provide, so it's a good idea to double-check the code and results to ensure they are correct."
C75TROiiEa0,"Just a tip when chat gpt stops like that you can just tell it to “continue your response from where you left , you stopped mid way “ and he will continue the previous response , pretty cool"
C75TROiiEa0,Your Data Analyst job is at stake!!
C75TROiiEa0,You don't belive in paying for a product your want to be paid to use? And you're a data scientists using the hard work of other data scientists and you want to be paid for your work but them not get paid for theirs?
C75TROiiEa0,Its not the server overloading why its erroring out. It has a max of 4000 tokens (± 3000 words) that's why it stops. Just insert your data before and ask it to continue from where it stopped and it'll finish your code for you
C75TROiiEa0,the way ites generatting sql and python codes...i guess any non coder can become a data scientist
C75TROiiEa0,I don't even think you're an analyst at least not a good one
C75TROiiEa0,"When it gets stuck, you can just ask to ""continue"" and it will continue where it left off."
C75TROiiEa0,"The most interesting thing  I would use AI for is to simulate time lines with the purchasing power of people.  For example, buy a home at varying prices, time lines, and then measuring the quality of life on average following the guidelines.

For example, make a shopping list of everything you ever want to buy in the next  30 years, then ask AI what prices everyone would have to sell those things under which timelines, then perhaps we could redesign economies more efficiently."
C75TROiiEa0,有意義的內容不嫌冗長
C75TROiiEa0,I made a gui that allows me to open a .txt file and convert it to a .csv and you can select your file path to save the new .csv file the possibilities for this are amazing!
C75TROiiEa0,You can ask it to continue when it gives you just a part of a code and it will
C75TROiiEa0,"Thanks for sharing this video on how to use ChatGPT for data analyses. I found it very informative and useful! However, I just wanted to mention that you can save yourself a lot of time and effort by using OpenAI API instead of copying and pasting the data each time into ChatGPT. OpenAI API offers a range of powerful tools and features for data analysis, including language processing, text summarization, and sentiment analysis, which can help you streamline your workflow and improve the accuracy of your results. Just thought I'd share this tip in case you hadn't heard of it before. Thanks again for the great video!"
C75TROiiEa0,"always so inspiring Alex! I've used the explaining, generating, commenting approach myself and funny story, it actually gave me the wrong code once, and when I entered ""can you correct the code because your code is giving me the wrong output for n=90"" it corrected itself and gave me an optimized accurate code, so we def need to be careful on not 'what all we can do through chatgpt' but also 'how' to do it :)"
C75TROiiEa0,"This is amazing Alex; you have perfectly described the scenario. ChatGPT is a complete gamechanger, and i believe that if we use it wisely, we can definitely reap benefits in our existing jobs. They are not here to replace the jobs, but to support us. Keep posting such nice content :)"
C75TROiiEa0,"just type ""continue"" and it will 
19:00"
C75TROiiEa0,"Hi Alex, amazing video, I’ve always been interested in the data science field, and working full time as a data analyst. But I have a few questions about the same. It would mean so much to me if I could have just 10 minutes of your time and discuss those questions. 

And again, thanks for the great content 😊"
C75TROiiEa0,"FYI, if the response from ChatGPT is cut out, its likely because the token for the conversation is run out. You can just prompt with ""continue"" or ""go on"" to continue writing previous response."
C75TROiiEa0,and now tell me that data analysts won't be redundant in 5 years
C75TROiiEa0,👋 Alex is your data analyst bootcamp Playlist enough to getting job for beginners..??😊😊

L-QnW_BZT3c,"Hi, I am from Silver Spring, MD, USA. Thanks! Alex for this free opportunity!"
L-QnW_BZT3c,R always getting shaded😂😭
L-QnW_BZT3c,hi there alex
L-QnW_BZT3c,I live in Canada. about a month ago I finished the certificate and been looking for entry level Data Analyst. I have not seen any entry level data analyst. not even 1. Iam really confused.
L-QnW_BZT3c,"hey Alex, please could you clarify the differences between the IBM data science certification vs IBM data Analyst certification."
L-QnW_BZT3c,Hi Alex
L-QnW_BZT3c,35:00 what if you have a mix of DA and DS projects in your Github?
L-QnW_BZT3c,Thank you so much Alex I really needed this. This was so helpful as I'm getting ready to put together a portfolio and apply for jobs very soon.
L-QnW_BZT3c,"Thank you very much Alex, I've learned a lot about data analysis from your videos."
L-QnW_BZT3c,HI!  alex ... I am from Nigeria
L-QnW_BZT3c,I don't know a more useful and helpful person than you. You are awesome. Thank you. Greetings from Azerbaijan.
L-QnW_BZT3c,Alex God bless you. You keep on inspiring us.
L-QnW_BZT3c,"Hi Alex , I have a question to you ! Most people said that data analyst jobs are not entry level jobs . So if anyone wants to aim to build a career in this profession… without degree is it possible ?"
S76iS03nGis,"Hey alex this us amazing, i was wondering what if these courses are outdated, I'll really appreciate if uh make an update version of this videos....!"
S76iS03nGis,Thanks alex for sharing an amazing knowledge for beginners as a analytics
S76iS03nGis,Can you do an update to this video for 2024. Because that excel pivot tables course is now $200. Would appreciate if you can do a $75 dollar diy curriculum again but for 2024
S76iS03nGis,"I think the best thing about these courses for anyone already in a data analysis role is just learning what everything is called. In job postings and interviews hiring managers like using short hand and buzzwords. Knowing the skills isn't enough, though it should be, you have to be able to convey through buzzwords and acronyms what you can do so hiring managers will pick you. Also, don't underestimate yourselves and your skills. I just had to teach a business analyst with 25 years of experience how to do a vlookup 🤦🏼‍♂️"
S76iS03nGis,"If you are Brazilian and don't speak english, I think the best place for learn Python (better than paid courses) is the Youtube channel from Gustavo Guanabara - Curso em Vídeo."
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, do you think that Kyle Pew's excel class is a good alternative? I am just curious given it is a much longer course."
S76iS03nGis,"This video is one of the most interesting I've seen regarding the topic of learning new skills and which videos will help us with that. It would be nice for you to make a make a video where you will describe your  time table of course taking on the job and after, so we can maybe incorporate some of those habits into our own jobs basically if we are in a similar situation where we can learn on the job, it would be nice to see your schedule so maybe we can include that in our dayjob."
S76iS03nGis,"His list is pretty good as I have taken most of these.  Jose is number 1 for Python.  Colt wasn’t that good as he has trouble staying focused and 100 days of code was the worst course.  If you can’t learn with Jose zero to hero you won’t learn anywhere else.  

Udemy is much better than Coursera which I wasting 4 to 5 months and didn’t learn or retain much.  Udemy got me understanding python and sql within 3 weeks.  By month 2. I was completely comfortable with the basics and some advanced coding"
S76iS03nGis,"I am currently doing the MySQL udemy course and so far seems very indepth.  Although the content is very good, it moves at a pretty rapid pace for learning.  So I am wondering if you did anything to practice what you had learned?  I find that just moving onto the next lesson doesn't solidify what I have learned."
S76iS03nGis,or is it just core courses you ill need to then take the actual course?
S76iS03nGis,Does this curriculum take you all the way through to getting a data analyst certificate where you can then apply for work?
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for your suggestions so much !
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for this video.  Now I have a timeline to follow as I have no idea on where to start.
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, I liked the course selection in udemy, which I am following out by first studying the SQL --> Excel --> Tableau --> Work on your projects --> Will create my portfolio referring your video --> later will start with Python
However, I need one more suggestion, if you can recommend any good udemy course for 'Excel dashboards and data analysis for business advanced level' from tons of resources, as I have spend over a decade using this tool in my career for about 10 years(its a bread and butter for me now)."
S76iS03nGis,Are you able to pull a job with these courses?
S76iS03nGis,Great roadmap just know that the current prices are higher.
S76iS03nGis,Are the excel courses good for beginners?
S76iS03nGis,Soooooo... how do you feel about Treehouse tech degrees...?
S76iS03nGis,Isn't coursera better because you can audit the course and access the content for free?
S76iS03nGis,@Alex The Analyst thank you for recommending the courses. can you also suggest some courses people can take on Linkedln learning?
S76iS03nGis,3:10 you forgot to mention that they give you a complete Excel Bootcamp Data analysis for free at the end 😅 365 careers/data science are the good stuff 🙂🤫
S76iS03nGis,Except python second course all are available in my personal plan which cost me around 15$ per month....i know courses in personal plan are different but most are same can you make a video for courses in personal plan? hope you get sponsored from udemy too for promoting personal plan i like it so far
S76iS03nGis,Jose Portilla's courses have not been updated in at least 3 years.  He even said in one course (I think the Python Visualization course)  that the course is no longer updated. I don't know why they are still selling the courses.
S76iS03nGis,"Just purchased the Tableau A-Z, hope you get your commission."
S76iS03nGis,Hi there! I noticed that The Complete SQL Bootcamp is no longer of your list of recommended SQL courses. Is it not as helpful as the other two?
S76iS03nGis,Most of Udemy courses are not worth the money regardless to the high reviews.
S76iS03nGis,"Piecharts, UNFORTUNATELY  "
S76iS03nGis,Or I can just watch YouTube to learn
S76iS03nGis,"So this video is not about actually for learner who want to be a data analyst instead this video is for sponsor
I also have taken one course which is not updated and also the udemy has no check and balance on courses offered by the creators"
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, I have a very important question regarding data analytics. I hope you have the time to read this and reply me solving the query. Is there any particular board for data analytics. Like for example if you want to become a CA there is a separate board for it. So is there is any particular board for data analytics?"
S76iS03nGis,Thank you Alex! This is a Curriculum I am looking for.
S76iS03nGis,Jose is a good instructor. I took his PostgreSql course
S76iS03nGis,"Thanks a lot for this great guidance, Alex."
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, I'm changing my career so last year I completed the google data analytics in coursera and python with data science online course  with project... But i like do volunteer first can you please kindly suggest what i have to next? And if any volunteer website if you know please kindly share.... Im in canada saw in google ""data for good"" website is that good to do volunteers. Please kindly reply and Thank you so much."
S76iS03nGis,"@AlexTheAnalyst
Hi Alex, do you think chat gpt will take away data analysis jobs, particularly at the entry and intermediate levels? 
I have been earning data analysis for a couple of months and I have been making meteoric progress, and your videos  have been focal to my learning, that is why it is important for me to know your opinion on this."
S76iS03nGis,"I've done both the SQL courses, both the Excel courses, and the Power BI course. They are all 5 really fantastic!"
S76iS03nGis,"Hey Alex, would you say there is a prerequisite  amount of excel knowledge needed to taking the Advanced excel functions course?"
S76iS03nGis,do i need to have payed PowerBI or Tableau subscriptions?
S76iS03nGis,@alextheanalyst   So which one is better Udemy or cousera curriculum?
S76iS03nGis,"You have two videos recommending courses on different platforms (Udemy and Coursera). Which Top ones would you recommend first from either platform for SQL, excel, Visualisation and Python?"
S76iS03nGis,"Just discovered your channel. You seem like a cool knowledgeable person on this topic. So im wondering if you can help me with a question i have. So I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and want to instead go into Data Science industry instead of the traditional Software Developer/ Software Engineer career. So as someone like me who eventually one day wants to work in data science industry, is there an entry level job role that one can apply as a starting point and just get promoted/ level up to a data science in time rather than just trying to apply for a data science position from the get go? I dont mind starting at the bottom and working my way up the ladder. If anyone else have any suggestions i would greatly appreciate it?"
S76iS03nGis,"Alex, do you have financial connections to any of these courses on Udemy that you’re recommending? Thank you"
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex , I have a question to you ! Most people said that data analyst jobs are not entry level jobs . So if anyone wants to aim to build a career in this profession… without degree is it possible ?"
S76iS03nGis,"Thank you, Alex. I just purchased the MySQL from 365careers. So far so good."
S76iS03nGis,Thanks Alex and others for the effort and guidance. That last time one hour plus video was also amazing.
S76iS03nGis,So which one is better Udemy or cousera curriculum?
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, I appreciate you making things simpler for us . Could you please let me know the sequence of the videos to be followed for learning Excel from beginner level to pro including data analysis. There are several videos of yours on it but not understanding where to begin with."
S76iS03nGis,"Maven Analytics’, Dustin Cabral’s Tableau basic and advanced courses are much better than Krill’s courses. Also, Chris Bruehl’s Python courses, specially Pandas and Numpy, is one of the best Python courses on Udemy."
S76iS03nGis,Would you recommend these courses over the Google Data cert? I've been trying to decide if I should go the Udemy route but the career cert has the job board when you finish. Or would completing the Udemy courses be enough to find a job?
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for this information! Just wanted to ask you in your personal opinion, which platform do you think is better for learning Data Analytics? Coursera or Udemy? I mean, if you would have to recommend this path or the one that's covered in the video you uploaded on Coursera courses 2 weeks ago which one would you choose? (If you forget about money) Thanks!!"
S76iS03nGis,"Thanks for what you do Alex, you deserve all of the success in the world for your efforts!!

Jose Portilla has a ""Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass"" course, the first 10-12 hours of which cover NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.  It looks like this is a newer edition of the second Jose Portilla you talk about in this video.  If you have experience with both courses, is there a reason you recommend the one you do over the other one?"
S76iS03nGis,Still waiting for your course! 💪
S76iS03nGis,"You're the MVP, Alex!"
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, love the channel. I was lookiing at the SQL course by Careers 365 yesterday and was really interested untill i started to read the reviews, it seems that they do not monitor this or respond to questions. On the other hand, the other hand, I have taken a number of courses from Maven analitics and have been ery happy with the content and the prompt response to questions."
S76iS03nGis,"Be careful with some of those Python courses. A lot of them haven't been updated in years and the syntax is way out of date. If you are new to Python, you'll probably have a hard time figuring out why your code isn't working if you are trying to follow along with the instructor. Make sure to read recent reviews of all courses you are interested in buying."
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, I do not see the prices you showed for these courses on Udemy. How can I get them at those prices."
S76iS03nGis,Do you prefer Udemy more or Coursera?
S76iS03nGis,How much do you recommend the data analyst course by 365 careers on udemy?
S76iS03nGis,"Thank you for your excellent video; I aspire to become a data analyst and always follow your videos and suggestions. Unfortunately, the courses you suggested are not discounted in Germany, and it is pretty expensive here to take all the recommended courses."
S76iS03nGis,This is exactly what I was looking for when I first started learning data analysis! It will surely be really useful for those starting out and I will recommend it to anyone I know getting into analytics.
S76iS03nGis,sponsered by udemy
S76iS03nGis,IMHO the best sql tutorial ever is Kudvenkats sql tutorial series which available for free on youtube
S76iS03nGis,Thank you for this list. So helpful esp if you don’t face bootcamp money & not sure where to start. Going to wait & see if the courses go on sale again. It’s funny how they’re all $100 now.
S76iS03nGis,"Thank you for putting this together. I love the Udemy courses I've taken, but finding the right course is kind of a nightmare on there. This helped so much"
S76iS03nGis,Don't you need some statistics in order to get a job as a data analyst?
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex!! tahnks for the guidance, Regarding Python course you mentioned in the Video. Can I take the ""Learn python for  Data Analysis and visualization"" without knowing anything in python, do they teach me from scratch..."
S76iS03nGis,"I may have to give Power BI a go because for some reason Tableau simply isn't sticking, even after Kirill's course. I'm chalking it up to self-sabotage and imposter syndrome ...but still."
S76iS03nGis,"Hey Alex, how about R programming language? Didn't see it being mentioned in your sharing."
S76iS03nGis,Udemy has some great courses. I ended up taking the 100 days of python course. The first 14 days are the basics and every day has practice exercises. There are a lot of projects throughout that really challenge you to learn the material. It’s not specific to data analytics but it was very helpful.
S76iS03nGis,"Your the goat Alex

Thanks for sharing what made you successful"
S76iS03nGis,The paid content you producing is crazyyy
S76iS03nGis,When's the bootcamp coming? 👀
S76iS03nGis,coursera is better to me
S76iS03nGis,"Hi Alex, awesome video and thank you  for all the info but I found out that some of this individual courses are about $100 , how do I get it at this low price?
Thank you"
S76iS03nGis,Do something similar with coursera 🙏
S76iS03nGis,"Nice that you curated these, I have found Udemy to be haphazard and sorting the wheat from the chaff is too much of a chore compared to something like coursera."
S76iS03nGis,Let's see if I've done any of these...
S76iS03nGis,First one to see this video
RBEgsEVO3T8,I am currently trying to add my projects but it isn't saving. What can I do?
RBEgsEVO3T8,Can i add this to my resume but the link doesn't seems to be professional?
RBEgsEVO3T8,"""It's kind of a website""

Bro it's literally a website 😅"
RBEgsEVO3T8,What are the alternative to Maven for showcasing the analytics portfolio? Please share the links to such alternatives or name them.
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Yup, I am trying out Maven Analytics"
RBEgsEVO3T8,"What is a recommened website to use to create my portfolio. i am a data analyst with specilaztion in visuals (power bi, tabluea, looker, etc)"
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi, Alex!  Did you ever figure out why your Tableau wasn't connecting in your portfolio?  I am having the same issue and haven't been able to find a solution yet.  Thanks!"
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thank you Alex for always being a solution provider on this space. This video came in at the right time🙏
RBEgsEVO3T8,Is it free?
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi Alex - could you discuss or touch on the stress that goes into a data analytics job? Obviously, there is going to be stress in virtually any field and any role, but would you consider Data Analytics a ""stressful job."" I have a below-average tolerance for stress and was wondering if this field would be something to look into. Thanks so much!"
RBEgsEVO3T8,too busy -- none of the dashboards are useful in a business context nor do they convey anything easily digestible. none of this applicable to a business setting. i wouldn't hire this guy.
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi Alex, love your videos. I am currently seeking a career change and - as an introvert - am wondering if data analytics if right for me.

What would you think about a career in data analytics for introverts and people who prefer to work independently?

Now, I am fine working with people, but I do my best work when working independently and it's where I'm happiest.

Would you consider doing a video on this topic?

Thank you! 🙏"
RBEgsEVO3T8,I have a question. What are the chances that a job and Dan and Alex will be replaced by AI?
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Thank you, Alex. I just signed up.  Checked your page to see what's new and as always I got rewarded."
RBEgsEVO3T8,I just joined the Maven Bootcamp.  Thanks for this breakdown Alex.
RBEgsEVO3T8,"I already built a portfolio with GitHub from your previous video, do you think having this would also be a good idea or have either one is good enough?"
RBEgsEVO3T8,"I might not be the best at internetting, but i just clicked on the link above for Maven and their website is all kinds of jacked up.  All other websites I've visited tonight are normal.  The Maven site is just completely off: the structure is off, there's no organization, the pictures have no scale...i mean, i was looking at someone's eyeball zoomed in like 10000%.  It's unusable right now.  Has anyone else seen this tonight?"
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi Alex!  Not sure if you take suggestions for videos, but I was hoping for advice on getting a data analyst role with no professional experience at all.  Because that's the position I'm in, and on top of that, no degree or relevant work history.  But I do have a portfolio, and have won multiple data challenges. I've been applying for weeks with zero responses.  Not sure where to go from here, so I'm open to any advice, on any aspect. I know it's not exactly the same situation you were in, but hopefully you have some insights you'd be able to share.  Thanks!"
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks for the review Alex!!
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi Alex, Thanks for the review 👍🏼"
RBEgsEVO3T8,I like this review and want to check it out for myself now. I think a better option would be to provide a test out option for a small fee that would allow them to verify that you actually have those skills. Once you pass the badge would be added.
RBEgsEVO3T8,Was desperately waiting for this because I am just going to start with the portfolio after having completed all the projects so i wanted to ask you which one is better github or maven analytics for creating a portfolio so please tell me thanks
RBEgsEVO3T8,Hi Alex. Make a video on Data analyst remote jobs that can be done from anywhere in the world. Plz
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hi Alex,thanks for this update. I just want to know,as a biginner is it OK to specify that you are in data analyse intern on your resume?"
RBEgsEVO3T8,"This is a great review Alex! 

Especially appreciate the feedback you provided, which I will address here: 

1. Noting the additional fields as 'required' is a great suggestion, and just an oversight on our part. We will update it. Thanks for calling it out! 

2. Adding additional skills / certificates that are non-Maven to that skills section is something we've talked about, but didn't make it into this MVP launch. I agree with you, opening that field up would be smart. We're still debating this one internally (what to do, how it should look, how open vs prescriptive, etc), so can't promise quick changes. But expect changes here at some point. 

3. Not sure what happened with your Tableau embed attempt. At first glance, I can't see anything you did wrong. I know this is working for other folks, so need to give it a closer look. It's possible there was a bug when you were trying this (still a very new product!) or maybe I am just missing something. We have this embed guide to help folks through the different embed options: 

https://help.mavenanalytics.io/en/articles/6792558-how-do-i-create-a-great-portfolio-project#h_6ed62fc1b2

Consider this product a work in progress. We love feedback like this, so keep it coming!!"
RBEgsEVO3T8,Its looks good but its kind of using your profile to promote their services which is not so great for a personal portfolio.
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks for the info!
RBEgsEVO3T8,You are best
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Hey Alex love the review, i just noticed something maybe you would like to be improved. sometimes when you talk a bit louder the mic is clipping, one way to deal with this is to set the mic to -6 DB at its loudest when you are recording and then use a compressor later on in post production to make it louder that way its consistent, loud and clear. these are my 2 cents. love ya buddy keep being awesome"
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks Alex!
RBEgsEVO3T8,"Thanks Alex for sharing this , PowerBI Desktop will not work correct , it must be the service ? looks super cool though
 ! Will definitely try it :)!"
RBEgsEVO3T8,Thanks again 💫
gCG07l6Fu-U,i also had issues setting up my sql server it made me down most times
gCG07l6Fu-U,"thanks for sharing your experience 
do you have any tips on filters"
gCG07l6Fu-U,"The best part was hearing dont need to know all the different programs (R, PYTHON, etc) as a beginner. Maybe be aware of them but not an expert. Learning in chinka was also great advice too."
gCG07l6Fu-U,Hi 👋 Alex! I’m interested in the projects you mentioned in healthcare. Will you be able to do a video on how to do a few of these projects?? Thanks!!
gCG07l6Fu-U,ECU cup whaaattt?!
gCG07l6Fu-U,"I know this is going to sound crazy to some people following this conversation. I've never made more than I do right now, working for the county, making $58K. A salary of $65 doesn't sound low it sounds unattainable. I'm so glad I started the Google Certification for Data Analyst, and then I'm doing Business Intelligence too. I already am an Excel power user, dax, powerpivot, power query, power BI, Tableau, SQL... I had no idea that was marketable to other areas. I need to get out of government. 😂"
gCG07l6Fu-U,Hearing about the things you had difficulty with and the ways you weren’t perfect when learning data analytics eased so much of my perfectionist based anxieties - I’ve been kicking my butt trying to learn everything all at once and this chat was a great reminder to myself that I’m doing more than enough and I should keep going and apply even when I’m not ready!
gCG07l6Fu-U,Can anyone summarise the 5 points
gCG07l6Fu-U,Alex is amazing ! Bless !!
gCG07l6Fu-U,I agree 100 % . Learning SQL and Actually using Microsoft SQL server Manager Studio is more challenging. The student will actually encounter real errors and will need to solve the error.
gCG07l6Fu-U,I do number 1 and 2. I also translate into my mother tongue while using the protege effect and it helps me even more.
gCG07l6Fu-U,Alex is spot on. Such a great presentation. These same approaches go for learning everything in tech.... especially building projects. Sometimes we all need to be reminded to break the tutorial trap and get started.
gCG07l6Fu-U,"Thanks for this Alex, one question, you have mentioned about automated system""s checking CVs these days, for that, do you prefer doc version or pdf version?"
gCG07l6Fu-U,"Taking breaks spoke to me on a spiritual level haha. I'm also in the CF Data Analytics course and working on my final project. I spent an hour writing a complex Python function to iterate through a large data frame and then create a new column based on seperate columns from different years in the data frame. I took a break while the function was running (it took close to 20 minutes to finish!) and during my break I realized I could just use a simple .loc method to accomplish the same task much quicker and with much less memory. Definitely a face palm moment, but taking that extra time just to think things through while eating a snack really saved a lot of time and energy for other column changes"
gCG07l6Fu-U,I am interested in data science and data analytics
gCG07l6Fu-U,Otis Paul from Uganda
gCG07l6Fu-U,totally agree with all your points about studying
gCG07l6Fu-U,"We hoped you all enjoyed the live event, huge thanks to Alex for taking part again!"
gCG07l6Fu-U,Greeting from Tanzania
gCG07l6Fu-U,👍
gCG07l6Fu-U,"Adeyoyin from Lagos, Nigeria"
gCG07l6Fu-U,I am from Nigeria!
gCG07l6Fu-U,Currently halfway through the data analytics course through CareerFoundry..love it.
gCG07l6Fu-U,Alex is AMAZING!!! From 🇺🇸
gCG07l6Fu-U,Great insights
gCG07l6Fu-U,Noooo.. I missed the live! I'm glad the video is still up though
gCG07l6Fu-U,"Great insights here!!!
Thank you for the session.
Watching from Nigeria."
gCG07l6Fu-U,Greetings from Poland! 👋
gCG07l6Fu-U,Enjoying the session from Bangladesh. Thank you.
gCG07l6Fu-U,Thanks Alex
gCG07l6Fu-U,I'm from pakistan
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you, sir!"
DXwFsxCtukg,great video! I had a question if you've completed the google data analyst certificate would it be more beneficial to follow this curriculum over the google advanced course?
DXwFsxCtukg,Hey Alex. I love your videos I’m a huge fan. Do I have to take all these courses at the same time?
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks you, you saved my live 😊"
DXwFsxCtukg,Hello! How are you? I am new to data analysis and I wonder if I should start on Google data analytic certificate or data analytic boostcamp. I found one affordable boostcamp on codebasics. Would you mind recommend which one should I take the course on? Thank you
DXwFsxCtukg,"The Macquarie University courses on Excel are brilliant! 😃😃 Also thank you for this path creating, this is super useful!"
DXwFsxCtukg,Good stuff Alex!!!!
DXwFsxCtukg,What do you think of the PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization by the same guy as the Python course :) ?
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you so much for this video. I am navigating what courses I should take after fininshing Google Data Analytics Certification courses. I truly appreciate it that you are willing to share all of your knowledge, skills, tips that you acquired through your journey on YouTube!!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hey Alex, what about courses or specializations that cover modeling such as descriptive modeling, predictive and prescriptive modeling?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hi Alex, what do you think about the instructors from Maven analytics apart from Chris dutton? have you tried their courses ? thanks in advance"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you, Alex. I subscribed to Coursera Plus in Oct 2022 to make my own list of courses to become a Data analyst with a target of 6 months. In my own Data analyst career transition journey I started with SQL for data science (of Cdavis, completed Nov'22), just finished the coursework for my Google Data Analytics Certificate(completed Feb'23), and am currently working on my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics certificate. @alextheanalyst  My question for you is SQL for Data science course does not teach you advanced SQL concepts: Window Functions, query optimizations, CTE, and Reg Expressions so how can I self-teach myself using Coursera's catalog of ""Included with Coursera Plu"" courses? I know these questions will come up in interviews"
DXwFsxCtukg,I see the focus on Excel. Do you have any recs for Google Sheets and Data/Looker Studio?
DXwFsxCtukg,Hi Alex!! I wanted to let you know I landed a job as an analyst using your videos :)
DXwFsxCtukg,"Are you actually job ready after the google certificate or do you have to take another advanced sql,excel,python,tableau type course as well?"
DXwFsxCtukg,Which one is best? This coursera ones or the ones in your udemy video?
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hello Everybody. I don't recommend 'Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization'. I finished 3 first courses of this specialization and, to be honest, it is poorly planned; the second course does not correspond with the first, some topics (such as PARTITION, AND-WHERE inside subquery, etc.) are not discussed at all, and Mode Analytics frequently stops operating due to its 10Mb limit, and creating a notebook there is a pain. In the last course (capstone project), they discuss how to prepare data for analysis using python which wasn't covered in the course, and it wasn't a prerequisite. Moreover, they proposed to use tar.gz file in Databricks environment without explaining how to unpack it there (by the way, there is 1.6Tb json file inside). Finally, I dropped it and cancelled my specialization after completing 3 first courses. Let's have a look at how the UC Devis teaches Tableau. As for SQL, they definitely failed."
DXwFsxCtukg,"Is there an updated discount code for Coursera Plus?  I'm interested in the year subscription, but the discount would be fantastic!  Thanks in advance."
DXwFsxCtukg,"Dear Alex, thanks a lot! Loved the recommendations. Is there a possibility to prolong the Cousera Plus code?  It's 01/02/2023 today and I missed it. :-/"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks so much for your material and insight. It's very helpful
DXwFsxCtukg,Would you recommend the Python 3 programming specialization and the Applied Data Science Specialization both offered by U of M?
DXwFsxCtukg,"If money was no concern, would you recommend Coursera or Udemy if you could only recommend one?

Also, it looks like the structure of the courses you recommend is the same across both platforms. How long does it take to complete all the recommended courses on each platform?"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you so much Alex. This is very helpful.
DXwFsxCtukg,"I am now a certified junior data analyst. I learned a lot from you and Luke, I am grateful to both of you. Really thank you so much for these great tutorial,advice and much more..  And now it's time to sharpen my R and Python skills.🖖🤛"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you for the valuable information Alex!
DXwFsxCtukg,"You have two videos recommending courses on different platforms (Udemy and Coursera). Which Top ones would you recommend first from either platform for SQL, excel, Visualisation and Python?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you Alex for the support you are providing, I have only just begun my quest and am deep in the kaggle courses, but found you there... I think. I am strggling but think I am learning, and dont know where to go next on my journey. I may use coursera and the coupon you have provided but not sure yet, anyways, thanks for this video and all of your content. Super Awesome!"
DXwFsxCtukg,All courses with credly badges?
DXwFsxCtukg,Just signed up. Thank you!
DXwFsxCtukg,"To be job ready, which one is the best to complete in and shorter period..?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"I've completed the Google Certification and was looking for next level courses to strengthen these exact skills, but have stalled determining what courses are best for building on those basics! This road map helps immensely and I will be starting tonight on the SQL ones! I can't stress how helpful this is to me as I venture in to switching careers into that of a Data Analyst! Thank you so much!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks so much! I've got a stack of Coursera courses I'm doing already (currently loving a series on Operations Research! So usefully educational), but I'll definitely be checking out next these ones you're suggesting Alex."
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you so much Alex, this is so valuable video ❤
Sadly the IBM are not include on the Coursera Plus though…. But There are a ton of courses included.
Well worth investment! I just enrolled it at 199$ super save! Thanks Alex ❤❤❤"
DXwFsxCtukg,Can I take these courses using a Mac or so I need a PC?
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you so much for this video I was thinking from where I should start after data analyst course by Google and you come up with this vedio which answered my question ... thanks a lot for helping me and changing our lives to the better
DXwFsxCtukg,nice Alex
DXwFsxCtukg,"How many projects should i have on my portfolio to get an entry level job? I have completed googles data analytics course and have their capstone project on my portfolio, and will start to follow your projects on your channel and add those to my portfolio too"
DXwFsxCtukg,Do you think that with the Google professional certificate would be enough to break into tech?
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hey Alex! Really appreciate that you're putting this much effort on educating all of us, I have a request that can you make a series of a particular case study, guiding us step by step. Thank you."
DXwFsxCtukg,Now  I realice is the same organización.  Thank you
DXwFsxCtukg,is there any difference between the google analytics certification with Coursera vs Skillshop?
DXwFsxCtukg,"Great video, I just finished Google Data Analytics I’m now focusing on projects"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hi Alex

I see a lot of videos regarding data analytics but I miss a video about how to track the projects.
How you document what you are doing and what programs to use.
Is there sort of a blueprint of the tables used ro create the queries and how the queries are connected?

I think you would be the perfect person to talk about this.

Best regards"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks Alex for this video. I just completed the Google Analytics certification and was looking for more courses to learn in-depth. Once again thanks for the guidance.
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks for this improved roadmap. My progress through Google's DA Certification actually all but came to a screeching halt the last half of the year just ended due to medical/mental/job stuff (or that's what I tell myself. It really comes down to I got so tired at work due to radical schedule changes that all I wanted to do when i got home from running the cash register was divert/distract myself) as well as not having any sort of accountability support structure to keep me on task, but this video has helped recharge my goal-seeking batteries. 

I may have asked this before, but do you recommend courses on Statistics/Stastistical Analysis/Reasoning for those of us without a CS/Business background?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"I am just finishing up with the Google Analytics course and needed some direction of where to go next. This came out at the perfect time for me, thanks!!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Perfect timing, thank you."
DXwFsxCtukg,Great vid thanks!!! What math and stats courses would you recommend?
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks a lot for such valuable information. I wonder what courses would you recommend for linear algebra, stats and probability on coursera, those are required skills and no one mentions anything about them. Thanks 😊 🙏"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hi Alex! Once again, thanks a lot for doing these videos. 
I have a question that hopefully you'll see. I'm wondering whether I should start the Data Science bachelors degree, as a person with no college education. Do you think it would be beneficial?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Very informative video. How do you access SQL, Tableau, and Python while taking these courses? Are there web versions available through Coursera for the different courses? Thank you!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Love Alex , I could kiss that shiny bald head! lol your amazing my guy! 100"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you Alex, I am going after all of these courses."
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks for another great video Alex. I noticed you mentioned taking some of these classes multiple times. What motivates you to not only finish the courses but repeat them multiple times? Wouldn't simply practicing the concepts on real-life problems in your job be more interesting and practical and help you learn faster?
DXwFsxCtukg,"My company just implementeed free coursera for all of their emplyees, witha requirement of at least 5% of a course being finished every 2 weeks or you would have to re-enroll, my question is would you recommend taking any of these courses at the same time or one by one?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks Alex for the tips and this path to the Data Analyst job! I'm interested, if I buy Coursera Plus for $200, will I also receive a certificate for each completed course along with a one-year subscription and use of all courses, or are the certificates additionally paid for?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you Alex, just used your link to get the Plus account. :)"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Dude this video is sooooooo needed tbh like helping us structure our own learning curriculum is so awesome 
I will do watch a remix to this video"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hey, Bro can you give us an idea about the Google specialization courses that they offer 
1. Data analytics in finance
2. Data analytics in public sector using R"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hi , what you think of excel to mysql speczilation  on couesera"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank youuu
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hey. By subscribing to coursera plus for a year, will i get unlimited certificates without paying additional fees? Does it allow me for example to earn google data analytics cert in march, ibm cybersecurity in may and so until the end of the year ?"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thank you so much for this! I am currently in the 6th course of the Google Data Analytics certification program and  I felt my SQL skills needed a supplement course. I will definitely try these out!
DXwFsxCtukg,that was awesome Alex! Many thanks.
DXwFsxCtukg,Alex how long  would it take to complete all six courses
DXwFsxCtukg,"Alex, are there any programs that are good from Edx?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Are ALL of these classes you've listed available on coursera plus, or separate pay for some classes?  I am looking on my coursera app and having trouble finding this answer"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks Alex, I was looking for best course to learning python. You solved my problem."
DXwFsxCtukg,How many of these courses can be taken with the Coursera + plan?
DXwFsxCtukg,Hi Alex quick question how long do you think we would get a job after finishing all of the courses in coursera
DXwFsxCtukg,I'm looking to start the Google Cert soon and this video is exactly what I was looking for
DXwFsxCtukg,Hello Alex! This is wonderful. But As you have experience in Data Analytics Please try to create a course for Data Analytics! I will glad to learn from you!
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you so much, Alex!! Literally just finished the Google Certification course over the weekend and was stuck wondering what to do next...this helps a lot! I'm planning on diving into your portfolio series too once I feel more confident in my SQL and Python skills. Thank you so much for all your guidance on data analytics...it's been helping so much! 🙏"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Great Alex,  thank you , tons of help, I didn't know where to start 👊🏻"
DXwFsxCtukg,Recorded on 2 jan and you uploaded it on 11 Jan probably took 9 days to upload 😅
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hey Alex ! First of all, thank you for giving us valuable content. I took the Google data analyst certification, and it was good, it gives you the basic fundamentals of data analytics. Currently, I'm looking forward to a more complete course. ¿ Have you ever heard of Practicum bootcamps for data analysts ?, my colleagues told me that it has a decent curriculum."
DXwFsxCtukg,Would you say udemy courses are just as good as coursera or ?
DXwFsxCtukg,"These are really great classes to consider. Not sure if you mentioned it, but one thing to consider is that not all of the courses are Coursera Plus ones, so they still may charge a fee even as a Coursera Plus member  (but you can always apply to Financial aid!). Happy Analyzing!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you so much for the recommendation. I took Google Data Analytics Cert. while ago, there are so many DA/BA related courses in Coursera, not sure which one I should take next. This is a very good curriculum list!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks Alex! been doing the google data analytics specialization, but looking of something meatier, gonna try that sql course you recommended! Also just go the coursera plus through your link. Excited :)"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks for your tips on Python 🐍
DXwFsxCtukg,Hi Alex!! Is it possible to work as a data analyst remotely from another country other than freelancing?????
DXwFsxCtukg,"Great video, with such a daunting amount of data learning material available, it is hard to choose which courses to take, this video makes it so much easier!"
DXwFsxCtukg,This video is exactly what I was thinking of 💯
DXwFsxCtukg,"Hey,Alex! I just finished the Udemy SQL course but i feel like i have to apply it somehow in order to make it stick,any idea on how to practice SQL,maybe some exercises or anything to help me consolidate my SQL skills?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.” —John Wooden.,.."
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks Alex for providing such valuable information.... Will definitely be doing the courses in the order you recommend
DXwFsxCtukg,"Awesome content as always, Alex!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"I really have the drive for this but unfortunately I don't have the money needed to pay up for this course. I'm so sad right now. I see a lot of comments here really excited that they are making progress. Good luck to u all. I wish I could pay for it, but I just don't have what it takes, unfortunately."
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you for the information! Great content as always. I've been doing ""a lot"" of poking around at what courses to look into following the Google Analytics Specialization to get a more in-depth look at some of those concepts."
DXwFsxCtukg,"This is amazing, thank you so much for the resources!!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thanks for this Alex, this is a very timely post! I am currently going through Google Data Analytics to build on my fundamentals, and I'll just follow this path. Thank you so much!"
DXwFsxCtukg,Thanks a lot Alex you have basically made me an amazing learning map I hope once I finish all these courses I would be able to use all these tools like a pro.
DXwFsxCtukg,"Thank you, Alex, for the video. I do have a question to ask...I took one Python class from IBM on Coursera & I dislike their teaching style. Therefore, I am looking for other Coursera classes as replacements. Here are my questions: 

1. Can this class ""Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python"" by the University of Michigan on Coursera replace the ""IBM Data Visualization"" class in your video? 

2.  Can this class ""Introduction to Data Science in Python"" by the University of Michigan on Coursera serves as a replacement for the ""IBM Data Analysis"" class in your video? This class from the U of Michigan is teaching Pandas - which I assume it's for Data Analysis. 

Thank you very much, Alex.  🙇"
DXwFsxCtukg,"Think you Alex for your knowledge share, but I want to know if it's obligate to take the courses in order you mention them ?"
DXwFsxCtukg,"This is a great resource, thank you. If you had to break down what percentage a typical data analyst might actually use each application, what would you say?  
(50% Excel / 20% SQL / 20% Python or R / 10% Tableau or Power BI)"
DXwFsxCtukg,This is cool ❣️ I got my certificate June 2022 ..now I'm looking for data Analyst role...also saved ur videos it's really helped me lots...thank u for ur time ☺️
DXwFsxCtukg,Unfortunately IBM courses are not included in CourseraPlus.
DXwFsxCtukg,"Fantastic video, exactly what I was going to spend my day today researching, now I don’t have to! Question: do *all* of these courses have a project I can use for my portfolio? I saw that a couple did but I was wondering about the rest. :) Thanks again and have a great one!!!"
DXwFsxCtukg,"This is exactly what I did. I looked at a university's curriculum of their masters degree program for Data Analytics and Data Science, I built my own curriculum."

ey1VNjU0YbM,"Hi Alex! Great course! Learning a lot!  Thanks!
I know this tutorial for beginners, but anyway I'd like to comment that there's a better approach to the if-elif-elif-elif code (commonly known as arrow anti-pattern) in this case.
Having a reference table as the source for the logic allows possible future changes (e.g. if the IBM values change for some reason) WITHOUT having to change the logic of the code, only the data contained in the table would be modified in that case.

Something like this:

ref_table = [ {   0.0 : ""a feather"" },
              {  18.5 : ""underweight"" }, 
              {  24.9 : ""normal weight"" },
              {  29.9 : ""overweight"" },
              {  39.4 : ""obese"" },
              {  39.9 : ""severely obeese"" },
              {  99.9 : ""morbidly obese"" },
              { 999.9 : ""life-threatening obese"" }
            ]

name   = input(""Enter your name: "")
weight = int(input(""Enter your weight in pounds: ""))
height = int(input(""Enter your height in inches: ""))
BMI = (weight * 703) / (height * height)

for pos in range(len(ref_table)):
    if ( BMI >= list(ref_table[pos].keys())[0] and BMI < list(ref_table[pos+1].keys())[0] ):
        print(name +  "", your BMI is "" + str(int(BMI)) + "". You are "" + list(ref_table[pos+1].values())[0])"

ey1VNjU0YbM,"Side note for anyone who entered their height and weight and is panicking, the American Medical Association doesn't recommend using BMI alone to measure fat mass or as an indicator of health.

bVJfQAe-UP4,"Hey Alex

You provide a ton of values for hundreds and thousands of people 👍🏼

I am 39, with 3 kids, make great steady paycheck as a country manager, but been playing around with SQL and I kinda like it.

What is your honest opinion if I were to seriously learn Data Analysis for the next 8-12 months, start taking single freelance jobs, and after getting the hang of it, start my own small data analytics constulting shop? Too late? Too risky?

Have the network in various companies across industries through my career

Really tired of working for  tech startup founders and/or dealing with HR stuff for the past 15 years.

Thanks!"
bVJfQAe-UP4,"Alex, You are such a role model! Thank you for all the efforts you put into building such awesome content.

_2OknmkngkQ,"Hi Alex, I have been following you for a while and it is great to see your account blow up like it has."
_2OknmkngkQ,"I agree with one of your viewers (the Target Data Analyst) in that learning a new domain is the hardest part of changing careers to data analytics. I’m in manufacturing value chain analytics using SAP and I know nothing about manufacturing or value chain whatsoever. I can get the tech part (SAP) of the job quickly because the Internet is full of educational content, but there are not value chain or manufacturing crash courses out there. I’m learning on the job and I feel so behind the curve!"
_2OknmkngkQ,We need to have a poll on how to pronounce Udemy. I pronounce it “u-de-MAY”. I’ve heard it pronounced “u-DE-me” and “U-de-me” as well. Who is right?
_2OknmkngkQ,"Such a good point on companies being super behind on tech. This could honestly be a video all on its own

I've seen some reports that go to people super high up that are still in excel with like pivots and excel charts because that's what people are comfortable with 

And I've made solutions for teams that couldn't figure out how to make a few simple formulas in excel"
_2OknmkngkQ,Thanks for the shoutout Alex !! I just came to get caught up on the live stream wasn't expecting to hear my name haha 😂
_2OknmkngkQ,awesome stream! thanks man
_2OknmkngkQ,"Alex, you are hilarious. I was hoping your wife would be the special guest, but ok..."
_2OknmkngkQ,Alex sounds like Phil Dunphy at the beginning of this vid
_2OknmkngkQ,Thank you for all you do for the community Santalexxx 🎉
_2OknmkngkQ,Hahaaaaaaa
_2OknmkngkQ,"Hi Alex thank you for this teaching and all, please I need you help in navigating ,I have diploma in marketing I don't have a BSC at all but I want to change my life and grow please do I need my BSC at all in order to grow and get a data analyst jobs ? Or should I get my BSC cause I am thinking of enrolling into school"
_2OknmkngkQ,"Hello Alex, thanks for the learnings and I'm happy to share that I've finally made the jump and got my first job related to Data Analytics. However I'm wondering, I landed an L1 Data & Analytics Platform Support Engineer, would this be the same as other entry-level Data Analyst positions you've mentioned? Any suggestions as to how should be my mindset in taking this job? I'm working fully remote for an Egyptian Digital Transformation Company and I'm just ecstatic that I landed this job. Greetings from the Philippines!"
_2OknmkngkQ,"Wish we could do these more than once per month!!  Thanks for all that you do for the community, Santa - I mean, ATA!!"
_2OknmkngkQ,Santa Alex I need a junior data analyst job for this Christmas.
B63bN2cLVLM,"thank you, alex"
B63bN2cLVLM,I really appreciate how you call back to the different data types (calling out how sets are unique values so that our results will be fewer than when we converted to a list)
B63bN2cLVLM,❤❤❤
B63bN2cLVLM,"Thanks Alex, I like how you emphasize on previous learning in your new videos. For some reason my set is just not working I keep getting this error 'TypeError: 'list' object is not callable"""
B63bN2cLVLM,"hey how could you converting string to list without assinging a variable  well i am asking because i tried it but no able to do it 
does anyone know why it happens"
B63bN2cLVLM,Done!
B63bN2cLVLM,"Wow!! I was the 1 thousandth like.
 Keep up the excellent work Alex."
B63bN2cLVLM,I tried using the list conversion method... it is saying that I can't call it 😢
B63bN2cLVLM,"Helpful video--it's easy to get mixed up with this concept. Appreciate your short and clear explanation. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!!"
B63bN2cLVLM,"quick question? 
is this your actual age?"
B63bN2cLVLM,the hair: 'N/A' got me 😂😂
B63bN2cLVLM,"You are 28? I feel old jaja I have seen the entire series, well some python and panda remaining, but i always saw you as a wise master, there for I though I was younger than you jaja i not that mucho of a difference, i am 30, but still xD"
B63bN2cLVLM,"Hi Alex, this no longer works. Getting ""dict object is not callable"" when making keys into list. Any solutions?"
B63bN2cLVLM,Hair: 'N/A' 😂
B63bN2cLVLM,'hair' : 'N/A' #RoastingYourself😂
B63bN2cLVLM,too fast
B63bN2cLVLM,sir is python necessary for a data analyst
B63bN2cLVLM,Do you know when the Pandas course will be uploaded?  TY
B63bN2cLVLM,Thank you very much !
B63bN2cLVLM,"Does anyone know about the ""Masterschool"" Data Analyst program? What was your experience? Thx"
B63bN2cLVLM,When will you have an opening again for - Director of Data Analytics ?
B63bN2cLVLM,"now there are normal data types, and  then there is ""datetime' :-) .   This evil datatype can make an adult cry"
B63bN2cLVLM,"Hi Alex, 
What is your thought about chat gpt? I understand that during your YouTube carrier you got same questions: how or is it worth it to get in IT. But look what is happening now with all this lay offs. 
And now you can use chat gpt that is much smarter than some junior who's still studying. Looks like more lay offs are coming. How to survive in this new reality if I’m a switcher and still studying not even have a job."
B63bN2cLVLM,How I can use data analyst in pharmacist and medical sector .. what kind of programs I should learn.. thanks for ur efforts
B63bN2cLVLM,This came in clutch 🙌
zvzjaqMBEso,Thanks for ur work))
zvzjaqMBEso,This was really good. Better than my textbook 👍
zvzjaqMBEso,"wrong naming convention for functions, when you name- think ""this function will"" and what comes next is your name"
zvzjaqMBEso,You covered a lot in such a small amount of time!
zvzjaqMBEso,❤❤❤
zvzjaqMBEso,"nice but what version of python is this? some of the notation does not work for me, I am learning python 3 as a beginner"
zvzjaqMBEso,"God am so confused😂😂… am sure this is the best explanation I’ll get anywhere on YouTube, so I’ll just keep going and hopefully some day I’ll meet this somewhere else and it makes sense… thank you so much for the work"
zvzjaqMBEso,"Alex! thank you so much, about 3 years ago I bought on line some python courses and never was able to understand the basics of them , and now with this boot camp I  do understand a lot more and finally I am retaking those courses, you really have a talent to explain all this stuff. Thanks"
zvzjaqMBEso,Good to know print() method is where you draw the line for “not super advanced” 😂
zvzjaqMBEso,Thankyou my sir Alex is video is we important and interesting to me . Thanks
zvzjaqMBEso,Hello alex  thanks for your course! and i  have a doubt well this much python is ok or is there anything else to learn to become data analyst!!!
zvzjaqMBEso,Done!
zvzjaqMBEso,You're python tutorials are so easy to understand and informative! I appreciate these videos.. as they are aiding me while I take coding classes in college :)
zvzjaqMBEso,Python coding has absolutely put me off trying to be a data analyst lol. I give up
zvzjaqMBEso,Good but very basic. Don´t you have any more in-depth course on python?
zvzjaqMBEso,Functions and loops always pissed me off but your courses are amazing and I cleared these topics easily. Thanks a lot Alex!
zvzjaqMBEso,This made very little sense. Why would you do any of this? TALK ABOUT ARBITRARY!!! And how is anyone meant to remember this?
zvzjaqMBEso,"What i like about your channels is that you show us if and when you run into errors
Showing that they are normal and we should not feel bad when encountering them"
zvzjaqMBEso,How are arbitrary arguments different to pointers in other languages like C?
zvzjaqMBEso,Hello Alex... Thanks alot for these videos. When do we get a playlist on how to carry out a full data analysis with python
zvzjaqMBEso,"use 'return' instead of 'print'.
'print' inside function returns NoneType"
zvzjaqMBEso,"Awesome!!!Great content indeed. By the way I expected few videos on pandas , numpy, mathplotlib as well..As they  also primarily need for data analysis."
zvzjaqMBEso,"At 6:31, is the function essentially skipping anything other than 5 & 6 from the tuple? I'm assuming number[0] and number[1] is referring to the item that matches that index in the tuple."
zvzjaqMBEso,"Great video Alex, but there`s something I didn`t fully understand. What`s the difference between using *args and **kwargs? In which context would you use one or the other one?  Thanks and keep up the grat work !"
zvzjaqMBEso,Keep up the great knowledge 👍
zvzjaqMBEso,"Thank you for your videos! Hope you will put video of real project and how to use this knowledge in real world <3
p.s. you are cute!"
zvzjaqMBEso,I love this Python series Alex. I was so happy knowing you kick-started it on Twitter. I pray you continue it and dive deeper as to how we can apply it in Software engineering or Data Analysis ♥️
zvzjaqMBEso,"Nice video, Alex! I never even heard of arbitrary functions before. One small nitpick...you might want to put in how to use functions with default parameters too."
zvzjaqMBEso,Thanks sir.... you're a genius 💕
zvzjaqMBEso,"Hello Mr Alex. I was going through your video of two years ago about SQL Basics Tutorial For Beginners. I ran into problems at 5.37 minutes. You said that the red underlines could be removed by pressing CONTROL SHIFT ????? 
I didn’t get the last part. Kindly put me through. Thanks for the video. Great content"
zvzjaqMBEso,"Awesome kudos Sir.
Thanks for your time to impact the new generation of data analyst."
zvzjaqMBEso,I Have just started my data analysis journey
zvzjaqMBEso,"Hi I'M Francis and i really like your videos
i consider you as amentor"
zvzjaqMBEso,"My man Alex putting the ""Funk"" back in Python Functions... 🎶"
ECduJk00mUU,"I don’t know why you keep showing tutorials with numbers as examples. Not everyone is Stephen Hawking. Just tell me that  I can make the user enter a bloody password — otherwise, keep telling them to enter it in a loop if the pass is wrong . Thank you for your efforts."
ECduJk00mUU,Che aura
ECduJk00mUU,"The continue function is hard to comprehend for me, but the way I currently understand it is that it resets to the beginning of our while loop.

So on my machine, I have the following code:

number = 0

while number < 5: 
    number = number +1
    if number == 3:
        continue
        print(number)
else: 
    print('No Longer <5')

and the result is the following:

No Longer <5

My explanation for this result is that our number goes through our while loop as 0, gets +1, isn't 3, then repeats...
1 + 1, isn't 3, so it repeats... 2+1 is 3, so then we get to the 'continue' function, and instead of printing any number, the continue function sends us back up to the beginning of our loop, so 3+1 becomes 4, and then 4+1 is NO LONGER <5, so we've completed the entire while loop statement, and then the else statement is read. So we only see the else statement actually printed."
ECduJk00mUU,"For the while loop where we are using ""continue"", when we hit ""continue"" why did we restart the while loop vs the second example we actually continued to the next line to print it?"
ECduJk00mUU,❤❤❤
ECduJk00mUU,¿‽
ECduJk00mUU,1:56 You can also use number += 1 as that is the same as number = number + 1
ECduJk00mUU,Awesome tutorial 💯 10/10.
ECduJk00mUU,Thank you sir
ECduJk00mUU,Knowledge purpose. Thank You Alex
ECduJk00mUU,Awesome!
ECduJk00mUU,What do I get if I join?
ECduJk00mUU,I didn't know that break and continue had that sort of impact on the else clause written after. Thank you Alex
ECduJk00mUU,Excellent
ECduJk00mUU,1:01 why  is the number = 1 but not any other number?
ECduJk00mUU,nice
ECduJk00mUU,"¿Can we appreciate the fact that alex spent 30 minutes to teach us ""While Loops"" and then we have the short five minute teaching lesson?

Thank you so much for the worka and effort to teach us python!

I'll leave my like (I'm already subscribed ❤)"
ECduJk00mUU,"Well explained, thanks!"
ECduJk00mUU,Really good videos Alex. Would appreciate if you could recommend where to do some exercises.
ECduJk00mUU,Can we not use 'If statement' with For loops in order to recreat while loops?
ECduJk00mUU,Thank you sir!
ECduJk00mUU,"Hey Alex, thanks for your videos. I am a bit confused about  this one though, so when number is 0 and you say number+1, isn't it supposed to start with a 1 directly skipping the 0???"
ECduJk00mUU,Hey Alex thank you for introducing me to this interesting world of data.
ECduJk00mUU,"Hi Alex, thanks the useful contents as always. I also wanted to ask if one of your next tutorial series could be about the finance/economic concepts required for a data analyst job.  It seems an important subject, especially for people like me who come from a different field, but I haven't seen a data analyst channel or an online resource focusing on that aspect."
ECduJk00mUU,Just learned about loops on Mimo but it’s not comprehensive in explaining it. Thanks for this!
ECduJk00mUU,"Hello Alex,
I'm an university student. Currently I'm learning Excel and SQL. I just want to know that can I get a full time/ part time remote Data Analyst job?"
ECduJk00mUU,The first time I learned about while loops I was a bit confused. After practicing with them for a while (hehe) I’m much more comfortable using them.
ECduJk00mUU,"Another great content
Thanks Alex"
ECduJk00mUU,"Awesome, kudos Sir"
ECduJk00mUU,"“for your eyes only “ please make a video about how to prepare presentations ,it will be really helpful guys like me who don’t havd real data analyst work experience"
ECduJk00mUU,"Hello Alex, thank you for the video on while loops. May I ask you that as a Data Analyst, 1. how often do you code? 
2. What language do you use? (I am trying to switch careers/jobs and go back to a community college to learn Python. But, I am just wondering do you code in Java as well? ) 

Thank you!"
zmIdC0_0BgY,hey Alex the concepts you covered of python are more than enough ?
zmIdC0_0BgY,"Whenever I am lost, I know exactly where to come! Thank you Alex - I have really been struggling with understanding loops but the diagram at the beginning of your video and the examples cleared all my doubts!! :)"
zmIdC0_0BgY,Thank you!
zmIdC0_0BgY,"wow how good you explain , Thankyou"
zmIdC0_0BgY,Thank you Alex!
zmIdC0_0BgY,"I really love how you explain what's happening behind the scenes a bit before you run anything, then do a fuller explanation once you've run your code to explain the results."
zmIdC0_0BgY,thanks for making it so clear
zmIdC0_0BgY,"You do a much better job explaining these concepts than any material I have encountered, both in Google Advanced Data Analytics and in the Intro to Python course in my master's."
zmIdC0_0BgY,You're a saint for making this so much clearer than any other videos I've watched to understand for loop 🤣
zmIdC0_0BgY,"Great videos thanks Alex, but now I really feel like ice cream ;-)"
zmIdC0_0BgY,"I actually found this to be quite simple. On that note, let me enjoy myself some Ice cream"
zmIdC0_0BgY,Thanks for your help. I like your videos. I'm wondering what I get if a actually join ....TIA.
zmIdC0_0BgY,"amazing Alex, good job"
zmIdC0_0BgY,"I wonder if it has to do with having a newer version of Jupyter, considering how long ago the video was published. I wrote the exact same code on the first example (integers = [1,2,3,4,5] to follow along, and I got an error message: ""name 'integers' is not defined."" Any help? By the way, thank you for explaining so well! I love watching your videos.

Update: never mind. I defined 'integers' by adding:
 for x in integers: 
print(x)

and it worked. I'm leaving this update here in case another novice like me encounters the same issue. ;-) Alex, your videos have been extremely helpful! Thanks!"
zmIdC0_0BgY,"I have studied for loop over and over without understanding until today. Thank you so much, Alex, this is so helpful."
zmIdC0_0BgY,"With no real experience with Python, as a use case in the Healthcare industry, would  you nest for loop a diagnosis and cpt codes commonly associated with the diagnosis then compare what was in { } or not in { }?   I guess you could then compare what doctors then usually do what procedures on a diagnosis.  BTW, is that something an analyst or scientist be more likely to do! Thanks for breaking this down to the Nub3 level!"
zmIdC0_0BgY,Thanks Alex!
zmIdC0_0BgY,"Fantastic!
Really learned a lot"
zmIdC0_0BgY,"At timestamp 3:19, for code print(Jelly + Jelly), how come we don't write is print( 'Jelly' + Jelly')? Is Jelly not a string?"
zmIdC0_0BgY,"Hi Alex, please what is wrong with this code  it seems to be calculating wrongly.

zmIdC0_0BgY,Perfectooooooooo
zmIdC0_0BgY,Thanks for sharing and glad you chose Jupyter notebook to walk through the for loop tutorial...
zmIdC0_0BgY,"Looking forward to this. I am a Data Analyst and use the basics of Python/Pandas, but have SO much more to learn"
zmIdC0_0BgY,boring. already a billion python beginner tutorials on the internet.
zmIdC0_0BgY,Superb one 👏🏻
zmIdC0_0BgY,Kudos Sir
zmIdC0_0BgY,"hey alex, i just started doing your course the other day and really love it!! i did wanna ask, why did you choose to use jupyter instead of python itself?"
zmIdC0_0BgY,Thank you for this video.
eP8-mo5jRrY,How can I get courses from you?
eP8-mo5jRrY,When is your next live stream Alex
eP8-mo5jRrY,"just wanna reach out and say that your portfolio projects have been a huge help and it helped me land a seasonal position as a data analyst at amazon!!!! Thank you Alex, love the content!!"
eP8-mo5jRrY,"Hi Alex, thank you for sharing all your knowledge and to help individuals to learn and have a career as a Data analyst. I had other commitments that I was not able to attend your live Q&A.  Anyway,  What is your thought about other e-online  who says, we train you and help you find a job, guaranteed. And what if I'm just a freelance and take the course for data analytics in Google. Is Data Analytics an in-demand job for 2022? Thank you."
eP8-mo5jRrY,"I would like to know how completing a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating your skills and knowledge is going to equate to 5 years experience? because no one hires anyone in this field with less than 5 years experience. They only look at senior level candidates for any of these types of positions. I have been 2 years trying to get a paid position and can't even have a conversation with anyone because I don't have enough work experience. Why would anyone go into such a field when there is no opportunity?  I get calls all day long from recruiters and it is the same old thing ""you don't have enough work experience"" or we need this skill or experience in this particular industry etc. It is a waste of time!"
eP8-mo5jRrY,"Hey Alex, I'm from finance educational background I'm taking Google Data analytics program. Is it enough for me to start my career in data analytics? And is there anything would you suggest me to consider as I have just started learning about it. Thank you in advance"
eP8-mo5jRrY,Where can one get employed if they study Data analysis? 🇳🇦
eP8-mo5jRrY,"I had another commitment and couldn't attend the livestream. I wanted to share that I received financial aid to start the Google Data Analytics course and I am loving it! Also wanted to say a big THANKS to you (most especially) and to Luke, Tina, and Ken for the videos and encouragement! Y'all are the best!"
eP8-mo5jRrY,"Hey Alex, huge fan of your work on YouTube as someone who wants to get into data analytics. Not sure if it's just me, but there doesn't seem to be any audio on the YouTube upload."
eP8-mo5jRrY,What camera do you use? It's just OUTSTANDING.
eP8-mo5jRrY,"Amazing human being to ever live. Thanks bruh...
hi from Zimbabwe"
eP8-mo5jRrY,Great information. I wished I could attend it but I had work unfortunately. Thanks for posting it
eP8-mo5jRrY,ISSA JELILI from Nigeria

-BOBedcjySI,"All killer, no filler in this video. Love that you include what functions can use nesting logic as you present the material."
-BOBedcjySI,"It ddnt indent my statement and I just hit tab, is that OK?"
-BOBedcjySI,❤❤❤
-BOBedcjySI,this is amazing! you just taught me the If statement and nest If! you are amazing
-BOBedcjySI,You make it easy to understand
-BOBedcjySI,"Thanks Alex, u really make it easier to understand everything about phyton"
-BOBedcjySI,good job
-BOBedcjySI,"This video really helped be understand this Python function better. I was a little confused about if/elif/else statement before. Thank you for clarifying this concept for me! As always, THANK YOU ALEX!"
-BOBedcjySI,Wow. You're better than advanced Google analytics videos. To the point and without pleasantries
-BOBedcjySI,😁Thank you Alex.
-BOBedcjySI,Thank 🙏🏻you
-BOBedcjySI,Alex pls  add stata software videos to the playlist
-BOBedcjySI,"Hi, Alex. Thanks for sharing your knowledge.
is that all we need in python?

or do we need to learn about  ""Class"" and etc etc?"
-BOBedcjySI,"Thanks a lot for your effort,
I got a question, why do we use the elif statement I mean we can use the if statement all the time like if we wanted to make a multiple if statements and it's gonna run if it's true, hope you get me,
wish you the best"
-BOBedcjySI,How can I use these statements with a Pandas dataframe?
-BOBedcjySI,"Moving ahead 
left one more video and finish your beautiful course"
-BOBedcjySI,"Hello Alex, I am a new subscriber here , I have watch two of your videos on how to change career, I’m interested to be a data analyst, I’m a graduate of another field Adult Education, please I would like you to help me in this my journey of data analyst, what I need to learn from the start, I really do not have any clue of it, please if you don’t mind to tell me step to step of things I need to do 
Thanks."
-BOBedcjySI,"I’m 22 and I’m in Houston. I am a chemical lab tech and a realtor, but I start classes next week to become a data analyst so I can do that And focus on real estate. I am taking the data analytics essentials program offered by The university of Texas Austin Mcombs business school program. ( 3 months)"
-BOBedcjySI,"Make a playlist, please."
-BOBedcjySI,"Short, clear concise, easy to understand for every person who wants to get into programming quickly. I wish more vids like this were on the internet. So many python tuts  series on YT - this is the one to watch!  Honestly, no remarks, here! Well done!!!! Excellent!"
-BOBedcjySI,"Hi sorry for digressing a bit 

I am currently analysing an employees layoff dataset available on kaggle. It has 1574 records and 9 columns, one of the columns name ""Total_laid_off"" (how many employees were laid off from the organisation,datatype: Int), it has 442 records with missing values. what should I do in this case to treat the missing values? should I replace them with median value or shall I drop missing values from the dataset?
I have a similar question for another column name ""percentage of employees laid off"" (percentage of employees fired out of the total workforce). in this case, also shall I replace 552 missing values with the median percentage value?
What could be the best course of action?
I personally thought I should replace the missing values with median values because dropping so many rows would result in a good amount of loss of information."
-BOBedcjySI,"No Sales Pitch at the end?  LOL.  Thank you!  Just getting into Learning Python, this was quite helpful!"
-BOBedcjySI,My class just covered these yesterday!  Great timing Alex. May I suggest a loops video next?
-BOBedcjySI,I just started learning python and I’ve been enjoying these videos.
-BOBedcjySI,Awesome Sir. Your teachings are really good.
lPVke-p4S7s,❤❤❤
lPVke-p4S7s,God bless you Alex
lPVke-p4S7s,Waoooo. Make learning very easy and simple
lPVke-p4S7s,Thaks for the clear explination Alex!
lPVke-p4S7s,saying vanilla is greater than chocolate is crazy
lPVke-p4S7s,"1:51 the only reason ""vanilla"" == ""chocolate"" is false is not because vanilla is not rqual to chocolate but the id that stores the string isnt equal [vanilla has one id] [choco has one different id] only lists has same id regardless of how you change it"
lPVke-p4S7s,"Computer science kicked in for the logical operators, hah!"
lPVke-p4S7s,"I have found your channel as the best for btech or btech student who want to persuade his career as analyst or who not interested or have less understanding of python will get addicted and seriously best channel i have already seen your almost all videos. Please Bring more roadmaps to become data scientist. do I have to learn deep learning neural networks, NLP everything?"
lPVke-p4S7s,"I understand everything that he did, except the last example when he added in wanted_scoops = 8. How did changing the name without assigning the variables still work?"
lPVke-p4S7s,Thank you.
lPVke-p4S7s,This is easier coming from SQL
lPVke-p4S7s,Thanks!
lPVke-p4S7s,"Although I have a CS background, yet your way of delivering info is very simple and easy.
😉😉😉😉"
lPVke-p4S7s,"Hi Dave, I know this is not related to the video but I need a little help if you can see this. 
I enrolled for the Google Analytics Certificate and applied for the financial aid. I got approved for the financial aid about a four days ago and finished the first course yesterday. Today I finished the first week on the second course but I’m not allowed to take the weekly challenge as it says I need to upgrade even though my financial aid got approved. Please do you have any idea why it comes out that way?"
lPVke-p4S7s,Thank you for simplifying this. Especially the boolean operators. Your videos are always resourceful.
lPVke-p4S7s,"Can you go through some day to day tasks you need to complete as a data analyst in some of the tools e.g. python , excel, powerbi"
lPVke-p4S7s,I’m A business analyst  at ING Bank but I will become a data analyst thanks to you on the future. Thanks for the video
ppsCxnNm-JI,"I love ittttt❤


Glad I came across this channel"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"is the pint set supposed to come in ascending order after printing it, because mine isn't?"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"""Squiggly brackets"" as you call them are actually called curly braces, { and }"
ppsCxnNm-JI,easy and straight to the point!
ppsCxnNm-JI,ty
ppsCxnNm-JI,Wow you love ice cream
ppsCxnNm-JI,That's a weird poem
ppsCxnNm-JI,lol. ice cream the vanquisher of diet
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Thanks Alex, this video was very helpful . 👍"
ppsCxnNm-JI,13:32 They are called “Set Barckets”!
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Tons of material covered in this video, it took me about 2 hours to cover the material while following along and adding notes. 

In my first job interview for a decision scientist role one of my interviewers asked me using python to merge 2 datasets, and I blanked. 

Just after listening to your video, I could have explained that if we have the data we're merging together and it's all the same data type, we could just call each data set and use the | character to combine those values and return only the unique ones. 

However, and I think you'll cover this in your PANDAS series, they probably wanted me to explain how to call PANDAS and use the 'merge' function, which I haven't learned how to do it yet, but I will as I progress through your videos."
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Thanks so much Alex, ive come this far, and im sure I'm going to finish this whole boot camp. I started 11 weeks ago and forward i go."
ppsCxnNm-JI,"When I say that Alex the Analyst is my friend, even though we've never met, I truly mean it. I've gained an immense amount of knowledge from his content, and I am genuinely grateful to the Living God for his generosity in sharing his expertise.

The music on his channel is a testament to his cool and unique style, which only adds to his appeal. But it's not just the music—it's his brilliance and willingness to guide us through the complexities of the data analytics world that truly sets him apart.

Thank you, Alex, for being such an incredible resource and mentor. Your efforts are genuinely appreciated!"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"This would also work

print(""This would print just fine \""you can escape these and they'll print\"""")"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"What is this program and why did you not tell us and how to get it at the very start of the video. Not cool, dude"
ppsCxnNm-JI,thank you walter white
ppsCxnNm-JI,very crisp and relevant aspects explained considering beginner level
ppsCxnNm-JI,❤❤❤
ppsCxnNm-JI,Upon this boot camp I can't look away
ppsCxnNm-JI,"im getting an error as ('list' object is not callable) when i run sets, what do i do"
ppsCxnNm-JI,Came here for help because my intro to python college class was deiving me off a cliff. You explained things so much better
ppsCxnNm-JI,Python and JavaScript are not so different at all in terms of data types. Although they made sure to have different names for each of the corresponding data types
ppsCxnNm-JI,Thank you for your help
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Thank you. I’ve been struggling with these topics from the other courses but I completely understand😢
We need whole series of videos upates every day"
ppsCxnNm-JI,you are so talented at teaching!! I thought coding would be boring and complicated but you make it so fun. thank you!
ppsCxnNm-JI,Curly Brackets* 😂
ppsCxnNm-JI,11:15 why is there a true function in the list?
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Great video, thanks!!"
ppsCxnNm-JI,Great Video 
ppsCxnNm-JI,Crystal clear and straight to the point. Thanks sir. I am currently learning to code in order to lift myself out of povery =)
ppsCxnNm-JI,Hii sir this program can't run with paycharm and visulstdio....
ppsCxnNm-JI,super video
ppsCxnNm-JI,Nice
ppsCxnNm-JI,What do you use shortcut to recall the last thing you wrote is saves you so much time ?
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Great Videos Alex. I've learnt a lot from yourself, for which I can't thank you enough!! 🙌

However, there's something in this lesson, that's left me a little puzzled. 

I hope you, or anyone out there, would be kind enough to help out. 


So, when you did the basic 

a[6] - it returned 'W'.

a[2:5] - returned 'llo'

However a[2:6] - returns 
'llo ' (including space)

a[2:7] - returns 'llo W'

So I'm curious as to why the position number of 'W' has changed, from 6 to 7? 

Thanks"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Hey Alex, thank you for the amazing tutorials, could you kindly do AWS Data analysis from the anaconda or can anyone refer to the best online resource for this Urgently, please."
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Please how do you type the symbol to compare sets ""|” in windows keyboard??"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for this course. I have gone through all of the videos from SQL to now Python, have joined your discord and have begun to tinker around on the Analyst builder app. I have a question for you, but let me give some context first. 

I am starting to learn python data types and got through the entire lesson without a hitch until the very last part, delete statements. I am getting an key error traceback that from my research tells me that the key path may not exist. However, I looked at what you ran in Jupyter and what I ran, and they seem to be identical. Here is the error that I am receiving:

KeyError                                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In [70], line 1
------> 1  del dict_cream['weight']
          3  print(dict_cream)

KeyError: 'weight'
--------------------------------

Here is the dictionary I executed:

{'name' : 'Christine Freberg', 'weekly intake' : 10,  'favorite ice creams' : ['MCC', 'Chocolate'], 'weight' : 300
-------------------------------

Here is the delete statement I executed:

del dict_cream['weight']

print(dict_cream)
__________________

Question:  Any clues as to why I am receiving the key error? I have run through it but am unable to figure it out."
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Fantastic video Alex! I love how you organized all this information. It made it SO much easier to grasp compared to other times I've tried to tackle Python. After making it through 44 videos of your coding bootcamp, I can honestly say I've become a total Alex the Analyst groupie. lol Your content is SUPERB and I can just tell you are a genuine, kind, and overall good human. As always, THANK YOU SO MUCH for all that you do! P.S. Many of my mornings start with watching your videos. When my husband enters our living room, he's started saying, ""Good morning Alex."" lol"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"why i am deleting the weight, it says key weight do not exist? but it there"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"This is great. Thanks for clarifying with examples the difference between lists, Tuples,Sets, and dictionaries,  and how to use them. Really grateful for the simple explanation. This will help me a great deal."
ppsCxnNm-JI,Do we have to memorize all these & * / characters do to output
ppsCxnNm-JI,With zero background i understood well thanks a lot
ppsCxnNm-JI,"As always excellent video, Thank you Alex."
ppsCxnNm-JI,great work sir! I have a quesion : Dictionary data type very similar to the Map???
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Not easy to recall much of that. Also, using your ice cream fetish makes the subject matter seem trivial and unimportant and feels like your ridiculing people's choice watching of learning this stuff"
ppsCxnNm-JI,❤❤❤❤❤
ppsCxnNm-JI,Clear and easy-to-follow guide. It would be great if you could share the working script to follow with the video.
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Hi Alex , theses ""{ }"" are called curly braces i think !"
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Hello Alex ,I am learning Phyton because the speed compare what I was using before ,basic like liberty basic and true basic .I did in  basic a program takes 5 # from 1 to 70 and look what combination are over 1million and take with basic 3 hours or more finished .
The question I have to  use data numbers calculate and graph ,plus I like to use in chemistry and physics. Compare basic data was easy ,phyton is confusing to use long data ."
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Thank you so much, Alex!!!! I've been struggling with these topics from the other course but I completely understand it in 20 minutes on this video. I love the way and thoughtful sequences of explanation that make it so easy to understand. Big love from Bangkok, Thailand Bro 🇹🇭🙏🏻❤🙇🏻‍♂"
ppsCxnNm-JI,On mobile is very hard😢😢
ppsCxnNm-JI,Didnt know you could also do Poetry my friend
ppsCxnNm-JI,"I feel like I wanna eat icecream NOW 😂It's my favorite too, you made me so happy watching this and thinking about everything icecream"
ppsCxnNm-JI,ig the beauty of this bootcamp is that he is teaching only that stuff that he mostly uses or used at work as a data analyst keeping in mind that learners are beginners.
ppsCxnNm-JI,Another area that I am conversant with but still learning something
ppsCxnNm-JI,They are called 'Curly braces/brackets' Alex!... not squiggly brackets :)
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Hi Alex; data is not just data! That is what I got from this video. From tuples to dictionaries really challenging. ""No more Netflix"" from now! Maybe just once per month with my grandkids searching for the perfect chip flavour."
ppsCxnNm-JI,"I did all the steps but I get the error ""ice_cream is not defined""."
ppsCxnNm-JI,Another great video
ppsCxnNm-JI,Thank you for the Python playlist. Will you also make a playlist for R or even SAS? It has been helpful so far.
ppsCxnNm-JI,"hopefully, the wife doesn't see that you said she weighed 300 pounds."
ppsCxnNm-JI,Those are called soft brackets. As [ ] are hard brackets
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Hi Alex, your every videos so amazing and lot of things I learned from your videos. I have a question. I want to get my first internship that's why what project should I do?"
ppsCxnNm-JI,We need whole series of video updates every day 😂
ppsCxnNm-JI,Thanks for this comprehensive video!
ppsCxnNm-JI,My first real world project with Python I accidentally pulled in the data as a tuple…I still had to clean the data. It took me hours if not days to troubleshoot and fix that straightforward data type error…this was a great explanatory video. I am saving it for reference.
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Awesome video as always.
Thanks for all you do. Your videos have been really helpful."
ppsCxnNm-JI,Thanks Alex.. easy and digestible
ppsCxnNm-JI,great tutorial
ppsCxnNm-JI,Thanks Alex! Skipping meal just for this! Let's go 🔥
ppsCxnNm-JI,Workout finished... making coffee... listening to Alex singing the song of my people. 🎶
ppsCxnNm-JI,Another great video as always! Thanks
ppsCxnNm-JI,"Awesome, Kudos Sir!"
rVhHGPDzEck,I’m trying to go into business data analyst within my tech company and they offer tuition refund. I was wondering if doing a college business analysis certificate program would be beneficial. What do you think about this program?
rVhHGPDzEck,People should also explore mmm/econometrics (time series forecasting). There's skills shortage and high salaries (relative to skills required).
rVhHGPDzEck,how do I prepare for google data analytics apprenticeship program online challenge.  please  reply
rVhHGPDzEck,Thanks for the videos.
rVhHGPDzEck,"Thank you, Alex. Your videos are really good and helpful for us."
rVhHGPDzEck,Gm
rVhHGPDzEck,So mad I missed this. I have a sql test to take for a high paying job and I am afraid. I am a certified data analyst now. New to this! Watching the replay ! Thanks for the great content!
rVhHGPDzEck,"I LOVE THESE, liked, shared, & subscribed!"
pHOH7UfOhbE,"I sometimes combine Snake case with Camel case, where using only snake case would need too many underscores, so just using camel case when you can combine two words or so and snake case for the rest"
pHOH7UfOhbE,Thank you 😊
pHOH7UfOhbE,I love how you break it out into understandable chunks
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Hey Hi !!!! just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for the Jupyter Notebook tutorial you created. I had been desperately searching for a clear and beginner-friendly explanation, and your video was exactly what I needed. The way you broke things down made everything so easy to understand, and it really boosted my confidence."
pHOH7UfOhbE,You are nice 😊
pHOH7UfOhbE,But
pHOH7UfOhbE,But how can you start with under score in my school they told me that is error 😅
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Pretty straight foward since its just the basics, but you explaned it well."
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Python made simple!!! Thank you Alex, you are Amazing."
pHOH7UfOhbE,"As someone who initially learned programming with C#, I'm not opposed to snake_case. But I'll always be a defender of camelCase."
pHOH7UfOhbE,"thank u alex , my gosh , this video explain way better than my school lecture video , omfg"
pHOH7UfOhbE,❤❤❤
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Really good explanation.  I watched more than 3 videos about this and another topic, but your explanation really met my need. ❤ thank you"
pHOH7UfOhbE,How do I delete an error while working on Jupiter without deleting the command I want to run .
pHOH7UfOhbE,what a great way to explain! Thank you so much!
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Bro, you are great! You really know how to teach and talk!"
pHOH7UfOhbE,"great guy. detailed, broken down. understandable for someone who has never done coding before. i appreciate your simplicity"
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Here’s a breakdown of helpful shortcuts in Jupyter Notebook:

Command Mode (press Esc to activate):
Up Arrow: Move to the previous cell.
Down Arrow: Move to the next cell.
Enter: Enter edit mode (to start typing in a cell).
A: Insert a new cell above the current one.
B: Insert a new cell below the current one.
D D: Delete the current cell (press D twice).
Edit Mode (press Enter in a cell):
Shift + Enter: Run the current cell and move to the next one.
Ctrl + Enter: Run the current cell but stay in it.
Alt + Enter: Run the current cell and insert a new one below.
Switching Between Cells Without the Mouse:
Esc: Enter Command Mode (you can move between cells easily).
Shift + Enter: Execute a cell and automatically move to the next one.
Useful Navigation Tips:
Esc then J or K: Move to the next or previous cell.
Shift + Enter: This is the closest to what you want—run the current cell and move to the next one. If you don't want to execute the cell but still move, you can press Esc, then use the arrow keys."
pHOH7UfOhbE,You are brilliant!
pHOH7UfOhbE,Just a query can i do the same on VS Code ?
pHOH7UfOhbE,Day 1 variables: see you on the last day building a calculator
pHOH7UfOhbE,Gratitude. Thank u so much
pHOH7UfOhbE,just asking do you need to rename it to .ipynb at the end because I renamed mine without the .ipynb and when I open the file it brings me to a text file I didn't see any way to switch it to notebook so my work around with it is naming it .ipynb at the end
pHOH7UfOhbE,"I'm trying to save the one I did so I can upload on github but it's not working, anyone facing similar issues? I need assistance. Thank you"
pHOH7UfOhbE,I never imagined Python could be such a piece of cake hahhh ( i cant believe i juss said that)
pHOH7UfOhbE,Thanks for the lesson. It helped a lot.
pHOH7UfOhbE,"this is really good, i learnt that the introduction of the single quote (') is what determines if a value is a string or not, thank you for this"
pHOH7UfOhbE,Hey what pluggins do you use to you have stuff automatically come up like the parathensis and other things?
pHOH7UfOhbE,Can you just give me a link to your next video. I spend all this time hunting around for what may or may be next and worrying that i have skipped something by accident
pHOH7UfOhbE,im proud of this video kipe going  realy think youuuuu
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Great video--I really appreciated the part about ""best practices for naming variables"" and ""good/bad variable names."" Awesome breakdown of the basics. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!!! I'm soooo excited that I made it through to the Python videos in your Bootcamp series."
pHOH7UfOhbE,Thanks a lot. Very clear.
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Absoultly helpful and thank you so much #AlexTheAnalyst to make python so easy to understand. before i started your lecture on Python, i went to sevral others but... they did'nt made any sence even they claimed as they are professional teacher but the leavel they are teaching at the level to  ""MASTER OF PYTHON"" students.

Thank you so much once again to make it simple for us to get understand python <3"
pHOH7UfOhbE,THE first video to watch and it's the first time to understand pathon; thank you so much
pHOH7UfOhbE,My eye got hurt by this awful white theme 😖😖😖😖😖😖
pHOH7UfOhbE,Thanks Alex this is very helpful.. love from India ❤️
pHOH7UfOhbE,"I'll be honest I landed an analyst role in my company by accident, the company wanted to outsource a data sorting job and I volunteered to do. Now I'm an analyst with no clue of what I'm doing But Alex makes it look quite simply. Just starting out but I am already hopeful due to how straightforward you make it look"
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Very Easy to understand, Thank you."
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Hi Alex, I'm taking some online courses and I always see that in the codes we always assigned methods( or functions) into a variable. Is there a reason for this or is it just best practices in coding? For example, I'm building  a Naive Bayes Model and we assigned the methods( or functions) like this gnb = GaussianNB(). So, to reiterate my question, why do we need to assign it to gnb why can't I just use GaussianNB()?"
pHOH7UfOhbE,"If we do  x = ' Ice Cream is my favorite' + '2'
print(x)         this will work as it recognize 2 as string due to quotation mark."
pHOH7UfOhbE,I've taken several courses on python which were ok. But your booth camp is exceptional. I love the way you gradually build up your topics from zero to hero. I'll recommend this booth camp for beginners and even intermediate learners. There is always something to learn with Alex. Thank you ❤
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Really helpful.
Thanks Sir Alex!!"
pHOH7UfOhbE,these videos are really helpful.
pHOH7UfOhbE,Anyone else having disk space issues with anaconda? How did you resolve this?
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Thank you Alex, your videos and inspiring, simple and so informative. Really helping to take the next steps in my Data, Reports Analyst career."
pHOH7UfOhbE,"It is possible to add strings and integers together by using the str() method which can be helpful in certain cases. For example:
potions = 5
print( 'Your potions: ' + str(potions) )
output - Your potions: 5"
pHOH7UfOhbE,In Python you do not need to declare data types but most other object oriented languages that I know of you do btw. And I don't think any experienced programmers use the pascal case for variable names unless its for like a class or function
pHOH7UfOhbE,Done
pHOH7UfOhbE,"Hi Alex, your videos are easy to follow and you have also taught me how to use Jupyter. I am upgrading and updating my skills to revisit my old data in Excel, and macros written in Visual Basic and Access.  Such historical information is needed now for baselines and recalibration. Thank you for sharing your knowledge."

WUeBzT43JyY,"Hi everyone!! I am unable to downlaod and run the application, any suggestions?"
WUeBzT43JyY,"I installed it now. I know it has been long but for me, jupyter notebook has not installed.  Could it be because i have pycharm installed ? Please help me what should I do?"
WUeBzT43JyY,"I have a problem, my problem is that whenever l try to launch jupyter, it's opening on my vs code 😢"
WUeBzT43JyY,"Hi Alex, thanks so much for the effort and quality of these videos. I have successfully completed MySQL and Tableau. I am now into Python. Still on track...worth it!"
WUeBzT43JyY,"There was an update to Jupyter notebook, so this video does not completely match anymore had to do a bit of finagling to figure it all out. But love your bootcamp! Thank you!"
WUeBzT43JyY,Jupiter is not seeing my downloads folder automatically. What could be amiss? TY!!!
WUeBzT43JyY,Token or password required
WUeBzT43JyY,Dear Alex. I want to ask that can I use your videos in my website in dubbed language form?
WUeBzT43JyY,
WUeBzT43JyY,"1st day learning python, lets see how long this takes"
WUeBzT43JyY,"I have had SO many issues trying to install Anaconda and it's crazy no one else in this comment section has seemed to have any issues :( but I had to install, uninstall, then reinstall it 3 times. After I reinstalled it, and finally got Anaconda Launcher to work (after having to google several times what the issues were) it won't let me open Jupyter notebooks. I've been trying to google answers for this too, but it's very difficult to navigate. I have never in my life had these kinds of issues with a program, and it seems others are having similar issues with the updated version (since 2024) something is incredibly broken"
WUeBzT43JyY,"i want to ask something, how do i change my directory for the landing page? my default is of C: but i want to change it to disk D:"

WUeBzT43JyY,Can we use pycharm
WUeBzT43JyY,"I'm a data manager trying to push into decision science, and my python skills are pretty weak and need to be buffed up for me to transition job families. I hear this series is really good within my data analyst group."
WUeBzT43JyY,"Thank you Alex, second time landing on your videos, i guess i should subscribe now now, am in an online class for analysing data using python but they assume everyone knows how to use the app and already has it. Thank you very much for the great work"
WUeBzT43JyY,You can also do it with CMD and a NotePad
WUeBzT43JyY,💚💚💚💚
WUeBzT43JyY,"Thanks Alex, you made it so simple for a novice like me"

WUeBzT43JyY,"Hi Alex, I am writing this message on 30th October 2024. I had a lot of issues trying to install Anaconda on my laptop. Starting with  finding the downloading page. May be your intro on downloading could be more expanded to include the most updated information. Thanks."
WUeBzT43JyY,"The new version of anaconda is not launching Jupyter , its says a function was not found and suddenly closed"
WUeBzT43JyY,"Hi Alex,

Could please assist on this issue and your assistance would be great for others who has same issue
Hope expecting your assistance on the same"
WUeBzT43JyY,What might be some possible solutions if the Python 3 (ipykemel) option doesn't come up when I press New??
WUeBzT43JyY,Finally learning Python. Lets do this!
WUeBzT43JyY,"If i run a saved File, it gets opened in the Editor. Hiw could i open a saved file in the environment you use -with cells etc.-?"
WUeBzT43JyY,"Dear Alex, I was reffered to you by a colleage and I'm amazed so far."

WUeBzT43JyY,"Dear Alex Hi , I started to learn right now , thanks for all"
WUeBzT43JyY,"Watching this tutorial a year after the video was made, and Jupyter Notebook's interface is quite different now. All of the flow is still there, so this is still super helpful. Just wild how quickly things evolve..."
WUeBzT43JyY,thx !
WUeBzT43JyY,does anybody facing issues accessing python  from Jupyter notebook?
WUeBzT43JyY,"Thank you for your video. I am a beginner and struggled lot to get in this world. With this video, I am getting some clarity. I am a ""zero"" aiming to become a ""hero"" in future."
WUeBzT43JyY,I can't find python 3 😢

WUeBzT43JyY,"Hiya Alex, how's it going? What's the difference b/w this beginner playlist versus the paid course on website?"
WUeBzT43JyY,Thank you  ❤
WUeBzT43JyY,Yours is python 3.9 while mine is 3.11
WUeBzT43JyY,Thanks Alex .. As others have rightfully pointed out.. the video is simplified and gives confidence to the beginner who is trying to catch hold of python !
WUeBzT43JyY,When I click on Anaconda Navigator I don't get that screen showing all the apps that I can click on? Maybe they changed Anaconda???
WUeBzT43JyY,"Hey Alex,
Love your videos by the way. They've helped me tremendously with my first data analysis projects. Quick question: If I already have Python installed on my system, should I remove it before installing Anaconda? I've read mixed reviews as to whether it's recommended or not. I'm just worried about running into errors since I have Python already installed and it is in my PATH variables. But also, would it be best practice anyway to save on storage by uninstalling the original Python before installing Anaconda? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this! I look forward to your response!"
WUeBzT43JyY,"thank you ! I wanted to ask, what is the effect of you checking ""Register anaconda3 as my default Python 3.9""? I'm not sure how this affects the running of other IDEs like Spyder, pycharm, etc for example. What does it mean ""autiomatically detect anaconda as my primary python 3""? thanks"
WUeBzT43JyY,How do I get the additional references. I only have the reference for Jupyter and nothing else
WUeBzT43JyY,"Really helpful guide.
Thank you so much, dear Alex!"
WUeBzT43JyY,"only reasosn I skipped powerBI and came to jupyter are two reasons
1) my uni does provide microsoft access but not after 5pm NL time 
2) I want to use jupyter for my lab analysis with excel [plot data] SQL create data and tableu VISUALISE data"
WUeBzT43JyY,"Off to a bad start, followed all the steps, but tberes no anaconda navigator app on anywhere. WTF"
WUeBzT43JyY,when I see your videos I hope I will be a good data analyst as soon
WUeBzT43JyY,"holy crap this was an easy install, I downloaded once before and thought it was going to be a pain in the ass but apparently not!"
WUeBzT43JyY,"I'm using vscode for jupyter notebook, there's an extension for that. And yepp there are some tutorials for that."
WUeBzT43JyY,sooo helpful
WUeBzT43JyY,downloaded
WUeBzT43JyY,I'm getting error message when i try to lunch jupiter notebook
WUeBzT43JyY,How can I run external Jupyter notebook from online source to my windows??
WUeBzT43JyY,Thanks a lot for the installation guide.
WUeBzT43JyY,jupyter notebook doesnt work for me. it never connects to the kernel. I am not sure why.
WUeBzT43JyY,"im stuck at ""setting up the package cache"""
WUeBzT43JyY,Thank you sir
WUeBzT43JyY,Why do so many Jupyter Notebooks tutorials on YouTube start by installing Anaconda? It's possible to install and run Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab using pip. There is also a means of running virtual environments called venv.
WUeBzT43JyY,When install Anaconda when Jupyter is web-based ?
WUeBzT43JyY,"finally a python for beginners video that actually starts at the very beginning. almost every other video assumes the viewer already has this setup, and just goes right into doing stuff on software i dont even have downloaded yet!"
WUeBzT43JyY,After some time jupyter note book not working
WUeBzT43JyY,Thank You Alex.
WUeBzT43JyY,Good one. If I have pycharm on my laptop what setting should I use for path
WUeBzT43JyY,you deserve everything good in life anytime i am looking for a resource on data analysis you are the man.
WUeBzT43JyY,This is already more helpful than the Google Python Crash Course on Coursera.
WUeBzT43JyY,I can't see python 3
WUeBzT43JyY,"Dear Alex, thank you for this video. I wanted to ask, is there a way I can access my notebook from different devices? How could I link it to my anaconda account so I can open it in different devices?"
WUeBzT43JyY,Is anyone else experiencing an issue where you download anaconda3 but you cant find anaconda navigator when you search for it? Please help!
WUeBzT43JyY,You used old version old video just replaced . Not happy
WUeBzT43JyY,"Thank you, Alex. I really like you channel. I recommend your channel for anyone who wants to be a developer or a Data Analyst."
WUeBzT43JyY,hi alex sir is this enough to crack data analyst job ?
DVs9u15htXU,"Why does this only have 9,000 views? Great interview"
DVs9u15htXU,I think the reason for Tina's YouTube success is that we techie nurds are not used to seeing a pretty girl like Tina speak our language and converse with us.
DVs9u15htXU,"OMG!
This is such a wholesome video and Tina is such  an inspiration

Thanks so much for this Alex"
DVs9u15htXU,This is a great collaboration and awesome to see Tina and Alex in this interview
DVs9u15htXU,ok now i want to learn more about lonely octopus!  Esp for my kids tho - who are struggling young adults
DVs9u15htXU,what a stunning interview and a video is this🤩🤩🤩 I watched with four eyes.🤓🤓🤓🤓
DVs9u15htXU,"Hi Alex. I just wanted to say THANK YOU and to tell you how much I appreciate your content. Your tutorials, portfolio series and interview tips have helped me so much to finally land my dream job as a Business Intelligence Analyst. Thank you!"

DVs9u15htXU,Great interview guys! LearnMedia Squad!
DVs9u15htXU,TINA!!!
DVs9u15htXU,"hi alex, can you do a video on professional data analytics certifications from a major university/college??"
DVs9u15htXU,"I love Tina! Her secret for being successful on YT is herself. She is very charming, and relatable. Her videos are always spot on, even the personal ones! Every time I watch them I feel inspired and confident that I can make this happen (""this"" meaning becoming a data analyst/scientist). Thank you both for your videos <3"
DVs9u15htXU,"Hi Alex. I am a new follower of yourself. In case I have a question, Where and when should I ask you?"
DVs9u15htXU,Awesome collaboration!
DVs9u15htXU,I was expecting you to be on the right Alex
DVs9u15htXU,I watch both Alex and Tina back to back! A collaboration I really wanted to happen! Thank you 😄
zW3qJUeJLWc,It's been my dream since a junior data analyst to be on the Alex the Analyst show! Thanks for having me on my dude!
zW3qJUeJLWc,First time I see an interview where the interviewer and the guest are so true to themselves and not trying to impress anyone. You should collaborate more guys
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Holy cow, the start of this when he talks about realizing what this field was and understanding what is needed is spot on!
It wasn't just me!"
zW3qJUeJLWc,"I love this! He is funny! You guys are great. I appreciate so much both, I am learning a lot thanks to you! 🙏🏽 Best wishes 🇺🇾"
zW3qJUeJLWc,La creme de la creme
zW3qJUeJLWc,"At 12:10, I share the same feeling about data. My initiative to like data was to collect data from my day-to-day while working as a Doordash delivery driver because I want to maximize money, estimates total payout (since Doordash does not allow it) before taking the order, and much more. Great video Alex!"
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Hi, I would like to get into SQL and get a certificate but how likely is it that I can get hired with just an certificate and no experience? What other certificates can I get to help make me more variable? I need a good career that has a future in it. Thank you ."
zW3qJUeJLWc,There is no greater crossover than this!
zW3qJUeJLWc,Awesome video!!
zW3qJUeJLWc,Another interesting thing about Luke is that he drinks more sparkling water than anyone else on the planet. Bubly please sponsor him!
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Since you guys do meet ups now, how's about a ""data-analytics-YouTube-content-creator-world-tour"" with the first stop being in South Africa of course? 😅"
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Luke was clearly thinking: ""If Ken and Alex could do this it must be easy..."""
zW3qJUeJLWc,"I'm in Luke's shoes as far as realizing that my job is a data analyst. (We use R.) I have ZERO previous experience with data analysis or R, so it's been a steep learning curve. I'm learning on the job but I'm also enrolled in the Google Data Analytics course. I really enjoy this and want to learn as much as possible."
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Here in South Africa we love your channels guys🙏🙏🙏....  
Can you please teach us about Probabilistic Matching?"
zW3qJUeJLWc,what was the book he used for food photography?
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Your one previous interview was JD Ariansen, Alex. I got you."
zW3qJUeJLWc,"Okay, this is an epic fanboy moment for me. It's like a nerd version of Batman v Superman. 🤓 🤓 🤓"
m1AkWK_ODLM,Did we just become mortal enemies!?!? 😳
m1AkWK_ODLM,😂😂😂 actually love this
m1AkWK_ODLM,King Alex like sweet
m1AkWK_ODLM,Super amazing watching both of u in one frame as CDAs (comedian) data analysts 😂
m1AkWK_ODLM,Ohhhh you boys. Lol.
m1AkWK_ODLM,Lol we need more data nerd comedy. I was laughing hard during this. Both of my favorite creators in one vide!
m1AkWK_ODLM,"One of the Times In school With My Best Friend, we had a super big fight with each other in autobody shop with punches, tools being thrown and also throwing each other around... It did lead to us having to have in-school suspension together but yet 30 plus years later, we are still best friends."
m1AkWK_ODLM,"Hilarious, keep up the good work :)"
m1AkWK_ODLM,gold
m1AkWK_ODLM,😂😂😂
m1AkWK_ODLM,That weird hand thingy hahahhaha
m1AkWK_ODLM,Lol loved this 👍🏼
m1AkWK_ODLM,This wouldn't have happened if Tina was the boss 🤣
m1AkWK_ODLM,"This just reminds me of team work and communication skills topic of course 2 on Google data analytics course. As humans we need to learn how to communicate and compromise. 

Great video guys!!👍🏼👍🏼"
m1AkWK_ODLM,Please Upload Regular Expression Video on Advanced SQL
m1AkWK_ODLM,You guys are awesome......  what a video
m1AkWK_ODLM,The guy named Alex in the video is like another version of Alex in Alex The Analyst Youtube channels that I often watch lol
m1AkWK_ODLM,😀😀😀 I can't help but laugh!
m1AkWK_ODLM,This was too funny... but sql and powerbi is my favorite lol
m1AkWK_ODLM,"I'm JUST starting out learning about being a data analyst, so i don't know the difference between ELT or BLT, but y'all are hilarious.  If I'm not having this much fun at my job, then I will unsub your channels!!  Thanks for the laughs!"
m1AkWK_ODLM,😂 super
m1AkWK_ODLM,Pretty funny thanks
m1AkWK_ODLM,A crossover we needed !!
m1AkWK_ODLM,"hahaha I love you both, you are the greatest."
m1AkWK_ODLM,Love this! I don't know if I have ever been pro ELT or ETL. Most things always end up EtLT 🤣
m1AkWK_ODLM,"wow wow wow , seems like an avengers team 😂😂"
m1AkWK_ODLM,"Funny and Amazing,
When will the next episode will be?
You should start a series now for data analyst🤣"
m1AkWK_ODLM,great actors 👍🥰
m1AkWK_ODLM,It is awesome! Love these type of content. Question: is it truth that many companies are switching to Power BI?
m1AkWK_ODLM,Luke is making best friends and mortal enemies everywhere he goes. Who’s next?
m1AkWK_ODLM,The collab we all needed
m1AkWK_ODLM,This collab is a little too good lol
m1AkWK_ODLM,"Sooo weird to see Alex favoring Power BI over Tableau.  Welcome to the good side, Alex."
m1AkWK_ODLM,FINALLY!!!!! yes!
m1AkWK_ODLM,It is a shame to see two great guys fall out of friendship for a perfectly good reason. We all know they should have used python + streamlit for the dashboard
m1AkWK_ODLM,So good!
m1AkWK_ODLM,You are so great guys <3 I love to watch your videos. You are the reason why I decided to go for data analysis career
m1AkWK_ODLM,This is incredible! Great work! (Name a more dynamic duo - We'll wait...)
m1AkWK_ODLM,Thank you for this fun video)
m1AkWK_ODLM,"Man two legends in one video wow
Imagine that Alex and Luke teaching us how to deal with the data and build dashboard etc it's like Messi and Cristiano in one team"
m1AkWK_ODLM,This is amazing 😂
m1AkWK_ODLM,And another entry into the Dataverse...
m1AkWK_ODLM,I love these two!!
m1AkWK_ODLM,Haha funny video
m1AkWK_ODLM,ETL vs ELT Process. I love the Bromance! Let's go!!!
m1AkWK_ODLM,Can you tell us why each of you prefers Mac over windows or vice versa for data analysis?
m1AkWK_ODLM,"Nice video, but I will go for Luke’s choice of using Tableau."
m1AkWK_ODLM,These videos you guys produce are so hilarious 😂 😅
m1AkWK_ODLM,Also the reference to @Seattle Data Guy 😂 and Ken Jee
m1AkWK_ODLM,Hahaha this turned out great! I’ll be y’all’s boss any day of the week!
m1AkWK_ODLM,Love the urge to verbalize the awkwardness. Lmao!
m1AkWK_ODLM,The greatest crossover
m1AkWK_ODLM,😅I insist
m1AkWK_ODLM,Awesome Boss
m1AkWK_ODLM,"Hi

I have watched your videos... However, don't know where to actually start as a Data Analyst... The data I try to collect seems like its already analysed.

Please kindly advise where you can."
Pfq-8pGzgg4,"A winestream, if you will."
Pfq-8pGzgg4,Last question was mine
Pfq-8pGzgg4,I am working claims health care sector and i want to improve my analytic skills so I can get a data analyst role
Pfq-8pGzgg4,Sorry I missed it!
Pfq-8pGzgg4,Does anyone have a link to the mentioned discord? Decided to make a career switch and I'm interested in joining the community
Pfq-8pGzgg4,Hey Alex. I'm a self taught Data Analyst and I'm looking for freelancing work rather than work under a boss. Can you start a freelancing series to guide people like us. You have been my clear motivation since I started this journey 2 years back
Pfq-8pGzgg4,"Hello Alex! I sent you an email maybe 3 months ago, but never got a response from you. Do you mind replying please?
Osvaldo."
pixlHHe_lNQ,"I just completed this project today and I like how everything came full circle. Thank you very much Alex for the time and effort you put into making this tutorial.

You did mention a longer project tutorial. Can you kindly share the link pls."
pixlHHe_lNQ,1000000 thanks for your pro way of easing things ..
pixlHHe_lNQ,Just starting out with Power Bi and this was so so easy!! Thank you so much Alex
pixlHHe_lNQ,I completed this on 3rd August 2025🎉
pixlHHe_lNQ,Done 🎉
pixlHHe_lNQ,"Hey Alex  thank you so mush for the bootcamp , it helped me so much . 
Can you tell me when the  full data cleaning and visualization project as you mentioned in this video is coming or will it come in future ?
Love from India."
pixlHHe_lNQ,"hello everyone, please I am having an issue at 14:38, after replacing the plus sign (+) with (225) and i press ok it does not go back to normal like it shows on alex video...please what should i do? thanks"
pixlHHe_lNQ,"92 year old female from india, hahahahaha, bro LMFAO :P watching it from India :P. Anyways nice tutorial, I am a business analyst and its quite good to develop some hot skills specially in analytics, videos were helpful, thanks mate!"
pixlHHe_lNQ,How to download the exact dataset on gifthub please
pixlHHe_lNQ,"hi, im working on a mac and theres no desktop version of powerbi for mac. any idea how i can overcome this? beuace the web version looks different and as a beginner it makes things much more confusing"
pixlHHe_lNQ,"Thank you Alex. I am pivoting out of Engineering and into data analytics with an MBA. My first gig is in sales and requires data visualization in Power BI. This series and project has been immensely helpful
At or around 41:20 you mentioned going into a deeper two hour guided project using this same data set. Did that ever come out? I cant find it. Love to jump into that. Many thanks"
pixlHHe_lNQ,"Thank you Alex, I'm new to this and I just completed the whole Playlist and the project.
 
At 14:25 there's a bug with the New PowerBi that does not allow the UNFILTER to work like yours, so all I did was revert back, then ""Find & Replace"" without filtering. 

This was so great a tutorial that I now know where to continue my learning using PowerBI. Also I would like to add that during the transformation step, after getting the average salary, we could make the format a ""currency"" so the $ symbol can appear(beside the values) on the table, and on the dashboard which I think you know , but just skipped your mind. 

Thank you all the same. 
Grateful for this."
pixlHHe_lNQ,My power query is returning with 126 errors. Anyone willing to help?
pixlHHe_lNQ,🤲🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏😊💐

pixlHHe_lNQ,"For the Q1 column about roles, I suggest splitting using the comma to form a new column, it will separate ""Other (Please Specify)"" from the role after the colon, this isolated the roles without having to oversimplify the data into other, this would give more accurate insights into the data."

pixlHHe_lNQ,Just completed powerBI with this project was very useful
pixlHHe_lNQ,"Thank you so much for PBI Series. Very useful. 
For the persons who are getting an error on the field Date Taken, I solved it as following:
1. Select the entire column
2. On the Data tab of the ribbon, click Text to Columns.
3. Select Delimited, then click Next > twice.

It should be multiplied by 1000 to represent the actual amount. For example, if the current value is '10,' it should be updated to '10000' to accurately reflect the intended scale."""

pixlHHe_lNQ,"Hey there Alex, you mentioned a couple times in this course that you would be releasing a follow up video that is 2 - 3 hours that is for the next level beyond beginner. I have not been able to find it on your channel -- did this ever get released?"

Make a Particular video on Basic Science and Engineering sir !
Thankyou ❤"
pixlHHe_lNQ,This whole series was beneficial. Can you also guide a thought process on how to look at the data before actually starting to make visualization/transforming it? Like what things to look out for.
pixlHHe_lNQ,"@Alex_The_Analyst 
Hi Alex, When I'm uploading the excel file 'Final Project' into power bi, date taken has been showing in red color and some dots. It's fully not loading the data in power bi. Could you please let me know why?"

3NV5Jtbhfcw,"Argument in favor of pie/donut charts: They are good for demonstrating the relationship of a category to the total. Bar charts are good for ""My top seller is about double the next highest"" but a pie chart is better for ""My top seller is about 1/3 of all sales). You might argue that that's what stacked bar charts are for, but those aren't very engaging if you only have a single bar."

3NV5Jtbhfcw,thankyou Alex <3
3NV5Jtbhfcw,"Currently a statistics undergrad. Did only two weeks of work (SQL, Excel, PowerBI) and already getting interviews for business analytics.

Edit: Found out that you have to change it from ""Count of"" to ""Sum of"" by right clicking and selecting."

3NV5Jtbhfcw,"REALLY enjoyed this video! Excellent content. I particularly enjoyed learning about the line and clustered column chart. I can see using it a lot in the future. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!! You're awesome!"
3NV5Jtbhfcw,"@AlexTheAnalyst Myself and a couple other participants were having trouble with the ""Total Purchased"" populating as ""Sum of Total Purchased"" and it is providing a different value. I noticed that when you click on the visualization for the card, Power BI automatically applied a filter ""DE"" to the output and when remove ""filters affecting this visual"" it corrects the error. You can then rename ""Sum of Total Purchased"" to match the demonstration in the video."
3NV5Jtbhfcw,Thank you Alex!
3NV5Jtbhfcw,The faint minecrafrt villager noise at 7:37 surprised me lol
3NV5Jtbhfcw,So great to better understand how al the pieces are slowly coming together. I'm a very visual person so I look forward to creating my own visualizations like this when I start my projects.

Thank you for the course tho :)"
3NV5Jtbhfcw,Great content so far. loving it
3NV5Jtbhfcw,"Hello! Thank you for the video. Could you please tell me how you remove ""Sum"" part from ""Sum of Total Purchase""?"
3NV5Jtbhfcw,"@AlexTheAnalyst it was very helpful for me to learn power bi as a beginner with precise and informative easily understandable compared to others as they were just showing up the visualization parts., Big thanks to you"

3NV5Jtbhfcw,"Hii sir, I want to switch my career to Data Analyst. So will I get a job after completing the IBM Data Analyst course on Coursera?"
3NV5Jtbhfcw,Hey Alex. I'm working on transitioning from a 3 yrs experienced developer to data analyst. But I'm constantly being rejected on the basis of my linkedin profile. How can I showcase my data analysis projects as 2 or more years of  professional experience? Can you show us how to include self learning projects as professional experience or make recruiters believe that I do have required knowledge
3NV5Jtbhfcw,I was thinking for starting step into power BI.. and here is the correct path . Thanks alot
3NV5Jtbhfcw,I like the honesty in your videos
3NV5Jtbhfcw,"Hi Alex, great video. Question around 5:40, when adding units sold to the y-axis, mine makes it sum of units sold and throws off the graph. How do I change this to only display units sold on y-axis and not sum of units sold. Thanks!"
3NV5Jtbhfcw,"One thing that really scares me about the field is that I feel like I need to practice more excel skills among other things like SQL, Tableau, power BI, but I didn't see to find where. I am doing the Google course, and I am coming from a totally different field (veterinary medicine), so I need more practice but no clue how to do that. Any websites, side courses that I can look for to help me with that. I learn better practicing than just reading.
Thank you. Your videos are very good and I enjoy them :)"

1cfrQLoJMPI,"Hello Alex , which laptop do u recommend to buy for data analysis , MacBook Air m3 or surface laptop 7 ??"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Any SQL data analyst projects as one you had on channel? Thanx
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thank you for posting this! (Even though I'm a year late! lol). I've been looking for something like this to get into the mode of doing projects.
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Wouldn't the recruiter consider it cheating if all my projects stem from guided projects ^^ ?
I would think I need to have projects I did with zero help as well no ?"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thanks Alex, for sharing the guided-projects!"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Amazing and certainly valuable content Alex. Thank you so much!
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thank you
1cfrQLoJMPI,It's really helpful no doubt but is it a good idea to do a guided project with step by step instructions?
1cfrQLoJMPI,"I signed up with the coursera special in Jan 2023 due to the information provided on your channel so this will another excellent resource for my learning journey, thank you"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Hi Alex. Is there any expiry date to the Google Data Analyst Certification? I ask because I heard most of the IT courses have a validity date of 1 - 2 years.
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thank you!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thank you so much Alex. I have one question. As I am gathering my portfolio with projects now, trying to display versatility with different types of projects, do you think it matters what projects you are displaying in your portfolio based on the industry you are applying to? For example. I have a covid based project, do you think applying to sports jobs would be relevant to show? I know having sports projects would be ideal but as you know, we can’t spend our entire time developing projects for every industry. 

Keep up the great work!"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Perfect timing and great information. I had no idea this was thing in Coursera. Thank you!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Hi Alex, your channel and content is top notch, thank you so much for all the valuable information you provide :)"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Hi Alex! Since you asked - I liked your other videos better. The lamp on the top right is distracting, the shelf on the left is not framing a video well either. The little microphone you had in older videos seemed really cool. Just my two cents! :)"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts on these guided projects.

I have been subscribed to Coursera Plus since May. I really like most of their guided projects.

When I saw this video 4 hours ago, I immediately did the Power BI for HR Analytics. After finishing it, I also did the 'Income Statement / Balance Sheet' with that same instructor. That 2nd course also includes 2 optional dashboard projects.

So in a little less than 2 hours, I created not 2, but 4 PBI dashboards and have also downloaded his data sets.

I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who wants to further build their portfolio ( like yours truly). :)

** The instructor for these PBI projects also encourages the student to log in their emails using their cloud desktop so that you can submit those exact projects to potential employers/ clients."
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Hi Alex, do you still have $100 coupon for couresa? The link was expired when clicked it. Thanks!"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"I just began the transition into Data and I’m super excited, your content has been very insightful"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"You ROCK!!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH! I am on my analytics 8 class course working on the Capstone project right now... and while I feel like I have gotten a fairly intermediate exposure to multiple platforms I am at a loss getting started with this. I cannot ""see"" the clear picture of what I am supposed to be doing. But I think that if I do this first it will give me a ton of ""insight"" into how this process should work. I do realize that everyone is different and their processes will not always follow the same reasoning.. and also that this is a way for others to get a glimpse into your way of thinking (process per se) but I think this will be SO HELPFUL!!! so again... THANK YOUUUUU!!! ❤❤"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Hi Alex, do u know of any  free guided project on coursera using excel or google sheets?"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thanks a lot a Alex for this great content...
1cfrQLoJMPI,Does someone need coding for Power BI? My organization uses Power BI. I would like to learn it.
1cfrQLoJMPI,"I want to ask you for advice, I am a web developer worked on many project in my github account, so Should I use new account to upload my data projects or use the same account?"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Alex, All the Guided portfolio projects don't have financial aid attached to them on Coursera. Should I finish a certification before getting one for these?"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Question: I am really interested in changing careers to being a data analyst. However, I do not have a Bachelor's Degree. My degree (A.S.) is in Hospitality Management. I'm 46-years-old. I am currently taking the Google Data Analytics Certificate course on Coursera and will be starting on the IBM Certificate soon. Besides the ""steps"" that you have already stated in other videos (SQL, Python, portfolio, etc.) where should my focus be? Should I be trying to get a Bachelor's in Data Analytics? Time is limited, but my focus and determination is not. What would you recommend?"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Love you my man!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Great suggestion Alex, however, so many of the data analyst relevant ones are not included in Coursera Plus."
1cfrQLoJMPI,Helpful
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thanks been looking for a project to start as a beginner
1cfrQLoJMPI,Broooo i was just thinking about projects how to do them and where to start on my own. It was a little confusing for me..but u just uploaded the right video at the right time..Love you bro 🤘
1cfrQLoJMPI,amazing! thanks for sharing!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"""Sponsored by Coursera"".........Alex sold out..."
1cfrQLoJMPI,This is great! Does Udemy have similar offerings?
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Just want to say, again, what a great resource YOU are! I started browsing the projects on Coursera immediately and found a FREE one that allowed me to test and refresh my Excel skills. BTW, your sound and lighting is great!"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thanks Alex, this is great info."
1cfrQLoJMPI,Thank you! Your videos are so helpful and encouraging!
1cfrQLoJMPI,Alex I have a fairly easy question. Not sure if it was asked. But is there a limit to how many projects you should have on your portfolio? I ask because I want to also show my Network and Server projects as well.
1cfrQLoJMPI,"I pay for a monthly sub to Coursera, but they wanted payment for the Tableau guided project anyway. Is Coursera+ an additional charge?"
1cfrQLoJMPI,I really appreciate all the content you post on this subject it has been instrumental in me seeking a possible career change. I was wondering if you or anyone could provide any insight as to how attenable is it to get a job read in 3 or so months. A quick background about me I am a medical school grad but didn't complete residency to work as an MD. So I took the IT support course on Coursea and really enjoyed it and have been learning python for maybe 3 weeks now and I would like to jump into the tech world to find a job. And before I decide what steps to follow next I do want honest feedback as to what are the chances of someone with my background to actually make it into this industry. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
1cfrQLoJMPI,super cool & helpful!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Thanks for the suggestions, Alex! Are there any Guided Portfolio projects you recommend for those working through the Google Data Analytics Certification? I know you have a few on your channel, but are there any you recommend from Coursera. I see the few you mentioned here use Python (whereas the Google DA program uses R), so if there's any that use R do let me know. As for Python, I want to learn that as well after completing the Google DA program. Is there a Coursera course you recommend? Sorry for the long winded comment and questions. 😂"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Video and sound are both crisp Alex 👌🏾 Not gonna lie, missing the snake plant in the background ☹️ Please ask your wife the name of the plant on the shelf - looks like a type of lilly (?) but I can’t tell. And yes, I also paid attention to your words in the foreground 😜😅"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Awesome content Alex. Thank you so much for sharing this!! :)
1cfrQLoJMPI,"I'm about to finish data analytics, they are teaching us R instead of python and the projects with python 🤔"
1cfrQLoJMPI,If you're wanting to improve your channel @alex try not beginning the content at 1:45... No one wants 90+ seconds of ado. No ado is best.
1cfrQLoJMPI,This is a timely video. Currently starting the process of choosing a case study on coursera and this video provides such useful content - excellent.
1cfrQLoJMPI,Awesome content and quality Alex! You're really outdoing yourself with these videos. Your channel is part of the reason I'm making my career switch to Data. :)
1cfrQLoJMPI,You inspired me to start my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate... I am glad I found your channel!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"The KPI one only includes up to 2021 data so the lesson is a little outdated and some calculations won't work the same way as she is showing, so watch out for that everyone! Maybe follow along with her first to get an idea but make your own hybrid project."
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Holy moly Alex, the quality just sky rocketed on your vids. Audio is crisp, and video looks astounding. BTW, currently on the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I went my own route with a dataset i chose, and i gotta tell ya, its hard but feels rewarding since its noth another cyclistic or bellabeat project.. Hoping to finish soon."
1cfrQLoJMPI,Can you recommend more projects that involve KPI's? I see a lot of job listings in my area where they require experience in working with them and I hope that these projects might help with some hands on experience.
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Alex, I have a question. I am just starting this out, so I would like to know how these projects help us build our portfolio since we basically watch a tutorial and do the same thing (with slight variations)? Shouldn't a portfolio project consist of our original work? Thanks!"
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Your video are very helpful..
I was referring Your video for data cleaning using SQL and it was really helpful."
1cfrQLoJMPI,What’s a project?
1cfrQLoJMPI,So tired of covid data.
1cfrQLoJMPI,Sharing on LinkedIn!
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Great Video! I only took the Google Data Analytics Certificate, so my skills are limited for this project since I don't know Python, Panda, or Spark. But will check on that. Thank you Alex"
1cfrQLoJMPI,Great video. 🤗
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Nice, but quite expensive for a single purchase. Definitely worth it if you already have a subscription."
1cfrQLoJMPI,Nice stuff
1cfrQLoJMPI,Fantastic video! I’m so keen to get into these :)
1cfrQLoJMPI,"Great video, normally when your doing a certification on coursera they recommend a hands on guided project similar to the certification your doing. They gave me a free guided project to complete recently, it was awesome."
1cfrQLoJMPI,This is so handy! thank you Alex! I loved the vibrant lighting. 👍
9j_EBt3RNrs,thank you sooo <3
9j_EBt3RNrs,Nice one Alex
9j_EBt3RNrs,Example was so funny 
9j_EBt3RNrs,❤❤❤
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Dear Alex, Fantastic video!! May God bless you ❤"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Fantastic video, I'm definitely going to use bins!"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"How to do custom bins? like 10,20,50,100 for example"
9j_EBt3RNrs,when i select new group the pop up box has 'field' greyed out and also doesn't select more than 1 values in a group. Can anyone help?
9j_EBt3RNrs,i think bins and lists are similar to partition by expression in sql: grouping by rows without declining the number of rows.
9j_EBt3RNrs,Amazing
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Thanks Alex, you really made this easier to understand"
9j_EBt3RNrs,I am unable to group two ungroup values in one go. Can anybody help me with that?
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Hi Alex , Thank you so much for making these videos. The best part is you not only tell us the technical part but tell us why and where we can use it. It's easy to relate and also understand and learn things this way. Thanks again. Please keep giving this kind of knowledge. Lots of people out there are just giving technical info."
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Very helpful, thank you Alex!"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"i can't select my values when making the lists, how do i resolve that?"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Hey Alex! When I try the visualization, I choose Buyer ID as the field for my Y-Axis but it comes up as ""Count of Buyer ID"". I click on the arrow where I can sometimes choose ""no calculation"" but for this, I don't get the option. It only allows me to choose a calculate field. Can you help me figure this out?"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Awesome video Alex! As always, THANK YOU!"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"my buyer id column is in count, even after i change to dont summarize, its still same, so i dont get the same result as u did here."
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Very easy to understand, Thank you Alex."
9j_EBt3RNrs,"You wrote Alex the analyst ""Apocolype"" which is a typo"
9j_EBt3RNrs,My “buyer ID” is showing as “count of buyer ID”
9j_EBt3RNrs,One feedback that I have is it would be nice if a single common dataset was used for the entire series as it currently requires importing a new file into a new PBI file for each video topic.
9j_EBt3RNrs,Thank you so much
9j_EBt3RNrs,"the column name Unit sold is ""sum of Units sold"" on my table yours only ""Units sold"", however the values are the same and the sum aggregation is used. can you explain why is that plz ?"
9j_EBt3RNrs,hey alex how are u i love ypur videos i am from india i want to pursue ms data science as my master degree from us currently i am my 3rd or final year of bsc hons. mathematics can u tell me this is enough to be a data scientist or statistician
9j_EBt3RNrs,Thanks
9j_EBt3RNrs,Great! Thanks a lot.
9j_EBt3RNrs,I hit the Like before watching video confidently.
9j_EBt3RNrs,Enjoyed the teaching.
9j_EBt3RNrs,Well explained! Thanks Alex.
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Hi Alex I have a req for a PBI report to convert and format it as income statement report which now currently was a matrix visual. So, all current month measures in one column and ytds under one column with descriptions as rows(revenue,expenditure and their totals etc)
Can you please let me know if this is possible or if we have any free template to download"
9j_EBt3RNrs,how do i get the data you use for your lessons so i can also practice along
9j_EBt3RNrs,This is an awesome video with some unique content.
9j_EBt3RNrs,Can't we use a Histogram for numerical data? It's basically the same right having bins calculated and everything
9j_EBt3RNrs,jalapenos
9j_EBt3RNrs,Is this the last Power BI videos or will other come?
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Could you do a vídeo About Adobe Analytics?

To everyone watching please like this comment to help it to reach Alex, I recently started in a company that uses this tool and some of his videos would be a lot helpfull, to get an overview or at least a comparison with other tools such as Google Analytics etc"
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Hi,Alex, i have a request, could you start internship for new learners , i hope this very helpful for us."
9j_EBt3RNrs,🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏thanks a lotttttt.....please do more power bi videos ☺☺☺☺☺
9j_EBt3RNrs,"Hey Alex,Can u suggest me few videos or any resources for SQL interview questions???
It will be really helpful for me.
Thanks for ur valuable time."
9j_EBt3RNrs,best

m0h3Ghl6mgY,"we <3 you, thanks"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Great Lesson!
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Had to change the colors I'm red green color blind but good video
m0h3Ghl6mgY,completed 13 Dec
m0h3Ghl6mgY,❤❤❤
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Hi Alex, While practising the Conditional formatting on my end, I noticed I could use the data bar on them without aggregating the values for the Price and Revenue columns."
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thank you for the first minute I literally searched everywhere on where to find that option and couldnt find a simple tutorial. Thanks bro
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"hello team, my Power Bi does not show conditional formatting, what can i do please"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,i highly disagree with duct tape being useless during the apocalypse!
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Always use pastel colours 🙂
m0h3Ghl6mgY,However Iam unable to download the data-set for conditional formatting for practicing
m0h3Ghl6mgY,how to show duplicate name in conditional formatting
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Hello,

I need help with Power BI. When I convert my page to a PDF, I encounter two issues:

When the table has more data, there is a page break, meaning all the data is not shown in the PDF.
When I select another slicer to filter the data, the resulting PDF has less data but also empty spaces on the page.
Is there a way to dynamically adjust the page size (canvas size) based on the selected filters? Specifically, if the data is extensive, the page size should increase to include all the data in the PDF. Conversely, if the data is limited, the table should be printed without empty spaces."
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thanks a lot those tutorials are amazing!
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Mind BLOWN!!!
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Please create Power BI intermediate and advanced tutorials. This Tutorial series has been very helpful for me.
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Not sure if anyone is still monitoring these comments but I’m curious if you can use conditional formatting to compare values across rows instead of columns?
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Hello Alex, just one thing, column ""Revenue"" is actually a column ""Profit"", according to calculation."
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Very useful.  Thank you!
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Great video! Thanks.
m0h3Ghl6mgY,THIS IS COOL! please - can you show me how to customize the Y-axis data labels please? i need a specific color for 1 particular item.. on the y-axis.. thx.. Cherian from Abu Dhabi .. 29.Feb.2024
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Is there way to highlight the matrix name as well if the score not met as per define target for last 3 months in that case ?
m0h3Ghl6mgY,I learned more with one video from alex than my whole BootCamp with my school. THANK YOU ALEX!!!!!
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Very helpful, thank you Alex!"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"I have seen tons of PBI tutorials, lots of them showing some cool features and how they do it. But that was actually not what I wanted because that was not gonna work for me. But this series is really helpful, step-by-step explained very thoroughly for an Excel user like me. And I must say I am gonna watch this again. Big Thanks, Mr. Alex."
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"This was definitely helpful! I love learning how to make our visualizations better. Again, I really appreciate every time you emphasize functions or tasks that YOU actually use for work. It helps me star my notes. * = remember and review because Alex says it's important. :) As always, THANK YOU!!"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"I want to create two new NUMERIC columns, copies of existing TRUE/FALSE columns.
How should I do this, with IF() function?"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"What I am not able to do is conditionally format a date , by itself, if it is before Today.
So If I wanted to conditionally format passed dates in a Grey font for example and any future dates remain black font (all part of the same column)...I cannot seem to be able to crack the conditions required.
Any suggestions?"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Alex Thank You, Thank You, Thank You <3"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thank you Alex.
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Thank you so much Sir. Hi Alex, Will there be intermediate or expert Bootcamp series?."
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thanks Alex
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Hi Alex, Will there be intermediate or expert Bootcamp series?"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"for some reason I cant find Conditional Formatting. Even the data does not display as table some times. Any fix guys?
It works in the other datasets, I want to know why it does  not work here"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,thank you
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Any chance you have a git/github tutorial on the horizon?
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"I'd opt for a more accessible color palette, such as blue and orange. Red/Green color combos are nightmares for color blind stake holders."
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thank you so much Sir
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"HI Alex ,

I'm trying to shift to a data analyst role from a developer , it has been a bit rough I must say , could you please give me few tips or suggestions to reach there faster. Would really appreciate it.

P.S. You are the reason for this switch of career path , love your videos. Thanks"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Hey alex thanks for sharing your knowledge with us please let us know when project video is coming?
m0h3Ghl6mgY,I can’t wait to see the Python learning series! 😃
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thank you Alex! I sure will start doing more conditional formatting with my tables.
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Dear Alex.

I hope you are doing well. 

I am your follower on LinkedIn and I must say that you always post/share very informative stuff to help others.

I am (37) a Chartered Accountant by profession and what to pursue rest of my career in data analytics and science but I really dont know from where to start as lots of information is available on this subject and there is no standard to follow. 

I would highly appreciate if you can pls guide me about how can I start this new career and in case there are any internationally recognised institutes from where I can do related certifications. 

Thank you for sparing your time and support.

Kind Regards"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"Hey Alex, curious as to why you right click the values instead of going to the format tab?

I know it is not much of a difference but I have never right clicked and definitely will take a look at it!"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,"for power bi tutorials, can you please use a larger and black version of the mouse pointer please. it's a small accessibility point but makes following the cursor much easier"
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thanks Alex
m0h3Ghl6mgY,This is a great one. Thank you Alex
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Series I've been waiting for💃
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Thank you sir 💓
m0h3Ghl6mgY,Nice one. Pls share your mail I'd. Thanks
50D__p6jdEI,"Not learning the basics

50D__p6jdEI,Thanks Alex! :)
50D__p6jdEI,Hey Alex I love love your channel!!! I’m starting my data Analyst course next month watching your videos definitely has me more prepared. Super excited and this career change it’s time btw im 33 my background warehouse
50D__p6jdEI,This is so educative
50D__p6jdEI,"Great presentation,  really helpful.  I am thinking about looking/really interested in making the switch. I'm coming from Clinical research/Healthcare business and  some project coordination.  What would you say is the stress level of a data analyst in this field 🤔.   I'm trying to go to the normal- healthy  amount of stress. 
Your videos have been helpful,  and I'm planning to do your bootcamp Alex"
50D__p6jdEI,Mistake #1: Becoming a Data Analyst
50D__p6jdEI,Kwabena from  Ghana
50D__p6jdEI,There's thousands of videos on YouTube about data analytics and what the job's like but this is the first video of it's kind that I've seen. Really valuable information shared for a first jobber. Thanks very much for your insights. When I eventually get a job in data analytics I'll be sure to bear these tips in mind.
50D__p6jdEI,Great video!
50D__p6jdEI,How do I get projects?
50D__p6jdEI,Great advice!
50D__p6jdEI,I just started working as a Data Analyst and this video is really helpful. Thank you Alex!
50D__p6jdEI,Such a good idea to use a portfolio more so for reference during the interview than to get the interview.
50D__p6jdEI,sometimes people are really idiots and they lack this capability of properly expressing what exactly they need and thus they confuse people and when they get the result they do say this is not what they asked for. Stupid!
50D__p6jdEI,You and I are two peas in a pod! Wish I had found your video 5 months ago when I started my new position dealing heavily in data presentations.
50D__p6jdEI,Wonderful Information for a a person like me just starting out
50D__p6jdEI,"Yes, you are a good communicator for sure."
50D__p6jdEI,Iam getting my certification with google data analytics this year at 50 Iam nerves but excited to transition into tech. Thank you Alex for your Chanel
50D__p6jdEI,@alex how do you pick a specialist in data analytics?
50D__p6jdEI,@alex What is your specialty as a data analyst?
50D__p6jdEI,Wow.  When I first went college I was going into Rec Therapy!  I wanted to work for Outward Bound.
50D__p6jdEI,"Alex, your content is always helpful.  I will be graduating with a BS in analytics in December at the age of 52.  I have been working with data for 6 years.  I often question whether I know “enough.”  I appreciate your videos very much.  Thank you."
50D__p6jdEI,"This very informative, despite me isn't in data analyst background..."
50D__p6jdEI,AlexTheDataInspiration
50D__p6jdEI,"Awesome video, thank you very much all!"
50D__p6jdEI,Phenomenal Content!!
50D__p6jdEI,"Today is the Teacher's day, being celebrated in India. Happy Teacher's Day to my Teacher who piqued my interest in Data Analytics and making me get going. Thank you❤️"
50D__p6jdEI,"I have studied Human recources and I am currently working in the operations sector. Lately, I have a great interest in data analytics and would like to make a shift in my career. Watching this and knowing myself, I'd probably do all of the mistakes, especially the last one. It is a great webinar to watch and reflect on. Thank you!"
50D__p6jdEI,"I enjoyed so much watching your videos, Alex! I made up my mind to enroll myself in the Analytic course. Your topics will serve as a guide to individuals who wants to shift career=stability + high paying job!"
50D__p6jdEI,"It was a pleasure working with you Alex, what a great presentation! Thanks again!"
50D__p6jdEI,Sir!  Thanks for sharing your experience.....
50D__p6jdEI,"Good day Mr. Alex  well done sir 
I am new here and I am interested in becoming a data analyst. I need your sincere advice on how to actualise this."
50D__p6jdEI,Alex do you see AI replacing Data Analysis in the nearest future (10-20 years) and thus lead data analysts to extinction? What's the likelihood of that happening? Thanks!
50D__p6jdEI,Thanks for sharing everything about ur career..A big fan from India.
50D__p6jdEI,"An absolutely  brilliant  presentation.... ! Thank you , Alex."
50D__p6jdEI,Thanks so much for this! Smallish request: A vid on documentation please Alex...😬
50D__p6jdEI,Tableau or Power BI??
50D__p6jdEI,"Love this one, especially #6. Thanks a lot!"
50D__p6jdEI,"At my previous job, asking questions mostly was an inconvenience or an annoyance... so even though I asked questions, I realized that I rather figure it out myself. Definitely one of the reasons I quit in the first place."
50D__p6jdEI,"Thank you for all the videos. The amount of information you give away is amazing. How do you decide which tool (excel, sql, or python) to use when cleaning data?"
50D__p6jdEI,thanks Alex powerful insights
50D__p6jdEI,I think I will give careerfoundry a try... their job placement guarantee and affordable pricing sound good to me.
50D__p6jdEI,It's a super helpful webinar Alex. Thanks for sharing your experience!
50D__p6jdEI,My best mentor 'ALEX THE ANALYST'
50D__p6jdEI,When do you sleep? You're Mr. Data 24/7.
50D__p6jdEI,love you Alex😍
50D__p6jdEI,"Where do you sign for a mentorship? I have looked through your Youtube ""about"" page, IG, web page and cant find it"
50D__p6jdEI,"Fascinating. I've been a data analyst for 7 months now. It's been a hit or miss on my reports but lately it's been more of a, repetitive atmosphere where I can run reports and remember formulas and pivots and finding data. Your content is very helpful. This wasn't a first career choice or a priority? So I really want to back track and get more involved in maybe courses for analytics."
50D__p6jdEI,"Mistake #1:  5:57 Not learning the basics

50D__p6jdEI,thank you for this video
50D__p6jdEI,"I'd like to say at around 20:00 or so, my issue is what you said was the fun part. I like messing with the numbers, making sure they are right, forcing them to tell me what I want to know, but I'm kinda clueless when it comes to Dashboards. What to put on there, how to present it. I like the hard numbers, so I have difficulty imagining what or how to graph."
50D__p6jdEI,Very good presentation Alex! You’re 8 mistakes are spot on as it relates to my experiences as a data analyst only 2 years out of undergrad and having worked with multiple companies.
tRCGGlMI19M,Two of my favorite data nerds!! 🤓🤓Just popped some popcorn to watch🍿
tRCGGlMI19M,What crispy audio 👀
tRCGGlMI19M,"Alex, I don't think you need to ""make improvements"" to your videos, because a lot of your channel's appeal is the approachability of it. It's like you are having a one on one conversation with us and I don't get nervous about trying things that you suggest. But what do I know about growing a YT channel...nothing."
tRCGGlMI19M,"That applause at the end was really the most inspiring. I guess y'all said some good stuff, too."
tRCGGlMI19M,Great interview. This made me feel like I was next to you guys and kind of breaks that barrier that sometimes I put on thinking that it  might be too difficult to break into data science field. Keep on inspiring people Alex.
tRCGGlMI19M,Alex your food item should be a horseradish especially after the spiel you did about horseradishes in one of your videos. I thought it was funny and I also like horseradish (sauce) on my sandwiches.
tRCGGlMI19M,Large jockes wearing glasses :)
tRCGGlMI19M,"success ingredient for someone like Alex, Ken, Luke, Tina or the many Data bright minds , (humbleness) to express mistakes ""as normal human beings"" and in their mentoring (simplicity) amazing people and so happy there are creators like them."
tRCGGlMI19M,"great conversation.
thank you for doing this."
0QZBnhofU_U,"For more tips on how to get started in Data Analytics in 2022, follow CareerFoundry’s YouTube channel – and watch this video to learn the steps you need to take to successfully become a data analyst in 2022: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3FnCoKWmBg"
0QZBnhofU_U,Thank you it is a great start for me. One problem I got is the download is for 32 bit and my pc is 64 bit any solution
0QZBnhofU_U,Is the discount valid only when you pay upfront?
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex,
How valuable is the certificate?"
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex, 
I watched this and it really helped, but then I found Springboard data analytics bootcamp and it is pretty comparable to CF, except it also includes Power BI though seems less focused on Python. It's more expensive and is shorter. Do you have any thoughts about specifically these two bootcamps?"
0QZBnhofU_U,Is the program beginner friendly? Someone with zero knowledge?
0QZBnhofU_U,Would you recommend for a business analyst role ?
0QZBnhofU_U,"The ""have to be willing to relocate"" is a shitty cop out on their part..."
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex I’m trying to join CareerFoundry and when I mentioned the discount they said is expired only until 2022?
0QZBnhofU_U,"If you guys want to buy it, let me know. I already have it, and they have a promotion that you get $500 per referral for both. So just let me know."
0QZBnhofU_U,"Save yourself the money and time with this school. Too much fluff, SO much reading and the tutors are article happy.  All of my suggestions to the school were pretty much ignored. 

Don't waste your time and just use Alex's resources and other free ones you find online"
0QZBnhofU_U,Just seeing this vid. What's the likelihood of another discount coming through? Looking to start the full course this fall.
0QZBnhofU_U,How much would a entry level make with the job guarantee in this program ?
0QZBnhofU_U,"Sir, What do you think about masterschool? No money until someone get hired. I really don’t know that’s really work . please make a about it"
0QZBnhofU_U,What is your opinion of the Springboard bootcamp? Thanks
0QZBnhofU_U,Anyone complete the course and have a good experience landing a job???
0QZBnhofU_U,Do you suggest this Bootcamp to someone his English level is intermediate? My idea is to improve confidence and speaking
0QZBnhofU_U,Hi Alex! Thanks for the review. Very informative! Is the 20% off still valid? Thank you!
0QZBnhofU_U,"Thank you for the review. I'm doing the free course right now and searched for reviews to make sure I wasn't getting into something that was useless. The only other time I had looked into a bootcamp I was disheartened at the price. I am thankful the introductory course is available foran easy price because it will take more than the free part for me to decide to shell out several thousand dollars for this.  I am dipping my toe into finding another career and data analytics keeps coming up.  Unfortunately, based on a brief search locally, I don't think I will be able to replace my current income but I figure pursuing the skills will still be fruitful.  I was wondering how much prior knowledge of SQL, python, or other languages might I need?"
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex, I am currently an international students in Syd Aus. I wanna ask whether this bootcamp can have job guarantee as DA in Australia if i dont have citizenship yet."
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hey Alex, I’m a recent grad at the University of Michigan. I’m equipped with a bachelors in economics and minor in entrepreneurship, as well as elementary programming concepts covered in some of my first-year courses and more advanced statistics and econometrics courses. I want to land a job in data analytics but have found myself scrolling thru jobs that require a couple of years of industry experience, which has brought my career to a halt. Any advice?"
0QZBnhofU_U,How long will the discount last? I’m in the process of moving countries and not sure how long till I get settled with all legal stuff
0QZBnhofU_U,you sound pretty biased. stopped watching after 10 mins.
0QZBnhofU_U,"Are there any good places to buy *just* the mentorship? I feel like I can learn most of the technical skills on my own, but I really need to find a mentor. I would rather be able to just pay to consult with a mentor a few times per month."
0QZBnhofU_U,How would you compare it with General Assembly Data Science Immersive?
0QZBnhofU_U,Make investments in yourself! I am starting this boot camp as well!
0QZBnhofU_U,does this bootcamp offer access to the programs? like do I need to have tableu or excel?
0QZBnhofU_U,Outside of the mentorship and the tutor aspect of the course.  How does this course stack up against  the Google's DA course though Coursera?
0QZBnhofU_U,"I would say data camp is more appealing to me, they cover projects, they teach every important skills required and make you practice as well..from excel to ML..that too in just £25 per month❤"
0QZBnhofU_U,Great work really was looking for something that I can get mentorship with and this sounds like a good deal to me!
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex, are there other ways to get the mentorship without a bootcamp?"
0QZBnhofU_U,You lost me at $7000. I'm from Africa
0QZBnhofU_U,bootcamps are irrelevant at this point...way too many resources available these days
0QZBnhofU_U,"Alex, if you, the Master data analyst made a 70% on the test then this doesn't bode well for the rest of us!"
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex. I just want to say THANK YOU and to tell you how much I appreciate your content. Your tutorials, portfolio series and interview tips have helped me so much to finally land my dream job as a Business Intelligence Analyst. Thank you!"
0QZBnhofU_U,Waiting for Masters Programs in Business Analytics/ Data Analytics in USA
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex, interesting! I actually subscribed CF Channel before, l would be interested if the cost can be lower!"
0QZBnhofU_U,"Year ago you made a video about 
Bootcamp is a waste of money and
Today you are advising people to do it.
Come on Alex, We like your videos but don’t be greedy."
0QZBnhofU_U,"Its USD 5,500 🥵
Thats expensive"
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hi Alex, I would love to see how your review  of World Quant University Applied Data Science Lab."
0QZBnhofU_U,"The stipulations of the money back guarantee are a bit sketchy IMHO. They can find you a job paying $40k, extremely underpaid, and if you decline - boom there goes your money back perk"
0QZBnhofU_U,"Meh, I'm just not convinced. It just seems like an expensive super-google data analytics course. I don't see how well this course will prepare anyone for building portfolio projects and that type of experience is what we need to show potential employers since many of us will not have experience or background as a data analyst. This just feels like  a ""teach yourself"" bootcamp service. Everything I have seen can be learned online for free in under a year as well if one were so inclined."
0QZBnhofU_U,"I don't know what to say about the job guarantee...
It says on their site that if you are offered work that is at least 15 hours a week, that it qualifies as a job offer.  Essentially part time with little hours.  I feel like people that take those kind of offers just won't be valued as much by their companies.  
Also, since it's 15 hours does that also include freelance and contractor work.  Data analytics is such a broad term that I wonder if the guarantee actually covers real data analysis positions."
0QZBnhofU_U,Happy to see this after seeing your other thoughts on bootcamps... I'm partway through acheivement 3 in the data immersion course with CareerFoundry. So far so good!
0QZBnhofU_U,I’ve been looking to make the switch from pursing a career/grad school in Physical Therapy but have always been hesitant to sign up for a boot camp. This one is definitely one of the best I’ve seen thus far and I’ll look more into it. Seems like a solid price for what you’re getting too.
0QZBnhofU_U,"Love your content! I find a lot of inspiration and value in your content,  Cheers!"
0QZBnhofU_U,"I'll definitely look further into this program. I'm glad the job gurantee specifies a job related to data analytics, a lot of bootcamps just gurantee for any job whether coding related or not so that alone gives this one a step up"
0QZBnhofU_U,Wow this sounds realty great. I wish I knew about this before the google program. This isn't currently in my budget
0QZBnhofU_U,"So, the job guarantee only applies if you live in the U.S.?"
0QZBnhofU_U,"You lost me at ""sponsor of this video: CareerFoundry"" lol."
0QZBnhofU_U,"Hey Alex,
Hope you are doing Great.  Is the Job gaurantee is for whole world or for only US based Citizenship? Because i don't want to end up like Google Data Analytics Certificate, which says it's only for US based citizenship ?
Thanks"
0QZBnhofU_U,First time seeing a 22 minute long advertisement
0QZBnhofU_U,So I’m about 75% done with the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Does CF go much deeper into the skills where it would be worth it to enroll after the certificate course or is there too much crossover?
0QZBnhofU_U,I started watching your videos 6 months ago working in a warehouse and now im a junior data analyst.
0QZBnhofU_U,I am currently doing this course. It has been a fantastic/seamless process so far. I’m 2 months in and the mentor/tutor support is amazing. I would recommend this course to anybody looking to get into a Data Analytics fast track career course. Will keep this community up to date when I finish and get a my first job !!!! - Billy Fowler II

ulFY20KTzFQ,"The dataset is not saving/downloading,I've been battling with it for a while now, different browsers and networks same thing,
Pls help."
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thanks for this Alex
ulFY20KTzFQ,Nice
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hey alex when I put a legend on costume, my bar turns so skinny. Anyway to prevent this?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,thank you for sharing this Alex!! i find it very helpful
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Quick update Everyone , Anybody with New Version , You might need to transform data and remove summarization from the Column, or just do it manually form the Table to get the Columen tools and look at Summarization  click on ""Remove summarization"" et Voila."
ulFY20KTzFQ,compeleted 12 December
ulFY20KTzFQ,❤❤❤
ulFY20KTzFQ,there is no option here to not Summarize
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Why does my PowerBI default the title to 'Sum of Price by Store, Product, and Product' when yours just defaults to 'Price by Store and Product'. Similarly, my Y-axis defaults to 'Sum of Price' and yours defaults to just 'Price'"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Please please... highlight your cursor, so it can be seen what you are pointing at.  some us do not have good sight to follow the tiny cursor.  thank you"
ulFY20KTzFQ,thanks
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hey. When I download the data, I do not see the purchase tracker table in it."
ulFY20KTzFQ,"I find people do NOT want to drill down.  They rather want a tab at each level where they have filters they can set that vary by level.  When I do drill down, people always say, can you just make that level as a tab where I can have controls at that level.  Total, sub total, then sub sub total, it always seems better than drilling into the different levels.  The key is, the filters change at the lower levels and you simply gain more filters.  This seems to be WAY more intuitive and I never get requests for drill when people see the levels on tabs.  If the records are not massive, I can have the last tab be full detail so people can do anything on their own in some other tool with the raw data."
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thanks so much Alex.. Making it simple for the past 3 weeks..
ulFY20KTzFQ,i Have learned so much. You truly have a talent for coaching and imparting knowledge. More success ...
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you Alex you have an amazing way of teaching simple and very informative. I appreciate your efforts.
ulFY20KTzFQ,I enjoy that you are smiling as you speak in the beginning. It makes your videos and you as the teacher feel very approachable. Great EI!
ulFY20KTzFQ,Nice but shallow. I would like to see more complex things. Like grid with few aggregations (eg. 3 cols) and drill down to show all unique details under it (eg. 10 cols).
ulFY20KTzFQ,Excellent
ulFY20KTzFQ,"I really see the value of using drill down--saves time and space (don't have to do as many separate visualizations). As always, THANK YOU ALEX!"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Is it possible to drill down in a ""Table"" visual? or does it have to be a histogram?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,How can it be that your bars are always sorted in descending order?
ulFY20KTzFQ,I get count of customer and sum of price when I drag customer and price in Y-axis. How can I just insert customer and price?
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Thank you for this. I have a question though. What does this legend mean exactly? when creating charts, because i noticed that once you drag an item to the legend, it displays in differ colours."
ulFY20KTzFQ,Very useful.. Thanks
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Thank you so much for that, you really made efforts for us."
ulFY20KTzFQ,"For those who have the updated PowerBI version here is what you need to do in order to see the visualization in the order that is shown in this video:
Go to the three dots on the frame of the visualization -> Price -> Sort Descending and unmark the Sort Legend. Now it is ordered correctly.
On why it writes ""Sum of Price"", it's probably because of an Update for PowerBI Desktop Version, For that you can just rename it :""Price"" on the field itself. It has the same data."
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Can drill down be applied to other tables? For example. in this video the Apocalypse Sales and Purchase Tracker tables don't have any relationship, I want to drill down for Units Sold in each product for each store the the Units Sold column is in another table. Does drill down can still be applied even if the next level is on the other table and the first level is on another different table?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"1:52 Hey Alex Sir, In my case whenever I drag down ""Product"" option in x-axis, it is by default drilled down even though I've tried to do it multiple times.... Is it because of the updated version of Power Bi that I've installed from Microsoft Store or it could be something else?? Please help"
ulFY20KTzFQ,Immediately subscribed.
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Awesome tutorial, thank you!!!"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hey Alex, the ""Price"" is either showing as ""Sum of Price"" OR ""Count of Price"". How do I get only 'Price'?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"this was really cool, thanks, great series <3"
ulFY20KTzFQ,Done
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you so much alex sir....
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you Alex
ulFY20KTzFQ,Your videos are fantastic! But I need to know something after watch them... Are you a prepper?
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hi, Alex, I would like to congratulate you for putting so much effort into these  high-quality free videos. I'd love to know if you plan to do ""intermediate"" PowerBI Tutorial series. Or if you have a course in Udemy it will be great."
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hey Alex, i have a problem with drill down. Im tryin to follow your bar chart until on minute 5:05, when i doin the drill down then click one of the customer, the Y-axis is goin to be ""Uncle Joe's Prep Shop 7616"", so i can't see the order id. any recommendation to solve this? Thank u so much Sir!"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hey Alex, Loving this series but have a question.. Whenever I click/ drag one of the fields , it renames  it into ""Sum of ""[field name], This happened in the DAX video as well. How can I change this?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"i keep getting sum of price in the visualizations instead of just the price values, please how do i fix this?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,It is easy for data analysts to control the drill down but business users always gets confused about it.
ulFY20KTzFQ,Thank you 🙂
ulFY20KTzFQ,DAX made me sad....but Drill Down in Power BI seems more straight forward and quick than Tab.
ulFY20KTzFQ,"So when I create the second graph, when I go down one level, the name of the customer stays on the label along side the order ID instead of just showing the Order ID. Does anyone else have this issue? If so, could you fix it?"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hello sir, thanks for your videos. I'm learning quite a lot. Please, I'm having a challenge downloading your datasets for all the Power BI tutorials. I keep having errors opening them all."
ulFY20KTzFQ,This new series is really flowing. My best teacher. Thank you
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Hi Alex, you said in one of your videos about the importance of recruiters if you are in the middle of nowhere and looking for a job, the problem I have is that I am not a US citizen. Almost every job response that I get is that they can't hire noncitizens, what should I do, and are there recruiters for the global job seeker?
Thank you very much"
ulFY20KTzFQ,What is going on everybody..what is more consistent 🔥
ulFY20KTzFQ,Is it math important to be a data analyst?
ulFY20KTzFQ,How it gonna take to become  a data analyst for someone has no experience in data field  at all ?
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Thanks for this, Alex! I would like to know if you have a preference towards PBI or Tableau? I have used Tableau for 3 years but have a job offer and they use PBI!"
ulFY20KTzFQ,"Always love your new videos! I hope to help more people one day by having a wider reach like you, so your content motivates me a lot. Cheers!"

PEc29sRZoTM,can you explain difference between data analyst in finance and financial analyst?
PEc29sRZoTM,"Can the Business Analytics Specialization from Wharton Online be taken with Excel for Mac?

It does say that a full version of Excel is needed and Excel for Windows is not the exact same as Excel for Mac.

Does anyone here know?"
PEc29sRZoTM,I just started looking at them. I’m very excited about learning IT and data analytics
PEc29sRZoTM,I have a question about technical documentation what does that normally consists of as a Business Analyst?
PEc29sRZoTM,"Sir, Genuine advice needed

PEc29sRZoTM,"Hello Alex, 
I hope you are doing well :)
I am currently enrolled in Google data analytics program and completed course. I have some doubts regarding the data analyst roles.
1. Does data analyst communicate with stockholders and business owners and have to ask questions? 

2. I am interested in technical part of this role so i would like to know what data analyst do most of the time?

Bit confused and lost need some advice"
PEc29sRZoTM,"I really love your videos,they are very informative and I must commend that ya really doing a good job...please I would like you to do a video of data analystics syllabus as I intend to start learning it on my own"
PEc29sRZoTM,Can an etl developer become a data analyst in a few years? please tell us a career path of an etl developer to data analyst or data engineer
PEc29sRZoTM,"Very informative as always Alex. 
Quick question please: Since Financial analyst, Business Analyst, Marketing analyst and Sports analyst are domain-specific analyst roles, what particular domain is particularly suitable to a Data analyst? 
I personally think a data analyst encompasses all data roles including the above-mentioned domain-specific roles. So when u say you are not a Financial analyst or business analyst, am thinking ""how, but you are a data analyst""
What's your thoughts on this please?"
PEc29sRZoTM,"Hey Alex,

From one Alex to another, you gotta do a video providing a shoutout to the Risk Analysts! Such as myself 😂!"
PEc29sRZoTM,"Hello Alex, I just recently (yesterday :) discovered your channel and I am very excited to learn more about becoming a data analyst! Do you have any videos where you describe your process for learning new skills in terms of how you structured your studying, and other aspects of your learning environment while taking courses through Coursera, etc.? Thank you so much for offering your expertise!! Angelina"
PEc29sRZoTM,"Would love to see some YTD, QTD, MTD, custom periods, etc., how to switch views from, say, YTD to MTD, and, in general, more complex use cases of Tableau. I m using these a lot at work, and I wish I had known them when I started out. Drag and drop won't cut it; the power of Tableau is understanding calculated fields & LOD & param. If you want a job in this field, those are a must."
PEc29sRZoTM,"I was blessed to be a financial analyst. It would help if you had introductory algebra & statistics experience overall!!! Accounting would help as well! (:

Excel and python is a good skills, but you need a cornerstone of math first."
PEc29sRZoTM,"Hello Alex, Thank you for the excellent insightful videos about data analytics. I would like to ask, if you could provide some information in your future videos about the role of data analytics in aviation and any specific course that we could take."

Unfortunately, I don't want to do supervisor or manager or financial work. I really didn't do that much data analytics for my second degree, more on administration and electronic medical records. Can anyone provide advice ?"
PEc29sRZoTM,Financial analysis looks very interesting but very hard path 🙂💔
PEc29sRZoTM,The Wharton Online courses are very credible but don't expect the quality of the Google certifications. They are more lectures than anything else and the quizzes are mostly to see if you memorized the content. I'd highly recommend picking up books to complete your studies.
PEc29sRZoTM,Hi. I would have loved to know your recomendations for healthcare data analysis enthusiasts. I look forward to your input. :)
PEc29sRZoTM,"Hi Alex! As always, amazing data for us, investing your time to save ours!!! Thanks!! Almost finished my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, then will add some other courses, because I found it a little bit shallow for my taste xD Have a great day!"

PEc29sRZoTM,"Hello sir 
Currently i m in first year of my engineering UG and have interest in Finance and side by side my learning skills to be a Data Analyst.

PEc29sRZoTM,Could you also do a review of how effective these courses are/have been for someone who took these?
PEc29sRZoTM,"Hi Alex, thanks for the video. I'm making a career shift right now to data analysis and my main focus is the consultation domain, what courses should I follow or should I be a general data analyst?"
PEc29sRZoTM,Oh hey I've taken some of these. Mostly the Tableau one. :D
PEc29sRZoTM,"Hi Alex, 

I would like to thank you for all the effort you have done in your videos, 
I would like to ask about the Product Analyst and Supply Chain Analyst is there a good place to start because I have been searching and I could not find a good answer.

And thank you again for your efforts."
PEc29sRZoTM,I'm so happy you decided to do this. I'm currently enrolled in a Financial Analyst Course with CFI.
PEc29sRZoTM,Quick plug: for pure domain knowledge in digital marketing (although only one section is specifically on analytics) I recommend the new Google digital marketing course. It does have Analytics work throughout.
PEc29sRZoTM,Any word on your reviews on the Google courses?
PEc29sRZoTM,"Dear Alex,

First of all, thank you for another informative video.

I am interested in expanding my knowledge to data analytics and perhaps making a career change from Finance. Your videos have played a major part in that.

I would like to know if data analysts have a good career path for individual contributors (i.e. people who don't want to be team leaders and managers) like developers do or the ""ceiling is too low"" if you don't take the management route.

Many thanks,
Kostis"
PEc29sRZoTM,Are there any courses for Power BI?

vcijg0gUXSg,I'm getting  negative values in my Profit Column and Profit Column SUMx columns and I am doing the same steps. This is not for me and life is meaningless
vcijg0gUXSg,done 36/84
vcijg0gUXSg,"Wow, this video series is truly amazing Alex, I used to think Power BI was hard to learn, but just today I've learned a lot. Thanks for the cotent you share!"
vcijg0gUXSg,"i really thank you Alex, it's all really helpful"
vcijg0gUXSg,"hi, I don't understand where did Alex made a mistake at 9:04. I think his formula is correct, maybe I missed something. Is it syntax error (when assigning arguments to sumx) or his formula is literally incorrect?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi Alex i didn't understand the part at 9:02 of choosing the table, you chose Apocolypse Sales because we are in that table but we are actually in Apocolypse Store isn't it? can you explain that?"
vcijg0gUXSg,Idk this kind of makes no sense
vcijg0gUXSg,🤲🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏😊💐👍🥇
vcijg0gUXSg,"For this expression:
Profit Column SUMX = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales', 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * ('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))

I didn't understand on what basis the table name is given as Apocolypse Sales ? Is it based on which table you are creating the calculated column or like based on iteration.
If iteration, how to determine which table should be used because the expression is having fields from two tables?
Can some body help me with this explanation, this looks confused for me."
vcijg0gUXSg,"At 9:04 use this formulae to get correct result,

Profit = 
SUMX(
    RELATEDTABLE('Apocolypse Sales'),
    ('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]) * 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold]
)

RELATEDTABLE('Apocolypse Sales'): Gets all sales rows related to the current product (assuming a relationship exists between Store[Product ID] and Sales[Product ID]).

SUMX(...): Iterates through each matching sales row and computes profit per sale: (Price - Production Cost) * Units Sold, then sums it up."
vcijg0gUXSg,"9:27 apocalypse sales table is not right we're on apocalypse store,still the column was added ,how?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi, there is a new icon on the left called DAX to right queries it is new i think, i cant see it on the video so how we can work on that too?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"To get the right answer for the Profit field, kindly pay keen attention to the parenthesis used in the formula by @AlexTheAnalyst which goes thus; Profit = (SUM ('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))* SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold]). Thank me later 😃😃😃. Got stuck here earlier but God opened my eyes to that parenthesis i overlooked."
vcijg0gUXSg,The Best ❤❤❤❤
vcijg0gUXSg,"I noticed an issue with the use of SUMX in the video. The original approach didn't explicitly filter for matching Product ID, which could lead to incorrect aggregation. A better way to ensure accuracy is to use FILTER to include only relevant rows. Here's a corrected version of the code: 
Product Profit = SUMX(
    FILTER('Apocolypse Sales', 'Apocolypse Sales'[Product ID] = 'Apocolypse Store'[Product ID]), 
    'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * ('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])
)"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Nice Alex, you made this look simple"
vcijg0gUXSg,I dont know why mine is giving negative results in profit and the new column
vcijg0gUXSg,"why the f do i have this error 
""A single value for column 'Price' in table 'Apocolypse Store' cannot be determined. This can happen when a measure formula refers to a column that contains many values without specifying an aggregation such as min, max, count, or sum to get a single result."""
vcijg0gUXSg,"profit calculation with SUM is totally wrong. It should use Max, Min or Average, because using sum will aggregate the prices and costs of rows after filter."
vcijg0gUXSg,So helpful
vcijg0gUXSg,LOVE IT
vcijg0gUXSg,"Count of Sales, the sum of products sold could've done this even without DAX."
vcijg0gUXSg,"hello Alex, nice video series. I just wanted to ask a doubt - when we are calculating profit we use following DAX func - PROFIT = (SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))* SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])
Here the SUM of all the prices is done first? why are we using SUM at all when we are subtracting single values in Apocalypse_Store table?"
vcijg0gUXSg,this video and the previous ones were not explained properly
vcijg0gUXSg,"09:04
May I know why did we use 'Apocalypse Sales' instead of 'Apocalypse Store'? The table we are working on is 'Apocalypse Store'.
When I tried 'Apocalypse Store', it gave an error. 
As far I understand, Units Sold is in the 'Apocalypse Sales' Table, and maybe that's why it gave an error when I used 'Apocalypse Store', instead of 'Apocalypse Sales'.
Am I right?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Pro tip: every time you are not sure about something, especially a formula, ask ChatGPT to explain or correct it for you. It's making all the difference for me. I used to spend a lot of time searching something on the internet or asking on forums, which took a long time, but now I understand things almost instantly, with a ""particular teacher"" working for me 24/7."
vcijg0gUXSg,"I did the total of profit from the excel spreadsheet . i added them together by product and the total is $43212.43 not $434,754.87 what we are seeing now."
vcijg0gUXSg,"i don't think the total of profit correct. it should be $43212.43 not $434,754.87. Please advise"
vcijg0gUXSg,"awesome work but @7:06 these number are not right, Total profit is 43K not 434K, I checked in excel and that because it multiply the profit for each item with the total sold item 3001 not total sold item per each item, to be honest I dont know how to fix that, does anyone know ?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Thank you so much Alex. This is a job well done. I am learning so fast through you.
For those having issues with the iteration explanation made by Alex, here is a brief description of how I understand it using the DAX expression that worked for me.

SUMX('Apocolypse Sales','Apocolypse Sales'[Sum_of_Products_Sold]) * ('Apocolypse Store'[Profit_Per_Product])

SUMX('Apocolypse Sales','Apocolypse Sales'[Sum_of_Products_Sold]) >>> This is the first part of the formular and what this part does is to establish the iterator, which is the Sum_of_Products_Sold from the Apocolupse Sales table. This iterator becomes a constant that is applied to each row of the Profit_Per_Product column in the Apocolypse Store table. So, for each row of the Profit_Per_Product column in the Apocolypse store table, the multiplicator factor is applied using the iterator constant which in this case is 3001.

 ('Apocolypse Store'[Profit_Per_Product]) represents the column whose individual rows are to be multiplied by the iterator constant.

SUMx tells the iterator constant to go row by row for the defined column.

NB: Here is the formular for Total_Profit_Per_Product = 'Apocolypse Store'[Profit_Per_Product] * SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])

I hope this helps"
vcijg0gUXSg,completed 12 Dec
vcijg0gUXSg,Could anyone in this community help me understand SUMx function and difference between sum and sumx. I couldn't able to understand from that example
vcijg0gUXSg,❤❤❤
vcijg0gUXSg,couldnt you do these in excel
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hello Alex, Can I make any func I want using  just AI?"
vcijg0gUXSg,Follow chandoo as well
vcijg0gUXSg,"Profit_Column_sumx = SUMX(RELATEDTABLE('Apocolypse Sales'), 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * ('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))"
vcijg0gUXSg,"I am sure that there are students who don't mind, but you lost me within 1 minute. I don't know what the goal is or what the end product is going to be. This is bad because I am working towards a goal but this tuts doesn't. The goal appears probably at the end, but by then I am totally lost. I need a structure when I start to orientate myself. Sorry"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hello @Alex. I'm pretty sure that the answer is this for the SUMX around 10:00:  

SUMX = CALCULATE(
    SUMX(
        'Apocolypse Sales',
        'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * 
        (RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))
    )
)"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Alex thank you so much! Your explanations are super easy to follow, and Power BI seems very intuitive as you explain it"
vcijg0gUXSg,Great video
vcijg0gUXSg,"From the comments I understand some formulas might be wrong , but going by simple maths , in the sales table create  total revenue , total cost measures and use them for profit measure. 

TotalRevenue = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales', 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Price]))
TotalCost = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales','Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))
Profit = 'Apocolypse Sales'[TotalRevenue]-'Apocolypse Sales'[TotalCost]

For the profit per product / profit column

Profit_per_product = SUMX(RELATEDTABLE('Apocolypse Sales'),'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold]* ('Apocolypse Store'[Price]-'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]))

I stand to be corrected and I believe Alex was right ,he just emphasized on the difference between SUM and SUMX inplace of correct output . Cheers"
vcijg0gUXSg,"5:40 From here on the video is wrong, all the formulas indicated are incorrect"
vcijg0gUXSg,The numbers that I got at 6:33 are - and I don't know what the problem is
vcijg0gUXSg,"I can't view the tables in Table View. In the model view everything is visible but not in the Table view. Can someone help, please? Do you know how I can fix that?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Thank goodness for chartGPT, I almost gave up for those freshers like me that struggled use this SUMX( 'Apocolypse Sales',('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]) * 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])"
vcijg0gUXSg,In my profit_column_sumx the values are showing in negative numbers
vcijg0gUXSg,"It is a great video. When I was going through it  I was little bit confused by the profit_column calculation as it was not matching with my pre-made profit_measure. 
so for little modification --->
Profit by Product = 
CALCULATE(
    (SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) * SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('Apocolypse Sales'),
        'Apocolypse Sales'[Product ID] = EARLIER('Apocolypse Store'[Product ID])
    )
)

-->here are 2 parts inside calculate(). One is the equation and another is the filter().
The filter() gets only those product_ids from sales table that are present in the store table. After getting those product_ids from sales table, it simply applies the formula on it.

I hope it helps.

Also luckily gives me same output as my profit_measure."
vcijg0gUXSg,You're amazing! thank you for explaining a complicated thing (for me) in a simple way.
vcijg0gUXSg,"Your column at 07:45 makes no sense to me. Take for example the nylon rope. You are doing (30.99 - 13.67) * 3001. But 3001 is the total amount of products that has been sold, not the amount of nylon rope that has been sold. So what are you even calculating? That number has no meaning."
vcijg0gUXSg,"your profit comes out to be 43,4754.87 and mine comes out to be 97,778.52 , how? 
@Alex"
vcijg0gUXSg,Guys can anybody tell me at 8:59 why alex used apocalypse sales instead of store because the table were using is store instead of sales?
vcijg0gUXSg,"Thanks so much, Alex"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Alex, I get it you just used some random examples to explain sum and sumx and you explained them pretty well.
But the profit result value is wrong, you can't calculate profit by (sum(all selling prices)-sum(all cost prices) * sum(all units)) because each product has different selling price and cost price.
correct method is: for each product = SP-CP * units sold(of that particular product)
then sum all these values
correct profit value = 43212.43

Love your content. helped me a lot"
vcijg0gUXSg,great explanation between sum and sumx function
vcijg0gUXSg,"Just wonder, have ever reconsile that data ? Because if i got manualy calculate all the transaction value which is (unit sold * price) is all total only 87,945.09. how cold your Dax calculate end up with profit 434,754.87

CMIIW"
vcijg0gUXSg,"the sumx function, first part you said ""Apocolypse sales"" but that table is actually ""Apocalypse store"", I do not understand... could you explain Alex?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hello Alex,
Hope you are doing amazing. I am doing your bootcamp and following all the steps. But I got stuck in this video because of PowerBI app. 

When I wanted to connect the workbook in the powerBI, it shows me this error message 
'THERE ARE PENDING CHANGES IN YOUR QUERIES THAT HAVEN’T BEEN APPLIED '

I waited hours and hours but it doesn't load the data.

What can I do?
Please help me with this?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Can someone please explain why in the SUMX experession:

"" Profit_Column_sumX = SUMX( 'Apocolypse Sales', ( ('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]) * 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] )  )""

We used ""Apocolypse Sales"" in this part ( SUMX(<table>, <expression>))and not ""Apocolypse Store"", even though we are adding the column to ""Apocolypse Store""??"
vcijg0gUXSg,can u make more videos on dax
vcijg0gUXSg,"hello
I Used The Sumx Just LIke The tutorial You'v been learn But The Power Bi Throws An Error About You Cant Use The UnitSold Column Of The Second Dataset May Any One Help Me ???
The Full Error Is :
' single value for column in table cannot be determined. This can happen when a measure formula refers to a column that contains many values without specifying an aggregator such as min, max, count, or sum to get a single result. '"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi Alex, after the getting the Profit.. I placed the customer over the profit but it didn’t split the profit between the customers.. it was showing the total figure in front of all the customers.. What to do anybody😢😢"
vcijg0gUXSg,"hii alex
can you create a  detailed power bi project video which explains all dax functions"
vcijg0gUXSg,"is it a bad practice that I did this 
Profit = (SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) * [Total product sold] 
instead of this
 Profit = (SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) * SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold]?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi Alex, Nice to meet you, Indeed appreciable effort. I had a concern about the DAX chapter profit calculation . But when i was going to address it , i found the same from the other people. By the way, just curious to know why dont you edit the video or make a short video to revise it ? Thanks"
vcijg0gUXSg,This is so well explained & it definitely helped me in preparing a report as an assignment! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge & expertise!
vcijg0gUXSg,If you were stuck like me in the Profit colmun => Profit Column = ('Apocolypse Store'[Price]-'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])*SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])
vcijg0gUXSg,Iluv your videos but using DAX only for count is redundant and the example of SUMX looks great on the video but impossible to do it on PBI :(
vcijg0gUXSg,Alex is the GOAT 2024
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi, I am confused about the example you gave for SUMX. From my understanding, the function subtracts the production cost from the price of each product and multiples it by the total number of units sold (in this case 3001). Shouldn't we multiply by the number of products that sold for each unit. For example Nylon Rope's were sold 390 times and the profit for each nylon rope is $17.32. So wouldn't the total profit for Nylon Ropes be $17.32 x 390 which is $6754.80. The function is mutliplying $17.32 by 3001 which is $51977.32."
vcijg0gUXSg,Alex
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hello Alex 
i tried :TotalProfix = 
    SUMX('Apocolypse Store',('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]) * ('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])) 
but still cannot find apocolpyse sales table and giving me this MSG :
A single value for column 'Units Sold' in table 'Apocolypse Sales' cannot be determined. This can happen when a measure formula refers to a column that contains many values without specifying an aggregation such as min, max, count, or sum"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Alex, thank you so much for breaking this down. please i am finding it difficult to copy and paste the Dax formular from the bar"
vcijg0gUXSg,"DAX is pure, unadultered, pile of maggot dung... so is power bi."
vcijg0gUXSg,"Before I say anything, I'd like to thank you for this underrated course, I can't enrol in professional certificate courses cuz of financial burdens, but this course provides everything I need for free. 

On to the main point, I think you might have made some mistakes with the SUM and SUMX while calculating the profit for each product, as well as the table for the amount of profit each customer has made you in the reports section. 

1:  For the Profit column in the Apocalypse Store table, consider using the DAX Function ""('Apocolypse Store'[Price]-'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]) * [Units Sold]"" Where the [Units Sold] in the DAX function is a measure that contains the DAX function ""SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])"". 

2:  As for the table that contains the profit earned from each customer, I suggest you try the DAX function ""SUMX('Apocolypse Sales', 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * (RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])))"" which returns the correct profits earned from each customer.

It took me a few hours to figure out since I'm relatively new to Microsoft Power BI. If anyone sees this comment, let me know if this works for you"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hey Alex, I was doing the math and the value of the profit per item is WRONG. It is multiplying [price - cost] of the product 10001 by the total of units sold (3001), therefore the value of 59k of profit. The corret value is multiplied by 390 (Total amount sold of the item 10001) which result a total of 6754,8. 
I tried to fix it in my Power BI but, since I'm learning, I couldn't find a solution. If you ever see this comment or anyone who knows how to fix it, please teach me!"
vcijg0gUXSg,"9:00
Hey Alex, I think you made a mistake here... isn't the table we're referring to ""Apocalypse Store"" and not ""Apocalypse Sales""?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hey Alex,
What to do if left function isn’t working on a column and you need to get 7-8 characters from the left of that column in another column. Please Advise"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hey Alex , 
You are an amazing teacher for real. Thanks a lot for explaining these concepts so well . Its really helping all of aspiring Data and Business Analyst a lot. I really feel your videos are very engaging and so informative ."
vcijg0gUXSg,"Can someone please help me with the correct code for profit and sumx 
When I run mine my values are incorrect and are in negative 
Thank you 
Alex"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Can someone please help me with the correct code for profit and sumx 
When I run mine my values are incorrect and are in negative 
Thank you 
Alex"
vcijg0gUXSg,"I am followining your tutorial with Power BI open, and performing all the calculations. Sometimes PBI miscalculates some tables, but then suddenly returns to the correct results, I dont know the causes, but I think is becuse the movement of fields when doing the work"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi Alex, thank you very much for this clear and well articulated video. Makes the learning experience a bit easier. To more tutorials and development :)"
vcijg0gUXSg,Hello Alex Thank you so much for sharing this. I think you made an error at 09:04 . I think first you were supposed to calculate profit for each Product which will be  Profit_for_each Product = 'Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost] then you calculate total_profit for each product  which will be Total_Profit = 'Apocolypse Sales'[Sum of Products Sold] * 'Apocolypse Store'[Profit_for_each Product]
vcijg0gUXSg,"In 9:06 , I think why we are using 'Apocalypse Sales' as the table is because Price and Production Cost are already aggregated and populated in all rows but Units Sold is just a row. So we would need to aggregate or iterate it, which is why we are using the table that contains Units Sold.

At least, that's how i understand it 🤷🏾‍♂️"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Wow! This video was packed full of little gems. I really enjoyed learning the difference between SUM and SUMx as well as the IF statement at the end of the video. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Easier solution: First make a profit column: Profit_column = 'Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]
Second make a Total profit column: Total_profit = 'Apocolypse Store'[Profit_column] * SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])"
vcijg0gUXSg,"At 9:04 It is mentioned that Apocalypse Sales is the table we are looking here, but the table we were working on was Apocalypse Store. Can you explain that part please? Also, when I tried to change the Sales to Store in the SUMX, it gave error. I am new to PowerBI, so maybe asking a bad question, but it would be helpful if I could get an explaination. Thanks."
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hey everyone. Hope you all are having a good time learning power BI. I just started the video series and had a doubt regarding the SumX feature. At 9:06 he says, he is applying sumx in the table 'apocalypse sales' so he writes it in the formula, but actually he is applying it in the table 'apocalypse store'. Can anyone explain why he wrote sales instead of store at the beginning of the SumX formula? Or is it just to call in the table into the formula?"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hello I have question for you 
when i create visualization table with (product name and profit column ) and (product name and profit column sumx) gave me different answer why this happen?"
vcijg0gUXSg,im gettinga -5k profit from the formula lmao wtf
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hey Alex, I got different results for the profits when I broke it down by the Product. So I figured that your formula was multiplying by total units = 3001 instead of individual units sold for each product. To solve that, I created two separate profit formulae under Aplocolypse store table  for simplicity. The first one was this: Unitary Profit = SUMX('Apocolypse Store',('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - ('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) and the second one was this: Total Profit = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales',('Apocolypse Store'[Unitary Profit])*('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])). The math seemed to have worked out when I used these in the visualization tables. Ex. Unitary profit for backpack is 13.07 and units sold is 212 so total Profit for backpack = $2770.84. My profit for all products came out to be $43,212.43"
vcijg0gUXSg,"Hi Alex smth is off here,,,,
An accurate example
single unit Product selling price: $10

single unit Product manufacturing cost: $5
Units sold: 100
Profit = (10 - 5) * 100 = $500

BUT 
Sum of Product selling price - sum of Product manufacturing cost multiplied by sum of units is inaccurate
(1000 - 500)*100 =$50,000
I got confused for a little bit while following the Video."
vcijg0gUXSg,"Thanks for this Sir Alex! 
Really helpful series."
vcijg0gUXSg,"Iam unable to download the dataset, can somebody please help me out"
vcijg0gUXSg,Great video!  def feeling more comfortable with DAX expressions!
vcijg0gUXSg,"as a tableau developer, i prefer tableau calculated field tbh"
vcijg0gUXSg,Thank you very much alex. Please in the second example I have the same results by clicking unit sold without creating a new measure its looks like sum of unit sold already exist in the Apocolypse sales table
vcijg0gUXSg,Very helpful
vcijg0gUXSg,"hey i calculated the value manually for the profit just to cross verify but am getting different values than the one when i use the formula from the video, i am using the exact dataset provided by you and am following the video step by step thoroughly. please do reply if possible"
gCg47n_TlFc,horseradish
gCg47n_TlFc,Guess what - and I'm surprised the geeks didn't/don't get this - we're tracking all the guys who double and triple gigging - and that's the garbage we are taking out.
gCg47n_TlFc,"Hey Alex, I don’t know if you’ll come back and see this, and I’m not usually one that comments. But, I’ve been strongly considering working towards becoming a data analyst from a different career. You talking about your family and wanting to provide for them and support them as your number one is what truly resonates with me. I agree wholeheartedly that money is great, but true joy in this life comes from the relationships that we form and nurture. I wish you the best with your growing brand! I appreciate you sharing your wisdom and your humility by not really asking for much in return other than a listener. Blessings!"
gCg47n_TlFc,"Thank you for the video and your perspective! Do you have conflict of interest here? because I would rather say that conclusion you made is overly optimistic towards people who entering or is going to enter the field. I think that senior engineers won't be affected too much because there is a strong demand for good senior level engineers. Mid-level would be probably more affected, but I suppose new grads and switchers will be mostly affected, because they will be competing with people with few years of experience. Why would company ever considered entering level applicants if the company received some amount of applications from people with a few years of experience?"
gCg47n_TlFc,Hi Alex - would you do an updated version of this especially with all the Tech layoffs happening in Nov 2022 - thanks
gCg47n_TlFc,"Horse radish doesn't even sound real Alex!

Loved the ending of the video, as Always"
gCg47n_TlFc,Work remotely and keep multiple jobs.
gCg47n_TlFc,"The ASMR was weird indeed. 🤣 But great video as usual, it was nice to listen while at work!"
gCg47n_TlFc,"They cancelled my Spotify internship for software engineering :C

But I'll keep at it!"
gCg47n_TlFc,In india they blame PM Modi for inflation
gCg47n_TlFc,Are you Italian descent anyway? You sound much like Rafael Di Furia from Globe Trotter channel.
gCg47n_TlFc,"Working remote saves so much money in so many different ways like gas, food, clothes/work clothes. It also saves your mental state by being able to work comfortably in your own home so you can watch your kids and take care of other family needs"
gCg47n_TlFc,"Maybe I don't quite understand, but if a whole bunch of people are resigning then why would there be a problem with the hiring freeze and layoffs?"
gCg47n_TlFc,The last several minutes of the video was amazing. I hope to get to that point in my life some time.
gCg47n_TlFc,"I think your analysis is not very accurate, all data shows that senior tech employees are bouncing back to employment faster (if they want), what companies are stopping now is new projects, which historically are those who would bring newcomers to the space, and this is unlikely to change."
gCg47n_TlFc,"I have a small tech company and we have worked remote ever since coronavirus. I understand the employee position but theres also something you are not seeing as employees. While a lot of employees can perform remotely not every employee can perform remotely. I have employees who lower their performance ever since working remotely. People say, well fire them ! but its not easy because its not easy to replace them and they now it. i have always treated my employees with respect and dignity and treated them fairly, during coronavirus i did not fire ANY employee at all and even when had 0 income for months and months i only lowered their salary for about 4 months or so and after that full salary again. But what they did in exchange? They became less loyal actually, having more than one job and underperforming. I have eventually managed to keep the good ones but my point is, NOT EVERY COMPANY is evil and yet we are all getting treated like we are to blame for the employees misery. I just think theres always going to be people whi will do the least effort possible and trick the system if not supervised and theres also tech  projects which are not all software based. Who will you work in Research and development of new materials, batteries etc etc from home ? There are many tech areas where you NEED to be at the office or else there wont be any breakthroughs or real testing."
gCg47n_TlFc,"I was with a company for 6 years, eventually becoming the VP. I was making great $ then a joint venture didn't go through and my project was cancelled. That Friday, Jul 1, (4th of July weekend) I got the call. No severance or heads up. So that Monday I started refreshing my memory of SQL and started learning Power BI. 

I have an MIS degree which is not the same as a computer science degree so I was having a hard time being selected for interviews since I wasn't fluent in programming languages. I found your channel sometime during my second week of my layoff, and started looking into business analyst roles. I was a sales person that worked his way up to the VP. I never had a business analyst job but of course I had done a lot of analysis type of work.

Anyways long story short, today I was offered my first Business/Data Analyst role with the vision of creating a data analysis department. I couldn't be happier! Thank you!"
gCg47n_TlFc,Cult leader Alex came out at the end 🤣
gCg47n_TlFc,I'm so not surprised that horseradish is a vegetable. But it's a veggie...no?
gCg47n_TlFc,Alex feeling himself at 39:30 😂😂😂
gCg47n_TlFc,"The final 8mins was my best part of this video....while we're worried about getting a better job and growth somethings are more important e.g family and it can be a delimiter to that growth we seek, it could positive or otherwise"
gCg47n_TlFc,"What if you are looking to attend grad school for a data discipline, and they have a booster mandate, even for students who are remote 99% of the time? You want to go there to learn about data, and you see the institution is not following the data...because the donors and parents who fund them aren't. How do you reconcile that? What's the point of learning about data and analysis if you are just faking reality, so to speak?"
gCg47n_TlFc,"All of this below conversation makes me think of another very controversial issue. As a data professional, how ""political"" is your job? How much does the management's ideology affect how you present the data? How does your own ideology affect how you present the data? Were you ever asked to sort of ""cook"" the numbers or misrepresent them, as we see the Biden administration do on social media every day? C'mon peeps, if you are basically numerate, and you understand data, you see what is happening. Or, maybe you don't. Maybe you are naive or not numerate, just use Python and SQL and don't understand anything about how the world operates, either. Not everyone majored in math, econ, public policy, etc. Maybe they don't know what the hell they're doing in the data world."
gCg47n_TlFc,"Dear Alex,

I am interested in expanding my knowledge to data analytics and perhaps making a career change from Finance. Your videos have played a major part in that.

I would like to know if data analysts have a good career path for individual contributors (i.e. people who don't want to be team leaders and managers) like developers do or the ""ceiling is too low"" if you don't take the management route.

Many thanks,
Kostis"
gCg47n_TlFc,I just graduated in May and we are really struggling here.
gCg47n_TlFc,"Hi alex, PLEASE reply. 
I’ve degree in Applied Mathematics and have 8 years of teaching experience at high school level. I’m starting to learn data analytics and  I’ve been watching a lot of videos for the past few days on data analytics and unable to find information about people from other countries other than US, I’m from Pakistan and here we don’t have enough opportunities for data analysts and my question is, do companies from US, UK or Canada hire entry level analysts from countries like Pakistan? 
Also, at 31 years of age would I be able to get a job? I know it’s very early to ask such questions but I don’t want to go down the path where I’ve no future. Thanks!"
gCg47n_TlFc,"I've had a YouTube account for over a decade and have never commented...ever. Anyway, I wanted to say thank you for your content and your beautiful spirit. Family is everything and your's is fortunate to have you. These times feel strange, but I think I needed to hear everything that you talked about on this video, including all the content at the end. Thank you again. I can come away from this video feeling less alone, less weird, appreciating my beautiful family, and knowing deep down that all is not lost."
gCg47n_TlFc,The market downturn started prior to the Russian Ukrainian war. Investors were trying to price in the upcoming rate hikes and QT that the fed was going to start in 2022. The market started declining late December early January. Russia invade the end of Feb. It is a good excuse for many political leaders to just blame Russia but it was quite obvious back in December that the bubble was going to pop in 2022 regardless. Even crypto started to decline in November 2021.
gCg47n_TlFc,This hiring freeze is jeopardizing my google job application which was in the final final stages :(
gCg47n_TlFc,My son just turned 3 and we started sending him to daycare. First week was rough and now we are on week two and today was the first time he didn’t look back when I said “have a nice day!”. Caught me off guard haha. But this week seeing him excited to see me during pick up and being excited about drop off has been extremely emotional as well! It’s amazing to see them grow and be giddy but then you also want it to stay like this forever 🥹. Transitioning careers for that same reason: can’t prioritize work over family. Been having a hard time but I plan to take some courses to give myself a competitive edge soon!
gCg47n_TlFc,Would love to set up a 1 on 1 with you Alex. I checked your patreon and it looks like the packages are sold out. Any chance I could shoot you an email for career advice?
gCg47n_TlFc,"Ah yes, the PLANdemic, AKA the ""event"" youtube economist have been warning about since 2015, AKA the excuse for the many suffering and the few prospering, AKA the results of the government taking bribes and jumping into bed with the corporations. Ugh, come on, WAKE UP!!!!"
gCg47n_TlFc,Hi Alex I didn't know Horseradish was a veggie. I like it on mashed potatoes
gCg47n_TlFc,"Just to get it clear, the world economy got screwed by sanctions imposed by the politicians that thought Russia is nothing but a minor gas station. So why is it Putin and not Biden?"
gCg47n_TlFc,A little bit of luck never hurts. Great vid Sir. Thank you

gCg47n_TlFc,"Horseradish browns with medium done meat, 👌
Edit* 
I had written a two paragraph comment yesterday about how I could relate my thoughts with you for some reason it did not go through. 😟
Anyway just wanted to inform you that I completed The Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate
Be that light at the end of the tunnel, the world needs more people like you, Alex 🙏
Thanks you for the valuable information and keeping the positive vibes! 😊"
gCg47n_TlFc,Pls how can I be an analyst from zero to hero
gCg47n_TlFc,"I used to work at PayPal and I got laid off a few weeks ago along with hundreds others. It sucked, but thankfully I've bounced back and started another job."
gCg47n_TlFc,I enjoyed hearing your thoughts! Thanks for the great content Alex!
gCg47n_TlFc,"You've practiced seeing your son go to kindergarten 😆. Thanks Alex, family is everything."
gCg47n_TlFc,Family bit at the end actually got me thinking. I've been so ambitious and focused on career growth I should probably start a family soon before it's too late lol
gCg47n_TlFc,Horseradish ! I love adding a bit to my honey roasted ham sandwiches 😆😋😋
gCg47n_TlFc,"Amazing how 65+ folks with pensions and SS/Medicare (which we likely won't have) were able to screw over mid career people w/families just trying to make it so they could feel safe going out in public. It's very scary to go places here and see everyone masked on a 90+ degree day, and new plexiglass going up in your local grocery store chain and stores like Ulta in summer 2022. They're planning for forever COVID..."
gCg47n_TlFc,"I think many of the resignations were due to people refusing to put an experimental medical device in one's body to have a lower impact of coronavirus, which has an over 99% survival rate. If I was working, I would not take the jabs. I am hoping the mandates will be over when I am ready to reenter the work force."
gCg47n_TlFc,"Psst..Putin was only a small part of this. If we're this affected by Putin, it's not all Putin's fault. We've all put ourselves here...Your (naive) political ideology is showing. Love your channel, though."
gCg47n_TlFc,"Hi Alex, thanks for your informative, helpful videos and this discussion on these trying times! I'm trying to become an analyst as a recent graduate (MS in Applied Math), and I just wanted to share an experience I had around 4 months ago:

I was referred to a relatively large (at the time, $20B market cap) tech company by a friend. I excitedly interviewed, did quite well, and waited to hear back. Six days passed, and each day their stock price was getting demolished.

On the seventh day since my interview, I received an email saying the position was already filled--""Thanks for your interest!"". My friend, despite being told to tell no one, mentions to me that I did not receive a subsequent interview because the position was actually removed due to the company's recent performance (valued then at $7B).

Yours truly,
--An entry level new grad great resignation aftermath data point."
gCg47n_TlFc,"Even though I 'shored up' my resume by taking a Tableau Analytics course through Emory University when my job got outsourced in September of 2021, I haven't been able to buy a job!  Every 'entry' level position wants you to have a BS in Engineering, Computer Science, Economics, etc. preferably a Masters, know Tableau AND Power BI (expert in DAX), along with Python AND R, SAS (or some other statistical package), Snowflake, data modeling, data warehouse, data lakes and whatever industry proprietary package--all of this with 2 to 5 years experience.  Oh, and you need to be able to do regression modeling as well.  All I'm thinking is ""this unicorn already has a job and if they don't, they're not looking for an 'entry' level position"".  It really has gotten completely out of control with what these companies 'expect' out of an entry level candidate to the point where people like me (someone who knew SQL, Alteryx, Pivot Tables (regular and Power) and Power Query BEFORE I took Tableau Analytics) can't smell a job and yes I'm on linkedin.  No one told me I needed a portfolio so I'm working on that, but I still can't find a job.

As far as people working from home, I come from the Coca-Cola family of companies and worked on their campus.  I get why they want people to come in a couple of times a week.  Home Depot requires that most of their employees come into the office a couple of times a week. If you think about it, a lot of people eventually lost their jobs and can't find work because corporate workers began to telecommute 5 days a week.  The people who work in the cafeteria, the custodial company lost their contract and had to let their crews go, a lot of the security people lost their jobs, the media specialists who ran the town hall meetings got laid off, the receptionists around the campus, the data quality people who ran product-testing, the maintenance people who are now down to the bare bone and on and on and on.  You could make the argument that they should've gone to college and learned blah, blah, blah, but we were glad they were there when we came into the office a couple of times a week. 

I guess what I'm saying is that, the world doesn't just revolve around people who can work from home.  Other people can also be negatively affected by those choices, none of which helps the economy."
gCg47n_TlFc,Geopolitical commentary and “I stand with the people”…I like it! Picasso👌
gCg47n_TlFc,"Being originally from Texas,  I like saying HORSERADISH as a swear alternative instead of HORSE-SH*T or BULL SH*T.   🤣
I.E.  These tech layoffs and hiring freezes are a bunch of horseradish."
gCg47n_TlFc,"My opinion is that healthcare tech lags behind tech in other industries, but healthcare was one of the more secure industries to be employed in during the last recession back in 2008.  At the moment, I feel pretty secure working in healthcare analytics."
gCg47n_TlFc,Thank you for being FOR THE PEOPLE
gCg47n_TlFc,"Here's the thing about the ""Great Resignation,"" there isn’t a one size fits all reason for why people resign/ed. But, to be honest, people got to a point where they re-thought their philosophy on work, and for the first time in my lifetime, companies have finally been forced to revisit this out of necessity. For once, companies have had a hard time filling positions and were forced to address pay, time off, quality of life, work/life balance, etc. It's about effing time. You cited a whole host of excellent reasons for which this was necessary. We spend such a disproportionate % of our lives at work. Shouldn't it be livable? And, should we really have to adjust every aspect of our lives around work? I'm not saying work should be 2000% unicorns and rainbows but in many workplaces it's been the polar opposite until now and that could be the reason for the outsized response."
gCg47n_TlFc,Waiting your PowerBI Project Video.
gCg47n_TlFc,Looking at internships being rescinded and the layoffs
gCg47n_TlFc,Hey bro you okay? arount the 40 min mark
gCg47n_TlFc,"Hi Alex, thanks for the video.  Your mic/sound is going in and out weirdly just heads up.  Sounds like you're floating in and out of the room I'm listening in."
gCg47n_TlFc,This is very serious . Entry level guys we are struggling.
gCg47n_TlFc,We have entry level jobs requiring 3 yrs of exp but somehow there are 2 jobs for every 1 job seeker.  2008 me sees 2022 me and wonders how'd we get into the upside down again.
gCg47n_TlFc,Now we know amost everything lol
gCg47n_TlFc,I love using horseradish while making pot roast in an instant pot!
gCg47n_TlFc,You’re the man Alex
gCg47n_TlFc,And people try to blame the worker... How about companies start to actually hire and train the mass amount of people interested in being employed in tech... This is how you actually prevent a recession.
gCg47n_TlFc,"These lay offs don't really matter because there are other tech companies willing to pick up the laid off employees. Tech is doing great overall, FAANG giants are just doing bad because their senior staff all left. Current leadership thinks new hires can replace the old but that's simply not how things work in this industry. The giants have hundreds of new hires just sitting on the bench getting paid to do nothing. I know because I'm one of them.

After they do these mass layoffs they're going to find that the quit rate remains elevated, they're going to quickly lack bodies again, and they're going to wind up right back in the same position.

Literally the only way out is adequate training and increased compensation and nothing will change the pace of the great resignation until those are given."
gCg47n_TlFc,"alex you legend, keep doing what you do, you helped me land a job this year, thanks to you, we are stronger together!"
gCg47n_TlFc,"Putin isn't #1 bad guy - it is shits his pants Biden and his economic policies - nice try soyboy. The Xiden Administration is a literally a clown show. Unbelievable how your are blind to what Xiden is doing to this country. You shouldn't hide the 1984 woke ""cultural mandate"" being shoved down the throats in the workplace as another big reason for folks resigning. Unsubscribing"
gCg47n_TlFc,"This whole situation still has me hopeful about finding a job at the entry-level.
Just a little more competitive at the moment.

Edit: it's always fine to rant to us. I enjoy your stories every time. And yes, family always comes first too 💯"
gCg47n_TlFc,"I didn’t know horseradish was a vegetable. When I first moved to the US, I put a ton of horseradish mustard in my food… let’s just say that was a very memorable surprise! Lol"
gCg47n_TlFc,Always so informative watching you!
gCg47n_TlFc,Horseradish is a veggie?! Now I can tell my trainer I sometimes have a healthy meal 😂😂.
gCg47n_TlFc,do your research Putin's not the bad guy in this situation it's Nato expansion since WWII and the US backing of Ukraine. don't be blinded by corporate media.  watch channels like Jimmy Dore show and Democracy at Work to find the truth. Also watch videos on political analyst John Mearsheimer.  he explains it best what caused Putin to invade Ukraine.
gCg47n_TlFc,I played the video to hear your take on the Great Resignation.... I stayed for the family talk. You are an extraordinary parent. I wish as adults we'd embrace that pure innocent joy of you 3 year old son.  It made me reflect on  the things that still make me feel that unfiltered joy and how wonderful it is!Thank you Alex! 😊❤
gCg47n_TlFc,"Always glad to watch your videos Alex!

Yes, the layoffs and current corporate trend has been crazy for sure. I'm glad I choose a company that not only allows flexible work but also provides additional employee benefits such as regular mental health wellness & healthy lifestyle programs. Imo, this is much better than companies that offer really high salary but have, quite honestly, unreasonably strict work policies.

Really happy to hear that you and your family are doing great! Sharing these experiences is very touching and would love to see more in future videos :)

P.S. horseradish and ranch sauce works incredibly well with grill for sure 😋"
gCg47n_TlFc,I really like Horseradish. I did know it’s a vegetable but I don’t think I’ve ever seen it in a store outside of condiment form.
gCg47n_TlFc,Horseradish
gCg47n_TlFc,You were talking to me. We're connected. Lol
gCg47n_TlFc,"I normally don't post such early on with a video of yours recently posted.  Good insight and perspective addressed.  I am currently looking for employment. Torn between help desk or data analyst roles.  I am leaning more into data analyst because U can go into more different areas. Versus help desk while I would be good at it I feel I would be stuck in a rut I can't get out of.  Not interested in work ruts to get into at this stage in my life in my 40s.  I do like both but know data roles are more diverse with greater opportunities. Soo Thankful for channels like yours and others on diverse education to learn on DA and going beyond videos to learn those skillsets.

I appreciate listening to your personal quality of life stuff. It reminds me a lot of when I listened to Chris Cuomo's show on Sirius XM up until late last year.  It was the same way where U got the hard reality info stuff first.  Then in between U get all into the personal stuff to wrap it all up in a bow. Just like with Chris it actually humanizes you and gives you balance.  So please continue that. 😃"
gCg47n_TlFc,Good video and an excellent topic .. Good explanation of the scenerio ..
gCg47n_TlFc,"Pre-2020 me: “I don’t get how ‘May you live in interesting times’ was an insult.”
Me now: “Oh, that’s how.”"
gCg47n_TlFc,Russia is responsible for the entire recession.. Vladimir Putin must be held accountable...
gCg47n_TlFc,"Sooo… Does anyone in these comments know a company that would take a chance on a plucky, recent DS grad?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,thanks for the relationship advice
sW5LoDA1ssM,done 35/84
sW5LoDA1ssM,"just an FYI, if the report view that we created doesn't work please make sure that the relationship between the tables in the model view are solid line meaning when you double click the relationship under edit relationship please make sure under cardinality that the Make this Relationship Active is ticked else it would not work as intended."
sW5LoDA1ssM,Done
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Thanks, Alex."
sW5LoDA1ssM,🤲🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏😊💐
sW5LoDA1ssM,"im abit confused, figuring it out, thanks :)"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"""Apocalypse"" 👀"
sW5LoDA1ssM,
sW5LoDA1ssM,"""there already a relationship between these two columns"" Why is this happening for me but not in the video HELP PLEASE"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"If you're getting stuck at 4:45 because the customer information isn't showing on the from table you have to basically deselect customer information on the to table by choosing apocalypse store on the to table and then customer information will become an available option in the from table. 
Also make sure the make this relationship active box is changed or it won't update in the table when you go back to check. 
Mine was unchecked initially"
sW5LoDA1ssM,I'm looking to transfer laterally within the company. A data analyst position just opened up and I will be applying to it. Time to binge some Alex videos!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hi Alex, I am just now really starting to go through this, and the third video will be my next one. It seems like (early on at least) you are not keeping/building off the previous video and are starting fresh each time with each topic within Power BI. Am I correct? I keep wanting to save it before I close the Power BI desktop after stepping away. Please confirm if I am correct."
sW5LoDA1ssM,Thanks for the video! Why does the cross filter matter in this case? Could you please explain? Thank you!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hi Alex, thank you for providing this Power BI tutorials.  On this tutorial number 3, at video stamp 4:24, when clicking the dropdown arrow on the top table, it's not displaying the table 'Customer Information' to select.  It's only showing 'Apocolypse Sales' and 'Apocolypse Store'.    And on the bottom table, it's only showing two tables as well ----- the 'Customer Information' and 'Apocolypse Store'.  I'm not sure why both the top and bottom tables are only displaying two tables, instead of three.  Your input is very much appreciated so I could proceed with your tutorials.  Thank you!"
sW5LoDA1ssM,I still didn't understand when to use which. And what about when we have months?
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Thx for the video

I have a question:
How to connect a table Column with Header names in a second column?

Imagine the first is 10 stocks names with some attributes, each Row being 1 stock, the Ticker Name in the first Column
The second table is a Time series with the historical price of each ticker (Ticker name in the Columns) and first column for the Dates.

any ideas?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"4:08 what do you mean ""Cust information has a very few Rows"" ? it has the same rows 3 by 3 with Apocalypse Sales Table"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"""Today we will be looking at building relationships"". Me: watching it in February 14"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Thanks for the tutorial Alex!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"This one was a bit challenging as a beginner,, but I'll come back again tomorrow 😅"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"@alex In the new update, it doesnt let you flip the relationship like you did. FYI"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Hi Alex - at 6:09 your total is 10. I did same thing and got a total of 74. I crossed checked with the data i  excel and saw we had a total of 74 products sold. Please can you help clarify that ?Thank you so much Alex.
sW5LoDA1ssM,Great Video Mosh !!!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Can you explain more about the cross filter direction --> in other practice videos I've watched, you don't add the both direction. When do you need to adjust this?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Nuhun pak Alex 🙏🙏
sW5LoDA1ssM,"I have a question, when I am manually dragging the data I want to make connections it does not allow me. I have double checked the properties as that’s what it said online but I’m still unable to make the connection I want to"
sW5LoDA1ssM,❤❤❤
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hi - at 6:09 your total is 10 but this does not match the consolidated figure for all the states. Can you please explain why, thank you."
sW5LoDA1ssM,Love you bro you are great you soved my problem that i faced for a long time
sW5LoDA1ssM,"It would have been better if you'd explained when to use Single and when to use Both for cross-filter direction. In fact, I don't even know what ""cross-filter"" means?!"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"For anyone who is still getting the 10,10,10,10 in the states and measures, make sure that you select ""Make this relationship active"", just under the cardinality drop down."
sW5LoDA1ssM,thanks man.
sW5LoDA1ssM,Not sure how the customer to sales can me many:many.  It has to be 1:many.  One Customer can have multiple purchase IDs but a purchase ID can have only one Customer ID.
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Thankyouuu, this video is really helpful"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"When I created a relationship it gave an error when I tried to change from one to many , to many to one. 
""Column 'Must ID"" in Table 'Apocalypse Sales' contains a duplicate value '1234' and this is not allowed for columns on the side of many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of table.
Please explain !"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Amazing short and useful
sW5LoDA1ssM,Big w
sW5LoDA1ssM,Is there a reason why the output against each store still shows 10 for me even when I change the cross-filter to both like Alex did?
sW5LoDA1ssM,This helps. I feel like I need a tutorial that is one level lower than this to understand the both to many and cardinally concept for KPI generation.
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Thank you, Alex. 

I am just going through the videos but having difficulty downloading the datasets.

Any idea on how else to go about it?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Thanks!
sW5LoDA1ssM,Wheres the Excel for this tutorial?
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hi Alex, thank you for providing this Power BI tutorials.

I'm not sure why both the top and bottom tables are only displaying two tables, instead of three.  Your input is very much appreciated so I could proceed with your tutorials.  Thank you!"
sW5LoDA1ssM,What is really the function of the work of this relationship. I don't really know the use
sW5LoDA1ssM,Sit while creating the Relationship i m not having save option for relationship ... And after using another method of dragging and dropping still it is not working the relationship is not created .please help me sir
sW5LoDA1ssM,"The Model Tutorial file was renamed to Bins Lists Tutorial, if anyone is curious"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Great videos, like how compact and simple you make it. Thanks"
sW5LoDA1ssM,the measure wont work i just only get blank on states  and all result are 10
sW5LoDA1ssM,Good video.
sW5LoDA1ssM,why is total not 74 ?
sW5LoDA1ssM,"I didn't understand where to use single relation , I felt that I have always to make it both
Thank Mr."
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Following your YT channel and part of the Analyst Builder community. Thank you for all of your knowledge spilled out to others to make us better. I did have a question at the 7:45 mark. When it comes to the cross filter direction, should it always be listed as both for any relationship? Or is it specific to what the needs are of the data?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"I don't get the single or both arrow meaning in the relationship sir, please explain anyone"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Amazing! Thank you
sW5LoDA1ssM,<3 PERFECT!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hey Alex, would you know if it’s possible to have multiple active relationships for the same variable?
My case is as follows: I have a SF object called projects which represent a business deal. The project has fields for multiple participants, such as buyer’s attorney and seller’s attorney which can be populated with an “organization” object. I’m trying to create a table that shows the 7 participant types across a project where I can use a single slicer and type in a single name (ex: XYZ Law Firm) and I can see all the projects they’re associated with regardless of role. 
How could I set these relationships up? Also, the results in the columns currently only show the SF ID value of the org, not the name"
sW5LoDA1ssM,You explained so well cardinality and many to one.  Thank you !
sW5LoDA1ssM,Liked and Subscribed. Thank you.
sW5LoDA1ssM,no video connecting through SQL Server
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Thanks Alex, for making so easy and straight to the point."
sW5LoDA1ssM,Hi Alex I have same heading names in different tables but when I load the data it is not exactly showing relation and if I try to relate it then I’m only able to do many to many can you please clarify what could be reason for it
sW5LoDA1ssM,Great video. 🎉
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hello. I think there is a confusion on the counting part because if we want to find how many product is sold by state, we should look sale and customer table. If im wrong please aware me"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Instructions Unclear now I am sleeping on the couch.
sW5LoDA1ssM,Argh!!! You already have the relationships build 😑
sW5LoDA1ssM,Not Understood fully this third video.
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Not helpful,  your relationship works fine not notes or warning, whenever I do something it says warning or get hell outta here"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"hello, when you did the relationship in both. then in the table we had a total of 10. what this total value means ?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,yea thanks for the relationship advice!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"I'm really enjoying your Power BI series! As always, THANK YOU!!"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"So if you have more then two tables and you want them all to be connected, choose for both in the crossfilter direction?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"I have a question, why is the total like 10? For both times what is that total actually? Regardless of change both times it shows 10? If its a count total then surely the total of all states is not 10 is it?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,I didn't get this sorry
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hi Alex, please guide to install power bi for mac machine"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Dear Alex,

Thanks for all you do, I really appreciate all the tutorials you put in here.

This is just to notify you that I have been finding it difficult to download the dataset. I have tried all means but it is still the same, but it wasn't like this before.

Kindly help look into it.

Thank you.Regards."
sW5LoDA1ssM,are we using different data sets every video? seems vague when working with different data sets every time. i feel like we didnt even do much with the previous data sets and now we are using another one. i wish we can use the same data sets from start to finish.
sW5LoDA1ssM,"hey Alex, thanks for the tutorial. I was thinking about the Single Cross Filter Direction, but I cound't find a reason to have it. is there a reason for having Single Direction? I feel like it should always be both"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"So, this basically how you do left/right joins in data."
sW5LoDA1ssM,not able to download excel file for analysis please help asap
sW5LoDA1ssM,"As a beginner, I think this video is a little bit harder than other tutorials (SQL, Tableau)"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Cool, it is quite like those Entity Relationship diagrams."
sW5LoDA1ssM,Very easy to understand.  Great Job!
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Was a little confused about the files (Customer Information Apocalypse Sale, and Apocalypses Store)  being out of order like in the video (I say this bc I had issues updating the cardinality like he showed) but I pushed along by the end of it."
sW5LoDA1ssM,Thanks a ton for these Alex!
sW5LoDA1ssM,Hey can anyone help me why when i change my models its not reflecting in my reports?
sW5LoDA1ssM,6:13 but whats up with the total being wrong?
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Going over, your Power BI tutorials for beginners, I love them"
sW5LoDA1ssM,another great video Alex love you babe
sW5LoDA1ssM,"LIKE WHOEVER WATCH THIS BOOT CAMP ANG GET HIRED OR PLACED IN COMPANY OR GET THEIR FIRST INTERNSHIP
AGAIN ALL THANKS TO @Alex The Analyst"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Others say you should avoid bidirectional relationships - so what would you advise a beginner?
sW5LoDA1ssM,Really enjoying your videos. Makes it so much easier. Thank you
sW5LoDA1ssM,table result  not showing when  i chosse cross filter  direction to both..my state become invisible and product id shows 10 rows  single column.. any idea?.. after manual creating the relationship it works..
sW5LoDA1ssM,How is managing these relationships useful for creating a visualization?
sW5LoDA1ssM,"What's the point of the single cross filter direction setup, if both gives you more accurate data?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Hi Alex, thank you for this IB educational videos. Please, explain the logic behind 'Make this relationship active'. I didn't quite get it. 🙂"
sW5LoDA1ssM,Thanks 😊
sW5LoDA1ssM,"Can anyone explain to me why we set the filter to ""both"" and why that changed the count?"
sW5LoDA1ssM,I'm not sure to understand the difference between both and single.. Ive been using single in so many PowerBI projects and I never had any issues with my data ! I am wondering what I am missing lol
sW5LoDA1ssM,"So perfect! Helped me realize why my page-level filters were not working. Had to change from ""single"" to ""both"" directions. Thank you!"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Dude, what are you doing  with your vocals , it makes the whole  listening experience bad"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"I just finished week one of this course. There is definitely some math! If you're like me and its been a minute since you've really had to work through an equation, I would advise just slowing down and making sure you understand what you're looking at before moving on because each step builds on the last. 

Andrew Ng is a very good teacher, which is what makes the class work. ChatGPT is also good as an echo chamber. Try to explain the math to it, it will correct you if you get something wrong."
4nsdARJGzJ0,Are all the video recordings in the updated course also new?
4nsdARJGzJ0,what about the python and its libraries? do they teach these?
4nsdARJGzJ0,does this teach python as well ?
4nsdARJGzJ0,What are the differences to Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng?
4nsdARJGzJ0,You have convinced me to take the course 😅. I paid the $48 let's see how it goes
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hey Alex,
Thanks for the review! Does this course come with a note? (e.g., a pdf or Jyputer notebook)."
4nsdARJGzJ0,No slides are provided?
4nsdARJGzJ0,Not a fan that this is sponsored by coursera. How can anyone be objective in that case
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Looking at mey seen .

4nsdARJGzJ0,"Thanks for sharing this you are a great teacher 
My teacher can i get work after finish this courses ??"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"great efforts in this channel.
I have only simple enquiry as a new sql learner.
I haven't made my mind yet whether to use sql server or not. 
Is sql server the best solution available for those who want to manage and automate databases inside a medium size company.
Is there any alternative i need to consider right from the beginning or any applications that is relevant to integrate with the database being used.
I consider myself a machine learning enthusiast and and would mostly like to automate business solutions with the engine being used.
Thanks for taking time to read this.. God bless you."
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hi Alex and everyone, 
Pls I need help on how to upload my certificate from Coursera to Upwork. I've tried but Coursera is not among the list of options in the certification. Thank you all"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hi Alex are you related to the guy who runs ""chart explorer"" YouTube channel. It's about Data Analytics and you guys look like twins!"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Off topic question. Please answer. How important is it to know statistics for data analyst. And if it is very important what would you recommend to learn? STATA, R STUDIO or anything else really. I am just stuck in regression and correlation. I mean I understand how it works but when you have a really big data manual calculation is not the best way. Just wanna know your opinion on this. Thank you"
4nsdARJGzJ0,it reminds me to Joshua Starmer
4nsdARJGzJ0,Hey Alex! I have completed this course 3 months back. Is it worth to take it up again? Although I know R and don’t know Python!
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hi Alex, I really hope that you can see this comment. I really appreaciate all of your amazing works so far. It is really helpful. Can you suggest any kind of other sources like books or podcads to have a mindset in data analytics? Because I struggle with which questions to ask, rather than which tools and how the codes are written. Thank you so much for that, you are such an amazing man!"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hey Alex,
Thank you for the great review! Is this specialization available only in specific regions? The link is not working for me..."

4nsdARJGzJ0,How much money it cost to learn machine learning course from Coursera?
4nsdARJGzJ0,Thanks Alex for a great review as always. Please what's the cost of this program?
4nsdARJGzJ0,Thanks for sharing this! I was looking for a good ML course and this is exactly the suggestion I needed!
4nsdARJGzJ0,So happy my college actually teaches machine learning in the DA program. So interesting.
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Really glad to see this channel branch out into different fields of analytics! ML knowledge is really valuable to have, especially when it is displayed as a portfolio project on a resume 👏"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hey Alex, I just landed a Data Analyst internship for the summer and I am really looking forward to it. Your channel has definitely helped me out. 

I am looking forward to taking this machine learning specialization as well. I’m planning out when to commit the time to study. Work will take up so much of my time in the day!"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"I have a doubt  , since it is called us Deep learning.ai ..is it just all about deep learning ..or it starts from scratch of ML to Deep learning..of should i do someother machine learning course before taking this... please help me"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"I just found your page and I'm in the process of watching all of your videos. I just accepted a position of a administrative analyst and I like it so far, but I can't find much about others in this position. I don't get paid much ($17)but I'm okay with that for now because I'm entry and graduated with a BS in community health in 2020 and went from a screener,to medical records to my current position at the same clinic location. Where should I start to leverage on my new position of administrative analyst. I'm so sorry for the long comment and grammar but I'm searching for a sense of direction I desperately want to take this small opportunity and grow and I'm afraid that I might because stagnant. 2020 really did a number on my confidence in job hunting and how I'm perceived in the market because I was constantly turned down and overlook for things I felt like I was qualified for."
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Thanks for the review
Is the course also useful for ppl who are more into data analytics ?"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Sad that I have to pay for the specialisation because it is not included in my uni's partnership programme with Coursera, but I think the fee will be worth it :) Thanks for reminding us of Andrew Ng using Python for ML, Alex"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Alex, great video as usual.  Question for you, how do you balance work with your studies and side hustle? What's your schedule look like on a weekly basis?  I'm trying to make changes to my weekly habit to be more efficient.  Would love to hear from you. Thank you"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Your content is amazing, I'm doing the google certification right now and I'm looking forward to start my portfolio with some of your tutorials!"
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hey Alex, up to what level of python do you feel is required to take this specialization. Would you suggest to learn some prior math concepts before heading into this course?"
4nsdARJGzJ0,Updated andrew ng is op
4nsdARJGzJ0,"Hi Alex,

Is this one Specialization course enough to learn Machine Learning and dive into a career related to ML?"
4nsdARJGzJ0,So cool
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks again to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video and the great content - sign up for free here: https://morningbrewdaily.com/alextheanalyst
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks for sharing 😂❤
_QvQxm4dptI,Did he switch from marketing to a data analytics course midvideo without saying he’s switched
_QvQxm4dptI,thanks for the video! Could you please give me a hint? I am currently working as a seo specialist and I have a desire to develop further in marketing to eventually come to marketing operations. Is this course going to help me get closer to that goal or should I just take a digital marketing course?
_QvQxm4dptI,please make review about the update since they add 2 course into it with python course
_QvQxm4dptI,Do I need to know about coding to learn this course? I mean what if I have no knowledge right off the bat?
_QvQxm4dptI,They have updated this certificate since your last review. They've added a dedicated SQL and Python course
_QvQxm4dptI,"It seems they updated the course. 
2 new sections were added: 
1. Data Analysis with Spreadsheets and SQL - 25 hours
2. Python Data Analytics - 25 hours

The total time to completion increased to ""7 months at 10 hours a week"""
_QvQxm4dptI,very arrogant and full of personal biases all over it.
_QvQxm4dptI,"Great review & feedback Alex !

I myself am a data analyst who used to be a digital marketer / traditional marketer.

This entire Coursera Specialization is highly geared ONLY ( as Alex already stated) for those wanting to be in the Marketing Analytics space. I’d also like to add a few things:

1. Even if you’re a generic or non marketing analyst, having digital marketing skills is still a good add on or even as a part time / side hustle .

2. For this like me going into Marketing Analytics, this entire specialization gives you a FREE VOUCHER for the META certification exams. 


Good luck everyone 😎🤓."
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hello,
I am from Bangladesh. anyway, I would like to know if I did IBM Data analytics certification then I could pass meta marketing analytics certification exam.
If so I will opt for IBM Data analytics certification.
Please tell me about it"
_QvQxm4dptI,This review was not helpful. It had your personal biases all over it
_QvQxm4dptI,"I really loved the course 3 of this certificate, I absolutely didn't feel any inconvenience about a bit dark background of the instructor, his manner of presenting the material was quite good and the content itself seemed great to me. This course sparked my interest for statistics and motivated me to take an in-depth statistics course. Actually, Google Analytics certificate is missing statistics completely (I'm right now in the last course of it) and in my opinion it is hard to do a thorough and in-depth  analysis of data without the knowledge of statistics. So I would really recommend course 3 to those who have completed Google analytics certificate."
_QvQxm4dptI,Sir can i take this along with the Google data analytics one ? my goal is to become market research analyst.
_QvQxm4dptI,Very helpful video. I took this course as a beginner: https://youtu.be/I-CYSh00PcU and it was really helpful.
_QvQxm4dptI,"hi Alex, can you also please review the Meta database engineer?"
_QvQxm4dptI,Can u plz review my assignments
_QvQxm4dptI,"most of the meta certifications are not yet done, just start on January,"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Alex, what is the difference between IBM's certificate in Data Analysis vs. Data Science?"
_QvQxm4dptI,I’m in marketing should I go for Google or Meta program first?
_QvQxm4dptI,"Yea, the guy (your doppelganger) at 10:05, looks like he's recording his manifesto.  🤷🏾‍♀️🤣🤣"
_QvQxm4dptI,Best for ads
_QvQxm4dptI,Why you do my girl Anke like that lol? Honestly she kept me into it but yeah i feel you man thanks for the vid ✊🏽
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hey Alex, love your content mate! Question, how do you record the screen and talk at the same time? I'm a new youtube and could use some advice :) Would also love to do a video collab with you!"
_QvQxm4dptI,[̲̅p][̲̅r][̲̅o][̲̅m][̲̅o][̲̅s][̲̅m] 💖
_QvQxm4dptI,What about the Meta social media marketing professional certificate? I’m taking it but what do you think about it?
_QvQxm4dptI,"how long does it takes to do this course? and can you do it in a short amount of time? meaning, if it takes like 3 months, can you do it in a few days instead?"
_QvQxm4dptI,Should i go to School for marketing  or just get my knowledge from websites like coursera?
_QvQxm4dptI,New Meta courses here: https://www.coursera.org/meta-professional-certificates
_QvQxm4dptI,"Alex, Meta is launching five new courses this month, one of them is Database Engineer. But to review them need to wait till 2023 as the courses are released bit by bit"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Alex, i did all and passed first five courses. The last one I did not do as the course was NOT launched yet and not worth paying USD49 for continue.

Yeah the data grading really a low blow"
_QvQxm4dptI,This is my first comment on here… I hope you see it😅… What do you think of creating a Discord server for your Data Analyst community maybe potentially help some of your community members build a type of connection in the data world? I know it won’t be easy with your schedule and all but please think about it❤️💯
_QvQxm4dptI,How much time would it take to complete the course with 4-5 hrs everyday? I've already completed google data analytics course.
_QvQxm4dptI,"This was super informative! I graduated college about a year ago with double majors in business analytics and marketing and have been thinking about getting into more marketing analytics type work after working with more general data (and some heavy/advanced financial/accounting data - not my cup of tea) at my current job. I have the data background and general marketing knowledge, but not much experience in specific marketing analytics techniques - that part of this course may be interesting!"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hey, I'm that ""character"" from the 2nd course! 😄 Only watch 7:20 to 9:35 (especially @8:50), the part where it's about me & my part! 

But more seriously, a buddy of mine follows you and I just so happened to check you out via them where I saw this review of the Meta course I helped build! I won't comment too much about the course & your review but I will say I think it's fair coming from a data analyst and there's always room for improvement for the team.

I actually work full-time as a data scientist / machine learning engineer but I teach & help develop technical courses on the side. But I usually go the ""off-camera"" route or do live recordings (I used to be a data science instructor / curriculum developer at a boot camp, Flatiron School, where I would do live lectures). Frankly, it's nice to hear your relatively positive comments on the part I helped build and lead!

I personally try to constantly improve (maybe my ""stage presence"" could be better 😉) but I won't lie and say that it didn't make me feel proud that you generally liked my section 😄 I could easily see creating a whole course from just a couple weeks of the Python section, but of course there are real world restrictions & limitations that come into play in building a full course like this. And I am obviously biased towards my section since it's what most closely what I do in my day-to-day lol

Anyways, thanks for sharing your opinions in this review! I know everyone on the team & I are always looking to improve! I've been wanting to go back and make more explanation YouTube videos on data science, machine learning, and software development so this has personally been helpful!

I couldn't ask for a more honest and independent review from a data analyst! Keep it up!"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hi, thank you for your amazing content. I am following your tutorials. So, far the journey is amazing. But I want to level up difficulty level and skill level. But I am unable to figure out how to do. Can you please make a video or series to demonstrate how actual data analysis projects work in real world organization. Thank you"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hello Alex, can you please make a video on questions which can be ask in an interview from the projects you have created when we put them into our resume"
_QvQxm4dptI,Hi sir Alex! I just been wondering is your tabluea tutorial series is done? Or are we going to see an intermediate series? Thank you sir Alex been a fruitful journey for me since I watched your videos.
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thank you for reviewing this course, I Have question about what courses recommended about finance for data analysis ???
And thank you again 
Have a nice day"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Boy all that negativity and you gave it a 6?  Based on your underwhelmed analysis, you should have given it a 3 or 4.  

Thanks for your review of this course!"
_QvQxm4dptI,Sir now I am pursuing integrated mtech 5 years course specialization in data science now I completed 3rd can you please say how to and how much I need to prepare to get decent job as fresher in data science sector because there are vast number of topics I am very confused like upto how many concepts I need to cover as a fresher to get decent job in data science sector
_QvQxm4dptI,Nice review. Are you done with the google challenges ? Btw I also got the same link upon completion of the course.
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hey Alex, Thanks for the info as always. 
Being from such a large and well-known company I wonder if they will update the course or keep it more META specific."
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hello Alex, i already finished the google data analytics course, what course would you recommend for someone with interest in business abal"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thank you for the review Alex. But I wouldn’t touch anything that comes out of Meta. Their massive corruption and lack of ethics really disvalue the reputation of their “certified exams” and may even hurt your resume. There is a reason why they ditched their Facebook name. Besides, it is better to go for more technical certs offered by actual colleges, better experience and knowledge."
_QvQxm4dptI,The doppelgänger comment !😂😂😂
_QvQxm4dptI,"I started taking the first two courses a few months ago after taking the Google Analytics certification, because I am working in marketing. I found them content to be pretty basic as well, very introductory, I stopped the course and started studying for the Marketing science meta certification by myself (I already have knowledge in statistics, Python and data modeling) by watching the blueprint videos and lectures. I passed at my first attempt, and I can say the most important thing is to understand the basics of Facebook products for data analysis, hypothesis, interpretation of MMM models, conversion and brand lifts."
_QvQxm4dptI,To be honest data camp is better. ❤
_QvQxm4dptI,I liked you comment about the man at the basement 🤣🤣
_QvQxm4dptI,Currently on my first course of the specialization. It isn't something I already don't know but it's a great collection of information considering I am a self learner.
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thanks for the review Alex!

Since I started my journey in the Data Analytics field, I have the feeling that Udemy courses made by ""expert individuals"" are more practical and better suited than those from big universities or companies. 

I am currently half-way the DA Google certifcate and although it is very well explained and the content goes straight to the point, it feels a bit slow and full of  things that in my opinion are important but secondary such as: communication, CV preparation, ethics...
I had another bad experience with a popular Javascript course from Hapwkings University...

Whereas other courses that I took about Python and ML taught by particulars are more focused on the skills. 

I guess we have to balance the possibility to get a valid certification and the actual content we learn. 

Thanks again, love your content!

Carlos.-"
_QvQxm4dptI,"A Facebook data center is 5 miles from where I live, I think this would be nice if it helped people to get hired."
_QvQxm4dptI,"Don’t normally comment but I started watching your videos back in October of 2021. After watching your videos and doing the Google Analytics Certificate I am starting my first tech job as a Jr Data Analyst! So thank you for all your videos and information, it definitely helped me on my career change."
_QvQxm4dptI,I disagree with the part where you said clustering is not related to marketing analytics... A lot of companies do use clustering for customers segmentation before they ads. I am not sure abt the context in this particular course though.
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thanks Alex, this was helpful!"
_QvQxm4dptI,"I agree. It looks pretty basic. As someone learning Python, I wouldn't go for it. 
Also Alex, you can always increase the playspeed of the videos. Saves times.
Finally, I hope those Meta lectures don't come after you for your honesty 😂🤣😂"
_QvQxm4dptI,I took his course and I share the same sentiment about the course being a bit boring and the support for the data analytics course was poor after running into a grading issue
_QvQxm4dptI,hi alex   i come from djibouti and i like   data analyse  and you help me to built hard portoflio   and you give me a confidence to start my journey as data analyste
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hi Alex, if I’m only interested in the marketing data analytics part of the course (I have finished the google data analytics certification, have python and sql knowledge as well). Do you recommend only taking section 4 and skipping the rest?"
_QvQxm4dptI,"I am close to finish the Google Data Analytics professional course, so what's your recommend for this course? Do I need to do this or not necessary?"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Hey Alex, can you make a video on how to practice solving case studies .. It would be great for data nerds and me too"
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thanks for this, Alex! I feel like Marketing Analytics is a hugely underserved domain, considering what a staggering amount of money is involved. 

Also because that's where I work, and it hurts my feelings that more attention is not paid... 🤣

I'm working through the Google Digital Marketing course, which is fascinating but not super Analytics-focused."
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks for keeping it real!
_QvQxm4dptI,Hello Alex good morning. I wanted to ask what subtopics in excel do I need to know to be a data analyst also? Like are we supposed to all the formulas and steps by heart? Please kindly advise. Thanks
_QvQxm4dptI,Thanks for the video Alex - would you say your video on best courses for data analysis from earlier this year is still up to date or would you add any other course there?
_QvQxm4dptI,"Thanks for reviewing this, I have just finished some parts of the Google analytics course so I'm trying to find what to do next. I think the Google course is a little bit basic if you have analytics experience already, although I did learn things from the course that will help make me a more well rounded data analyst.  Great content as always 😊"
HX2TabgkzHo,The link worked for me ... and now i'm on level 2. The first challenge was so easy took me 26m17s. but now stuck on second one . BTW thanks alex for posting this video.
HX2TabgkzHo,Curious...this was 2yrs ago ...what happened after you completed the challenges?
HX2TabgkzHo,😂
HX2TabgkzHo,"Sir please tell me , how to open the puzzle nd solve it ? Because when m opening it nd on a new tab it is showing something else"
HX2TabgkzHo,"Sir Please tell me , m seeing the puzzle right in front of my eyes ...how will i open it ??"
HX2TabgkzHo,"9/10th done with the cert. Making my capstone analysis now, One thing that bothers me. They teach R and then give you a puzzle that cant be solved in R...."
HX2TabgkzHo,I skipped it. Now I'm curious to see if I still have access to it.
HX2TabgkzHo,Great Work. How can I move annotations from Universal to GA4?
HX2TabgkzHo,Hello Alex can you upload the solution of the last problem.
HX2TabgkzHo,"Hey ATA, I recently finished the course and was given the same link, but I haven't started it yet.  I was curious, since this video is now several months old, were you able to fully infiltrate Commander Lambda's organization and stop the LAMBCHOP Doomsday device? 🐇"
HX2TabgkzHo,"Update: I have just finished the course and Google have now added a couple of sentences before the puzzle -> ""We invite you to stretch your skills in a new way. This puzzle isn't part of passing the certificate or getting a job, just a fun way to challenge yourself. "" Lol"
HX2TabgkzHo,So interesting! I completed this cert a week ago and sure enough there it was. Thanks for sharing!
HX2TabgkzHo,Why not use R isn't that what Google teaches for the certification?
HX2TabgkzHo,Jalapenos
HX2TabgkzHo,Upon completion of the 8th course I have also received the link to the challenge ;)
HX2TabgkzHo,"I finished the course and now I’m doing the foobar challenge. I figured out the 2nd problem on paper now I just need to figure out how to code it lol. I am learning a lot as I’m working through it, I wonder if this will help in any way if I apply to google afterwards."
HX2TabgkzHo,"I was just studying about itertools today and suddenly my window bended saying ""It seems you are speaking our language"" and asked to try a game and when I clicked it opened the foobar challenge and I completed my first level which was a very straight forward question which took me 7 minutes to complete. Excited to solve and try my best!"
HX2TabgkzHo,Is this hiring platform open to non US citizens too? The coursera job platform is US only. I don't want to do the challenge and no one even acknowledging it.
HX2TabgkzHo,They teach R in that course. Why is the challenge in python?
HX2TabgkzHo,I am going to start the data analytics course through merit America in 2 weeks and I’ve been looking at data analyst jobs and all of them say bachelors is required.. will it be difficult to find a job in the field with only a google certification?
HX2TabgkzHo,"omfg I should watch the whole video b4 commenting sounds cool. 
edit @:2 mins fk
4mins: that's a good way to get some1 with Python exp lol"
HX2TabgkzHo,Initially freaky... then I became curious.. Interested to see further
HX2TabgkzHo,i just finished the cert saw it and ignored it. Ha!
HX2TabgkzHo,I'm on my way to finishing this course and this video made me wanna finish it faster. 😅
HX2TabgkzHo,"Hi there, great video and really useful! I am considering changing careers and becoming a Data Analyst. I just had a question please - do you think in a few years time the role of a Data Analyst may be able to be completely done by a Data Scientist? Therefore there being less of a need for Data Analysts, as Data Scientists will have the skills to carry out the duties of the Data Analyst role. Thanks in advance"
HX2TabgkzHo,What is f****** wrong with you
HX2TabgkzHo,I took the foobar challenge back in 2017 when I was first learning python. It popped up mysteriously after doing a ridiculous number of Google searches related to python in a short period of time. Stayed up for two days straight and solved the first two and almost the third before running out of time. Learned a lot in the process though!
HX2TabgkzHo,"Y were you hiding in the closet broo?
Spook your viewer's is good idea though 😂"
HX2TabgkzHo,"I figured it out when I was pursuing the GDA course after solving it (badass moment),I searched the web about it .. surprisingly there are thousands of comments stating that they've won the challenge and still they weren't hired😑"
HX2TabgkzHo,I took and completed the google data analytics course but never received this email from them
HX2TabgkzHo,"I've taken the certificate and got to the challenge as well. I'm currently at level 3 - only took the 1st challenge in it up to now and thought it was pretty hard. I had the same persecutory syndrome as you're having haha it's pretty weird how Google actually managed to keep it a secret, mostly."
HX2TabgkzHo,Haha well time for me to pass that certificate 😂
HX2TabgkzHo,To summarize you don't recommend Google data analyst course?
HX2TabgkzHo,I did the certification a while ago... cannot see any binary code now. Does it disappear ?
HX2TabgkzHo,its economy recession  time .. time for find those talented programmers if you as me
HX2TabgkzHo,"CICADA 3301
so original..."
HX2TabgkzHo,What if this mysterious challange/test is leading to something like in the Enders Game movie? Yeah i am watching movies too much lol
HX2TabgkzHo,Pls keep posted that's cool!
HX2TabgkzHo,Just started the google data analytical certification
HX2TabgkzHo,"Hi Alex,  do you have any adivce for a career transition as a freelancer of data analyst (after 20 years served in financial industry) ? Besides for BI tools/SQL/Python, is it necessary to learn argos/data structure and web developement ?"
HX2TabgkzHo,0:45 foobar is not a secret though right?
HX2TabgkzHo,"Very interesting! If you find secret hiring platforms from other big companies, please let us know, lol :)"
HX2TabgkzHo,The best promotion for Coursera ever 😂
HX2TabgkzHo,I got that foobar challenge too a few weeks ago after searching up 'lambda expression'. That's the most common way to prompt the invite apparently. It's just a random challenge that's been deprecated lol no biggie
HX2TabgkzHo,Best intro of the year
HX2TabgkzHo,ALEX! This is very true! I did it but didn't finish because i didn't have time! I completed the first challenge and passed! But I didn't complete the other two because I didn't care about it really! I just thought it was a game! I'm a data engineer and I didn't think much about it! This is very very true!
HX2TabgkzHo,Ive been completed this certificate a while back! It was fun but entry level though!
HX2TabgkzHo,"Wow! Typing the link didn't worked, but I've accesed Coursera and found the binarie code, translated and now I'm in. Amazing!"
HX2TabgkzHo,thanks for sharing this !!!!!!!
HX2TabgkzHo,Loved the X-files background music! 🤣😂
HX2TabgkzHo,When your hiring manager and seeing this thing 🤣🤣🤣
HX2TabgkzHo,You're a g for sharing this alex
HX2TabgkzHo,My Chromebook crashes all the time. Usually it's NBD bc it turns on in 2 seconds and all tabs restore in 2 more
HX2TabgkzHo,"I was thinking for that challenge there are four steps. 
1. Use a for loop and take the ABS of each number. 
2. Sort all numbers from least to greatest
3. Slice the list [0:2] 
4. Multiply the remaining numbers 

All these features are found in numpy unless if that’s not allowed. 

Seems like a lot fun doing these challenges but if I saw that site I be like pass because I would be afraid of someone getting into my computer."
HX2TabgkzHo,"in the first challenge, do we need to create an attribute of solution function ..

because in given tests it is solution.solution() ???

i am getting ryt ans for 1 and 3 but wrong for rest"
HX2TabgkzHo,"I was using google as my search engine and I've been learning lots of coding for the past few months. I stumbled upon that link, the google browser basically asked the same question and then that foobar link appeared. I wasn't able to do anything with it though since I'm a beginner. But it does imply that google knows everything about the activities we do here on the internet."
HX2TabgkzHo,"I got that email after I finished the course a couple weeks ago. And found that url, I tried solving the first one but my python skills are very limited. Might go back and try again though after seeing this!"
HX2TabgkzHo,I remember seeing this when I completed the cert in May!!! I logged back in—after watching your video—and now there's a statement above the binary code essentially saying this puzzle isn't part of passing the cert or getting a job.
HX2TabgkzHo,Just curious why are they giving coding questions.I guess people pursuing this course would barely be able to write a function. Why would a person who knows how to code even go for this course.🙄🧐
HX2TabgkzHo,😂😂😂 I love this new stuff you’re trying out
HX2TabgkzHo,"It doesn’t make sense. I completed google data analytics course 1 year ago but I didn’t get anything like that, plus they don’t teach you Python or Java, why would they challenge you on those languages."
HX2TabgkzHo,"My computer crashed the exact same day! (But not right after tho, it was two hours before I even heard about this) 🤣 I'm freaking out in the closet (but then I'll go do video editing before I post it of course) Here's to blowing up your channel (I'm assuming that's what you're expecting to happen)"
HX2TabgkzHo,I am laughing 😂 and learning 👨‍🎓
HX2TabgkzHo,Oddly enough after watching this I remember having a binary code during one of my first courses. I didn't think anything of it since I was just beginning to learn data analysis.
HX2TabgkzHo,Why your 4 videos are hidden in Power Bi beginners tutorial playlist section?
HX2TabgkzHo,I'd heard a few years ago that you can trigger this with certain coding searches or google's own coding free coruses
HX2TabgkzHo,"Wow…. Waiting for the next video 

Wish you much luck 🍀"
HX2TabgkzHo,"To thinking at the start there was a gun pointing at your head 😂, the puzzle is in python though. I guess its a statement of intent"
HX2TabgkzHo,Alex this is hilariously entertaining and educational at the same time. Well done sir!
HX2TabgkzHo,"When I first started learning python, I was using google a lot and random I got this after a search. Needless to say I didn’t know enough to finish even the first puzzle."
HX2TabgkzHo,This so cool tho
HX2TabgkzHo,End with suspense and now am excited to watch next video 😃
HX2TabgkzHo,"I was so focus in on this video content, It Had me on the edge of my seat!"
HX2TabgkzHo,The first 1 min looked like the opening scene of Breaking Bad. You will overcome this! Alex.
HX2TabgkzHo,You must let this video self destruct after 24 hours 😂
HX2TabgkzHo,"I think google is listening to me
*Uploads video on youtube*"
HX2TabgkzHo,"Just read on reddit, this seems to be discontinued now, some people did get in to Google but when the loopholes were found, the initiative seems to have been discontinued"
HX2TabgkzHo,"Curious as to why the invitation would have appeared in the Analytics Certificate, considering R is taught rather than Python. Pretty cool either way."
HX2TabgkzHo,Pov when i smoke weed the first time
HX2TabgkzHo,"I clicked the link and i was able to sign in, but i cant find any challenge"
HX2TabgkzHo,Hi Alex good luck. I  didn't  receive  anything like this when I completed the program.
HX2TabgkzHo,I honestly can't wait for your completion of the challenges
HX2TabgkzHo,The intro had me spooked😂😂
HX2TabgkzHo,"Alex, do you know any company that has hired a person with the Google Data Analytics certification?"
HX2TabgkzHo,That was so spooky ...the thing with ur laptop
HX2TabgkzHo,BEST OF LUCK SIR 🙏🙏😇😇😇 👍👍👍👍💯💯
HX2TabgkzHo,im shook bro
HX2TabgkzHo,lmaoooo at partially satire.

HX2TabgkzHo,Thought provoking! Thanks for sharing.
HX2TabgkzHo,Damnnnnnn i m just half way through the video and it blew my mind although I had looked it up the day I saw your Instagram story.  Thanks Alex❤️
HX2TabgkzHo,"I have already solved 3 problems, problems are so cryptic and with complex stories, you are left uninterested at some point. I left at 3 lol"
HX2TabgkzHo,Strange.Is it really true??

gP-AxNi6uxo,"great video, thanks Alex"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Well curated, articulated and illustrative. Thank you sir."
gP-AxNi6uxo,How can I get this data set that you use
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hi alex, please share the pivot table and purchase overview sheet, as I'm unable to go further without those sheet"
gP-AxNi6uxo,we love you
gP-AxNi6uxo,YouTube keeps unsubscribing me from you. They hating on me
gP-AxNi6uxo,you should make your mouse cursor bigger and darker. Sometimes I cannot see where you are hovering at.
gP-AxNi6uxo,great video alex!
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Thanks, sir ❤"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"bro this is very well explained , this can't be this easy"
gP-AxNi6uxo,happy 1 m sir
gP-AxNi6uxo,epic
gP-AxNi6uxo,Why to use power qurry when you can do the same by using normal Excel functions??
gP-AxNi6uxo,edit - the excel workbook/file youre looking for is the one called PQ editor tutorial.. the one just called 'apocalypse food prep' is the wrong one which only contains one single page/sheet.
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Excel Sheet is missed other pages , does any one had the correct file please ?"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"very good quality content, thank you"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thank you so much alex.. You are a gem ✌️
gP-AxNi6uxo,Is apocalypse really all you can think of?  Seriously?
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hello, I am having a problem. I cannot do the Count Disctinct value for DATA TYPE ""TEXT"" inside the Transformation Data model. The option for statistics is not accessible for TEXT type data. Available only for Whole number, currency and number. Any solution? Because of the tutorial Im watching, they are not telling me about the solution. Themks!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Good tutorial.
It would be nice to have higher resolution."
gP-AxNi6uxo,Great tool!!! Thank you very much!!! An easy and simple way to start learning about this amazing tool.
gP-AxNi6uxo,Where’s the document to download
gP-AxNi6uxo,very helpful thank you
gP-AxNi6uxo,Great!
gP-AxNi6uxo,i just started the bootcamp and i'm enjoying every bit of it thank you so much alex
gP-AxNi6uxo,The reason you are Alex the Analyst. Thank you
gP-AxNi6uxo,why my powerbi does not recognize the row and columns as it should be ? mine says COLUMN1 instead of sum of rice. how can i fix it so it can be imported correctly?
gP-AxNi6uxo,Great video. Thanks
gP-AxNi6uxo,Really though Power Bi was complex but its not. Great vids!
gP-AxNi6uxo,Only for me Power BI seems so tedious compared to Tableau? Alex could you do the material explaining exactly what are the scenarios in real life that would make you use one over the other?
gP-AxNi6uxo,"For anyone who is confused why the end result is better and how to know that: your end goal should always be to have one column per variable (product, supermarket, date, price) and one row per observation. This is a good practice in Power BI, Python, R etc. Why? Because normally any data can be stored like this, it's universal and simple."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Nice video. Can these data transformation steps be reproduced as you might with a record a macro in excel, or do you need to do them manually each time?"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Good Job sir. Sir, the data set you used in this video is not among the data set. Please how am i going to get this data set you used in this video
Thank You"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Excellent.
gP-AxNi6uxo,"On the second video, how did you come up with the pivot table, it was not there  from the Excel sheet, the excel was just row data."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hello Alex, I have one question. How did you get Purchase Overview table? Tnx!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"I like your approach, you take a messy table an show us step by step how to deal with it! Thanks a lot! I did Power BI course  a few months ago but haven't been using it at all, so this was a great refresher for me."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hello Alex! I have a question when it comes to having ""null"" in the date column, How can I replace it to be blank? Looking forward to your comment."
gP-AxNi6uxo,Алекс видео супер. Учусь по ним.
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for the video, just got one question, if I have like 9 different excel table sheets, how can I generate a power query then and to export into the power BI?"
gP-AxNi6uxo,The video is great like all others that you make. There are store-wise totals in the table in the final product. How would we manage those if it was a real-world scenario?
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thank you for your great teaching . the way you teach is really understandable.  you are a perfect teacher.
gP-AxNi6uxo,I am unable to see the various sheets in the file shown in this video not sure why
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hello,where can I find the excel file that you are working on it in the video?"
gP-AxNi6uxo,How to add a column to data (Excel) and refesh data on Power BI but no change in visual or non-error
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Alex, thank you so much for the video. But what did you do about the error in the attribute column?"
gP-AxNi6uxo,The other columns are not in the downloaded excel
gP-AxNi6uxo,"I took a Power BI certification course a few months ago. It was super dry and brain numbing. But now that I'm following along your Power BI series I can really see the value and fun in using this tool. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hi Alex, thank u for the very useful tutorial. but i have a question. in this video, the first dataset doesn't have ""month"" on the first sheet, how does it appear on pivot table? is there a way to do it? thank u"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Quality content
gP-AxNi6uxo,i am not able to download the file . Please Advice
gP-AxNi6uxo,thank you so much
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Viewers will find your steps EASIER if you CHANGE the SIZE and COLOR of your CURSOR.

gP-AxNi6uxo,"Great video! Good examples, it is very clear explanation"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"You are very good! Thank you, a great refresher video!. Learning big time. Thanks Alex."
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thank you so much for sharing this powerful information.
gP-AxNi6uxo,Can we get access to the data you are using ?
gP-AxNi6uxo,How was the table created in the “purchase overview” tab in the excel worksheet?
gP-AxNi6uxo,"@alex the analyst when I import the excel data to PowerBI, the comma changes to dot and vice versa, i.e. to my regional settings(Germany) any help here"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"I've been learning the basics of power query and power BI. It was great to follow this along and understand it to the level I'm at, imbedding my learning 😊"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"I love this, these tools especially Tableau and Power bi, are reminding me of using Excel, though advanced of course but its awesome because it takes alot of fear out of learning something new for me lol Thank you Alex!!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Super helpful video.
But.... I find the mouse pointer you use hard to find when I'm trying to follow along -- small, white on white with gray outline is hard to see. Maybe you could change the settings -- enlarge it, invert colors, or use yellow highlighted pointer. Just an idea. Thanks!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Amazing!
gP-AxNi6uxo,"the file doesn't contain 3 sheets, only one !! :("
gP-AxNi6uxo,You’re really good! Thanks a lot!
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thanks Alex but how do we treat the null values in the product_cost column? Are we going to remove it or just leave it there?.
gP-AxNi6uxo,Learning big time. Thanks Alex
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hi Thanks, I'm just entering the BI world (after many years of excel/vba) what happens if you get that data every month, you have to do this every month? or the query editor will apply steps when you change the data source? and will it error if something becomes not compatible e.g. someone moves a column or changes datatype in the excel template"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Great video, thanks.  You did misspell apocalypse but it's not the end of the world."
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thank you !!
gP-AxNi6uxo,Done
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hi Alex, 

You create great helpful content! 
I need your suggestion on the following situation.

I maintain an excel of my client's campaign performance on google ads. I wanted to make a dashboard and automate it so that the dashboard keeps updating on a daily basis. 

Can you please suggest how to go about it?

Want to use Tableau."
gP-AxNi6uxo,I can't fine this new file that you use it in this video. could you please help me?
gP-AxNi6uxo,"I used to work with Tableau as BI Analyst but kinda curious about how Power BI differents with Tableau, makes me excited!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Tip for everyone. You can remove a column by right-clicking the column and selecting remove column.
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thanks for sharing your knowledge and effort.
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Can I get link to download this Data, so that I can practice it to arrange it."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hey Alex! Big fan of your work, you've helped me tremendously in my career the past 6 months. Wanted to help you out and mention that you mispelled ""Apocalypse"" btw. There's an 'A' in the middle and not an 'O'. 

Thanks for what you do man! 😊"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Can you explain why using fixed decimal number instead of decimal in your video. I don't understand the difference between them. Thank you.
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Another great video, Alex!!  THANKS!!!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Thanks Alex, one question; I have a dataset and created a dashboard from that dataset, but there was a need to add some columns and rename a few columns in the excel sheet (dataset), when i press the refresh button; the message says there is an error because of adding columns and not matching the names! is there anyone to guide me through how to deal with this issue? thanks."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"You are very good! Thank you, a great refresher video!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hey, I appreciate you and the work you contribute freely to the world. 
Also your audio sounds a little funky, like it's compressed or a noise reduction thing is mucking it up just a bit. Not huge, just thought I'd point it out."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Love the video, waiting for the rest! thank you"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hey Alex, do you think you can make a video doing a project with Power Bi? Thanks!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"7 unavailable videos , Please check it Alex"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Thanks again Alex 😊💯
gP-AxNi6uxo,alex please there are  4 videos are hidden in this playlist
gP-AxNi6uxo,"You should create a video specifically about portfolio projects. What type of projects you should do how to find data for them.
Feel like you talk about portfolio projects a ton within other videos but should make 1 just dedicated to that"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hello Alex. Sorry to ask questions outside the video content.

I have two questions regarding Google Data Analytics:
1. The capstone course requires external data to use, or they provide data to work on it? I am asking this since I cannot access company data and its highly confidential too.

2. The public version of tablue is suffient to use it for the course?

Thanks in advance!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Power Query is such a game changer for Power Bi (and Excel)... once you realize the ""power"" in bringing in data with this tool you'll never look back (For reference, I used to copy and paste excel files into a single excel file... 🤦🏼‍♂ lolz)  
Thanks for sharing this, Alex!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Aaah, this brings back memories of the good old days when I discovered the power of Power BI and Power Query. Even though I've been using them for the past 2 years, I found this content thoroughly enjoyable. Thanks Alex!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Great video! Thanks Alex!
gP-AxNi6uxo,Waiting for this... Thank you so much Alex
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Hi Alex,
Could you please make a video explaining real-life projects that you perform at work? I would like to have rough idea what projects are carried out in the healthcare industry."
gP-AxNi6uxo,"This is one of the things Power BI Desktop beats Tableau Desktop at, the embedded ETL tool Power Query.  Sure there is Tableau Prep for data cleaning, but I believe it is a separate tool.  Nice video Alex!"
gP-AxNi6uxo,"Great tutorial, cheers buddy 👌"
gP-AxNi6uxo,Than you Alex! It is really helpful and I am looking forward to see you in next video !
gP-AxNi6uxo,Been waiting for this ✨ Thank you

KB2CtEDrglY,I'm having issues at 47:17.  I have triple checked to ensure that my syntax is accurate (even copied/pasted from Github to make sure) but there is only one line of data for Bitcoin (one time stamp) despite me running the code above 5x with 5 different time stamps.  All my tables so far are consistently showing the multiple lines of data for each currency but it isn't pulling into this df10 when I attempt to narrow it down to Bitcoin (or any other singular currency).  I tried other crypto currency names and all of them are only showing 1 line of data/1 timestamp.  What could I be doing wrong?
KB2CtEDrglY,"At 44:05 you can also just trim out values instead of copying and renaming them:
df7['percent_change'] = df7['percent_change'].str[-3:]

because frame.append is deprecated; new format is panda.concat. I kept getting an annoying little warning message that I didn't want to show every time the runner was successful.

If you could recommend a platform or just 1 program could you please tell me which one you would recommend and why? it is very overwhelming seeing all these options online, I have also read many reviews of people who did the google cert and didn;t get any luck getting a entry level job as an analyst . I plan on choosing a platform and your videos for practice.  Thank you in advance"
KB2CtEDrglY,Just checking. Will there be a playback version of this video?
KB2CtEDrglY,"Great topic as usual,  waiting..."
KB2CtEDrglY,"Hi Alex
You are doing great job. I would request you to make project on SQL and power bi (complex one, big dataset and multiple tables)"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"I love the issue @Alex ran into with the notebook yelling at him for having too great a data rate. So real. Nothing ever goes smoothly (give the Sp*tify or T*cketmaster API a go), and it was nice to see he's human.  Great video!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"thank you so much man, im learning so much from this journey"
2HfSFdPEFRg,I wish that I can view stack overflows web traffic before and after chat gpt.... I know probably a tenth of your knowledge but i was able to create a nd deploy 3 python apps that integrate with api's using strictly chatgpt. if i encountered an error i would just paste it into chat gpt... technology is crazy. I always wanted to be a computer programmer but I chose to be a wireless engineer instead. In hindsight i'm glad that i made my choice because I can't ask chatgpt to automatically create me an ethernet cable lol. I'm in the process of ACTUALLY learning this stuff now but even that process is easier with chatgpt to literally be my teacher and hold my hands and be there to answer all of the questions instantly that it would normally take me hours to find on stack overflow
2HfSFdPEFRg,Hey I am not able to see more than 15 rows
2HfSFdPEFRg,Alex you just have to put 1000 in limit portion above the code (below 'start')
2HfSFdPEFRg,any luck on how to change the iopub data rate in mac?
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Thanks for the video Alex! Since I'm following along the Data Analyst Bootcamp, I recommend putting this before the ""Automating Crypto Website API Pull Using Python | Data Analyst Project"" video that's linked in the description. I had to come out of the playlist to find this video. Hope that helps others!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,Thank you so much
2HfSFdPEFRg,1:54 BTC was so cheap lol
2HfSFdPEFRg,"no, two years ago bitcoin was 28 and I had no idea what the hell is this. Now, I seeing it 100k and I know what the hell is this."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"This is the BEST!! For those facing a 404 error with this API, it's because its deprecated now :( but the same method works for ANY API you wanna work with. I used this method on the weatherstack API and it executed perfectly. THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH ALEX"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hi fellow newbies! If you are just now beginning this tutorial and are struggling to append df to df2, python requires to now use concat instead of append.

So instead of using df = df.append(df2)

You must now use df = pd.concat([df,df2])

Goodluck ya'll and keep up the good work!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hi everyone, anyone using Jupyter Lab and managed to get over the iopub data rate limit error?"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"2024_08_26, Current tutorial works, with some error which needs fixing: IOPub data rate exceeded.
Need help please feel free to drop me a text"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Im stuck at 11:20. When I run pd.json_normalize(data['status']) it just says ""name 'data' is not defined"""
2HfSFdPEFRg,"If you are having the IOPub data rate exceed error here is something I noticed. First, make sure that Jupyter Notebook is updated in the anaconda navigator. Second, run the command that Alex shows inside the Anaconda Powershell Prompt.  Not sure why that specifically works but it works"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Nice video 😀… You had to restart the kernel once you have changed the data rate limit. Just in case anyone does not know, you should restart the kernel after installing a package from the pypi using the pip/pip3."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Someone please help how he increased the data limit, what he mentioned in Anaconda prompt?"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"I know this is old, but I'm getting a ""Missing api key"", even tho I used the same code as the doc, video, and tried different versions. When I test it in postman, it works fine."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"while running the below code, I'm getting a message saying Key error: data
pd.json_normalize(data['data']) 
Would be helpful if someone could point out the solution for this"
2HfSFdPEFRg,favori keltoşum
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hi Alex, I also faced the same problem but I'm not able to solve it since I was using Colab. It would be very helpful if you could help me resolve this issue."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"I surveyed YouTube looking for a practical explanation to this topic, this one is the best ever. I just found what I was looking for after being frustrated and depressed. Thank you so much Alex"
2HfSFdPEFRg,Can we retrieve data from other web site using this code?
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hey Alex,
Firs off, I love your videos! second, I am having a issue. Once I updated the data rate limit, it worked briefly and then my ipykernel could not reconnect. did anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"After increasing the data limit, I just closed everything and opened the notebook again  and it worked fine :) Thank you for your videos!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"I got stucked for about 30 minutes trying to connect it to DataSpell. It worked, now I can leave the tutorial with peace :D Thanks!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"That was like magic, I can't wait to learn all this"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Thank you so much Alex!
this is Super Helpful!
I'm trying to pulling up data using API with python before and I got stuck .
But, thanks for this video. I'm ready for the next step "
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Thank you Alex, I started to believe its not important what you do, most important part is how you do. And I can say, you doing great!  So useful and informative video! Thanks a lot"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Dude I work with anaconda environment and doing that or deploying something is impossible. I think it is because I don't have Python installed on my PC, as I said I use Anaconda, and I installed Python in there."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"I'm a Mac user, and there is no anaconda prompt, I don't know how to do..."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"In the future, can you please use a black/contrast mouse cursor with a bigger size. The white one is really hard to track for those watching on a TV. There are dozens of us."
2HfSFdPEFRg,Next power bi video ???
2HfSFdPEFRg,Please make Python Tutorial video for data analyst
2HfSFdPEFRg,I love how real this video gets when the unexpected error occured. Obviously everyone has encountered something similar and things don’t go as planned! 😂
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Okay, so question here - I was taught to add my importa all to the top of my code, even when I figure out that I’ll need it later on in a project, so that folks can see what I’m using all in one place.

I was shocked 😮 when you added yours below some of your live coding. Do you have a preference or is it not something you think about? I’m asking because I’m trying to learn the best practice - if there is one"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hey Alex, I have been meaning to get my hands dirty with the API and now I feel a bit more confident in testing it out and seeing it for myself. Looking forward to the API Project."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Loved it! I started Youtube recently and I'm still small, but you are one my main inspirations for taking this step. Keep doing what you do!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,Hi Alex I wanted to ask you a question. Can you become a data analyst with just a FinTech degree? And do you recomend getting one if so? Thank you
2HfSFdPEFRg,Hi Alex Sir I actually want to ask very important question about the interview its almost asked in all Data analyst interview. Question is that Interviewer asked that if you have less time and your analysis will take more time so in this case what should you reply to your stakeholder
2HfSFdPEFRg,Cannot wait for next video :)) Love your tutorials
2HfSFdPEFRg,How to write a code that keeps capturing the numbers as they change? With the date of change
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Nice video, thank you! Looking forward to the project video(s) that you mentioned!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,Good training.  Thanks for putting this together.
2HfSFdPEFRg,Very informative Alex! Thank you!
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Good video, this will help people get over the scary barrier of an API.
Thank you!"
2HfSFdPEFRg,"This is great!
I would like to ask, did you learn these things on the job or before?"
2HfSFdPEFRg,You’re too generous
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hey Alex, I can't thank you enough for all the useful videos and resources you share. Thank you so much for all your efforts. I have learned a lot from your videos and still learning...!! keep doing the great work."
2HfSFdPEFRg,What would be a learning pathway to get from zero to understanding this?
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Thank you so much, Alex!! It is really intriguing for me. I cannot wait for the further relevant projects."
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Hi Alex, you've such a great way to explain processes. Thank you for the content. Greetings from Brazil "
2HfSFdPEFRg,Thanks! You absolutely butchered that metaphor
2HfSFdPEFRg,Thank you for uploading this. It was worth watching
2HfSFdPEFRg,Thank you for explaining it so well. <3
2HfSFdPEFRg,"Super helpful as always @Alex . 
Love that you didn't censor the glitches, errors, and obstacles and instead explained that it's a reality and described how you deal with it.  This is as helpful as the technical aspects."
2HfSFdPEFRg,Thank you!!

Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thank you for everyone's feedback on this video. The intention of this video was to compare the UI and management tools for each of these, but the title and thumbnail was not representative of that. I updated the title and thumbnail to reflect it better. I do plan on diving into the actual databases to look at things like scalability, speed, and more. Thank you again for your feedback!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"If choosing MS SQL, gClouds offers FREE licensing on GCP. IDEAL for startups!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I prefer Microsoft SQL Server over PostgreSQL and mySQL.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Great, succinct discussion: very helpful!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I'm not sure why someone that is a part of the PostgreSQL team doesn't see that their browser based IDE is FUGLY! It just slows everything down in development.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"""Excel is Exel an everybody uses it"". Well not. Excel is just one spreadsheet out of many. Like sql server is just an implementation of sql out of many. Probably you never had heard of Lotus 123, or Quattro Pro from the MS DOS era... now you have Libre Office, Google Docs,,Quadratic, Gnumeric just to name a few alternatives!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I love your multi-dimensional analysis and recommendation; you definitely didn't leave any space for doubt. Thank you! 😊👍
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,extremely shallow comparisson
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I mean you can just download sql express for free and then you can use MS SQL server for completely free
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,some good info. stop being 'completely honest'....not great as part of your delivery.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,S.Q.L. sequel is the film that comes after the first film!
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,OPEN-SOURCE Has nothing to do with if the software is free or not there is FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) but open source just means that the source code is available for you to view and it also means that you are allowed to modify the software however you want
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Used MSSQL for the longest
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I want to install smss sql Microsoft, but it’s showing error demical, can anyone tell the fix?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thanks Alex!Q
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"This video could have been a minute long, with zero content until 90 seconds in, and almost no info in the remaining 15 minutes. This is painful."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,thank u
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Great video Alex, what is missing in free version of sql server? Just wanted to know"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Interesting.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Very useful video.. Thank you Alex. This is exactly what  I was looking for!!!!
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"As a begginner, which one shoud l focus more or start with for thos two main sql MySql or Postgre?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Great video! Thanks! Well edited, you showed the interface and usage, the main differences, everything quickly and clearly, without wasting our time, and even gave an honest answer about which one you think is better instead of just saying ""it depends""! Congratulations +1 subscribe"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"You're a very effective communicator. Love your videos! Thanks, Alex."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I have Microsoft SQL server and on pasting the code to create tables i get this error -A table can only have one timestamp column. Because table 'encounters' already has one, the column 'STOP' cannot be added. how to resolve this."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,what about BigQuery?
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"In terms of queries, Is it same  for pgsql and MS server or else."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Even before coming across this video, my learning preferences for SQL was MS SQL then PostgreSQL then MySQL 😅"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,The biggest mistake that you ever can make is to say that open source means free and forget about cost of ownership that includes hardware that you need to cover your load requirements. In some sort of scale you may find that it is equal or even cheaper to use paid db because you need fewer hardware.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thank you Alex for keeping it direct and easy to understand. I worked for more than 20 years as a software developer since Turbo Pascal, Delphi, Visual Basic, Java, SQL, and after 8 years I'm getting updated to come back programming. Thank you for these videos."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Can someone pls guide me, which database is preferable for core banking domain between mssql and postgresql?
 
apart from Oracle."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Hey Alex. Avid consumer of your content here!

I am sorry Alex but I have to say something... you kept on referring to MySql, Postgresql, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Tools as SQL, or types of SQL. 
MySql, Postgresql, and Microsoft SQL Server are database management systems, NOT SQL. These 3 database management systems store data using the relational model, thus they are also referred to as relational database management systems.
SQL is a query/programming language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. Thus your SQL knowledge can be used/applied to any of these 3 relational database management systems.

Peace! 🙂"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"This is really helpful for me as I am studying and trying to get in the analytics field, knowing which to focus on is really useful. Thanks Alex."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,@AlexTheAnalyst Is there a version for mac users ?
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Standard SQL is called “ANSI” Standard (DB2).  PostgreSQL follows the “PL/pgSQL” SQL Dialect (similar to Oracles flavor - but Im reading DB2 now supports PL/1 too).   Transact-SQL was created by a company called “Sybase.”  Microsoft as is their pattern “partnered’ with Sybase and basically took their tech to make MSSQL-Server.  To day MSSQL-Server is my favorite flavor of DB - but I’ve been in Oracle/PostgreSQL recently.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,How about MariaDB?
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Hi, mysql es down in the principal page. Any other page to download MySQL?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Talking about importing the files into server SQL server is the best we don't need to take care about the data it takes all the data but and no need to convert to csv if it's an excel file.

 comming to postgresql it's a pain we need to input all column names even after inputing all the columns there is no gaurantee that the file will import without errors we need to take care about the formatting of the csv such a large porcess 

And comming to MySQL the import is some what easy but when exporting a large data set it sucks and takes more time even after waiting for the import for me sometimes it doesn't import any data these were faced 8n MySQL workbench,for MySQL we can use dbeaver which is better than MySQL workbench and import time a lot faster"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Great review. Thanks.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thanks for the video. I use SSMS with TSQL for work, but want to create something myself and don't want to pay. Although there are free options with Microsoft, I would like to not worry about scaling up. Think I might test out MySQL."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"This is me right here... my college DB course textbook was in Oracle, the class project was in MySQL, and now my internship is SQL Server"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"My biggest issue with postgre is importing data and the quotation marks.

I had to create the table Schema with exactly same column before it will work."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Alex, before finding you out i learned MySQL and would like to do your portfolio projects in MySQL, can you please guide me a bit there?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"MySQL for small to mid-size business with a regional focus.

Postgress for National and International focus.  Best for this type of relational large scale database.

MS SQL for a National and International focus, plus the MS discount for mixing it with Azure and Office 365.  Best for those all into using Microsoft only."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Thanks for your honest review Alex...
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thank you so much, Alex. I have a question. I uploaded a data containing more than 1000 rows. I want to see all rows, but it always return 135 rows. How can it happen?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I don't think the words: ""SQL"" and ""Database"" mean what you think they mean..."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Another great video! Your channel is truly amazing for someone trying to get into the world of data analysis (like myself)! Also extra points for the office reference in the data! ;)
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I've used SQL Server at extremely large scale (taking in 1TB of data per day) and MySQL at very large scale. You get what you pay for. The performance, tools, configurability, SQL features, stability, etc are vastly better with SQL Server. It's not even close. I've only used Postgres in small instances but I would choose it over MySQL."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Could you please zoom in while typing?
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Hey Alex, can you make a video on importing and exporting data in each of these SQL?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"this review is not ideal since it’s only scratching the surface.
There is many differences that give MS SQL edge, specially when it comes to performance and scalability.
MySQL is ideal for small usage, MS SQL for enterprise, Postgres is for between.
Also, even Microsoft SQL sometime is not ideal for some situations and Oracle database is the only way out, which is extremely expensive compare to these database. in face, MS SQL price is literally nothing compare to MS SQL"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Tns alex, your clips always get me out of the delimma"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Will focus on Posgres vs SQL Server in a quick post.Postrgres peformance is awful for complex sql with many joins, plus security is bad in most scenarios when you compare with SQL Server. This is from my experience with large tables. Things that take minutes and hours in postgres will take seconds in SQL Server. That's a fact. Also the default Postgres sql tool is not up to standard  when you compare it to SSMS. Also if you are trying to locate  a performance issue i have so many optons and tools in SQL Server  but it's all very basic in postgres."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Did you just base your decision for which rdbms to get based on the frontend they ship? Pretty bad way of choosing a database system.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Excellent comparison video - thank you!!!  I used MongoDB (NoSQL) for a project because I wanted to be able to store ragged data formats for program preferences that wouldn't form neatly into a row/column table.  I have since migrated to PostgreSQL since it has support for JSON and JSONB types which are even ""indexable"". Another big reason I went to Mongo was its ability to index spatial data (maps).  Given Postgres's tight integration with mapping using PostGIS, it makes it a no-brainer for any map based database usage.  BTW, I can't stand PG Admin, either when it was a compiled Windows/Mac program or now as a web based solution.  It's slow and painful to use.  I found a great multi-use SQL client, DBeaver, which in the free/community version supports many SQL versions and is lightning fast!  Note: I have no relationship whatsoever to DBeaver - just found it, starting using it and became a huge fan!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I don’t think it’s very fair  to compare DB server by their default client UI. There are a lot of better clients like Postico for postgresql.  I won’t lie, I think Postgres is the best as it support JSON, Geometry data with Postgis, easy replication and fail over built in, good CLI tools to backup, restore, and a lot of others extensions… it’s the Swiss knife of SQL! As for double quotes in syntax, it’s only required for special keyword and if not snake case lowercase."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"viewer: Why we use MySQL ?
Content-Creator : Because I love it .
Really Bro!!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,dang it.. mysql workbench doesn't run on ARM (mac mini m1).
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I used SQL Server extensively from about 1997 to 2003.  One thing I recall is they had was ability to view the entity relationship diagram which is important for design.  Does MySQL server client have this as well?  I really want to get into SQL Development again, on my mac."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thank you Alex. You have helped me all the way through college, and now with my first interview in the real world. I appreciate all the help"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Shallow & somewhat misleading comparison...
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"in my opinion as PostgreSQL user, Microsoft SqlServer in another level With t-Sql which enable you to create awesome functions run on server , Which Done by programming languages in another database engines ,  MySQL is so popular because of powerful but because of easy reach and host , but in SqlServer send some variable by the name of stored procedures and let hem do the validation entries calculation and return you confirm or he rollback all changes as bulk of entries done by one procedures"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,@alextheanalyst Great video. Any chance a comparison adding Oracle SQL Developer in the future?
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Hi great content!!! Question...I've been learnig from SQLite and now I want to learn MySQL but just upload a dataset is hell! it so SLOW!!! does are another way to practice in MYSQL or may be to upload data in a way that it does not too sloooooow?! your chanel is awesome!
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Converted an app from SqlServer to Postgres.  One huge issue is that Postgres does not allow temporary variables (you'd have to use a function), while TSQL does.  There's a way to do that sort of functionality in Postgres outside of a function, but it's not intuitive, and it's barely written up on the internet, so it took a while to get an optimal solution.  That said, I do like Postgres a bit more - seems a bit more ""pure"".

Postgres also seems to have a lot of datatypes.  This might be relevant for some, though it's probably not an issue for the vast majority of apps.

And yes, Postgres is free and SqlServer licensing is very complex and can get expensive (in the lower tier, you need server licenses as well as client licenses, and the client licenses are per device)."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,SQL Server is the easiest to use...My opinion
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Alex, Sybase invented T-SQL. Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server uses T-SQL."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Awesome! I was really looking for clear clarification like yours!
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Muito bom.. :)
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"but only postgresql is 100% for free even for commercial use,  right? and it provides geo spatial functions and it has much easier syntax for uuid and json object selector than mysql."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"After over 30 years of database development, I can tell you there is no comparison between the three tools mentioned. In any situation where scalability is of value, Sql Server is the only true candidate; for developers, there is a free unlimited version of Sql Server (DEV ED) that works very well. For home/personal web site use, Sql Server Express coupled with SSMS is unbeatable... if used correctly."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Quoted column names are also required in Oracle if the column names are mixed case.  To avoid having to quote all required names in queries I always capitalise on import of data.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"My pet peeve is when people pronounce SQL as ""Sequel"""
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Favorite type of SQL?   Or favorite relational database?  You are using the term ""SQL"" when you mean ""relational database""."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,This is like comparing food by the plates you use to serve it.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Let me give you the real answer. If you want your database hacked then use that POS microsoft sql server. If you like licking Ellisons behind use mysql.  if you want a free database that kicks ass, Use Postgres + DBeaver. can’t tell you how much I loathe MSSQL"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"You don't talk about different types of SQL, you talk about different type of management tools."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"SQL Server has advantage in diagram view, you can easily design the database at SSMS."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"You completely missed the actual essential differences: Scalability, Stability, Performance. There is a huge difference from PostgreSQL/MSSQL to MySQL."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Ugh, the pronunciation of Postgres is so bad, that I can't watch this and question its validity.  Sorry, I was really interested in this comparison.  Also, It's My Ess Cue El, not MySequel."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"This is not of a comparison of the DB, but the defacto UI tools.  There's no comparison of any real technical details.

MySQL is IMHO the absolute worst when it comes to data consistency and expectation of results.  It is not very ANSI SQL compliant and even utf8 isn't. Every single time I use it, it pisses me off. Not to mention Maria is really what you'd want to use doing MySQL is barely maintained.

SQL Server is decent as a developer. Nice still as an administrator. The Enterprise features are super easy compared to MySQL and PostgreSQL.

As a developer, I think PostgreSQL is leaps and bounds the best of the three. From geospatial data support to JSON functionality. Custom types, etc. It's just better in so many ways. Also there is commercial support from EnterpriseDB. That said, high availability configuration is the most difficult of the three. But it's well supported in every major cloud provider so you don't have as much to worry about in practice.  Not to mention wire compatible alternatives like cockroach etc."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Wow, this video is suprisingly bad. You claim that you compare the databases, and what you actually spend time on is looking at the management UI. That's the least important part of any database.

And it just hurts my ears that you keep saying ""sequel"" which is just wrong."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Useful video, but the audio sounds like it was recorded off Single Side Band.  Excessive compression?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,MySQL does implicit commit on DDL commands when run in transaction. Which ruins the purpose of using a transaction.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"I'd be interested to know a feature Postgres lacks, which SQL Server has... Postgres is what I suggest people replace Oracle with. MySQL is what I suggest people who want to use just SQL use, and I don't recommend anyone use SQL-Server"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Doesn’t matter how good MS tech is, market is moving into open source. Tooling support wasn’t mentioned here."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,The Linux drivers for Microsoft SQL are absolute garbage and Indian contractors are the only people on the planet who want to use it.
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,I am running sql server on my mac
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Postgres delivers a level of features and performance that far outranks both MySQL and MSSQL. It comes out of the box with a bunch of features and optimizations such as native json support, gis support and pg/psql. I agree MySQL is a good ""beginner friendly"" DB, but for serious work I only typically use two databases; PostgreSQL (stand alone deployment) and SQLite (embedded)."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Totally agree with your assessment.  First database server I used was SQL Server.  Used it for over a decade and build many, very large databases.  Latest job has a large, cloud based Postgresql DB.  There are SO many times I think, man!, this would be so much easer in T-SQL (and would end up with a faster, more efficient query) instead of this weirdly complicated CTE.  I also miss SSMS *so* much.  I've been searching for something that has a similar feel and efficiency.  Nothing... :(  Anyone?"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thanks @Alex for taking the liberty to explain the differences and similarities on different SQLs. Really informative. However, we don't choose what to use. It's the employer's choice."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Having so little and even false knowledge about databases, you should definitely not make videos about this subject!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Well, you should compare the SQL language dialect differences, because some of the DB servers have the built-in programming language 'extensions' and they are really quite different. But the SQL language is quite standardized (by ISO , IEEE standard or something) and the difference between the SQL dialects is mostly the servers' built-in functions, like string or data values processing and some special language extensions which are using the specific features of each DB-server. For example, the MS SQL server is using the T-SQL (Transact-SQL) programming language extension, but the PostgreSQL is using  the PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostGres Structured Query Language) and the Oracle DB-servers are using the PL/SQL (Programming Language/SQL) extension. The PL-extensions are used for the server-based business logic programming, mostly, for writing stored procedures, user functions, triggers, packages, etc. So, in my opinion, you should compare the SQL language dialect differences, not the PL-extensions and not the IDEs (which is not a property of the SQL language itself)."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"You are comparing database system that are different. 
The syntax is part of the tool but never should be the first choice when it comes to decide which database system we are about to choose.
For example, mysql is normally not durable (unless they changed it); it means that you might loose some information in case of crash. So if you own a company that needs to be sure that no data is lost in case of crash and you choose mysql because it's easier to code/understand, you might get a lot of trouble when you server will crash and part of your data is gone.
When it comes to maintenance, there is always a trade off between a system that has great support and a system that has less (paid vs free). 
Same comes with community. The bigger the community, the less pain you will have when looking for someone having a solution to your problems... These are important criteria too.
For the rest, every database system has most in common in the language."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"PostgreSQL is usually pronounced ""post gress""  and if you included the QL, you say "" Q L"" at the end, but since Postgres can also be a NoSQL DB (key pairs, JSON document storage, etc.), most people who use it regularly call it just Postgres.."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Sorry, but those are the user interfaces that comes by default with the DBMs. Not a comparison by itself, which should start by how well they implement the relational algebra, and then how they implement the the desired properties about transactions, concurrency, indexing, consistency, security, permissions granularity, logging, recovery, escalation, mantainance, troubleshooting support, isolation levels and scopes, hinting and how much you'd rely on them, and so forth."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Thanks for sharing this. In my personal experience, PostgreSQL is the most fully featured and powerful Database out of the 3 you compared. PostgreSQL is the fastest-growing of all relational databases (a lot of innovation coming from PG community). There is also a plethora of extensions for many use cases and PG is being adopted as the core of many new cloud-native databases (neon, Yugabyte, Google's AlloyDb, CitusDB, AWS Aurora (Serverless as well), EnterpriseDB, and others). But I can't argue that the 3 of those are SUPER POWERFUL and loved relational databases. Keep sharing these great videos!"
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,"Overall I think this video is good exposure for people who are unfamiliar with database options, but its lacking on accuracy in some ways. For example you mention T-SQL and that its only available for SQL Server and while this is true, you failed to mention that MySQL and Postgres also have something similar. T-SQL is just the scripting language, in MySQL its just regular ANSI sql, but in Postgres theres PG/SQL which is heavily influenced by Oracles PL/SQL. Also you mention not being able to show T-SQL which was again not particularly accurate. The easiest way to do that would have been to show that you can declare variables and use them in queries. Again the same applies to Postgres. 

the other thing that I found could have been a bit better is how you mentioned the sys objects in SQL server. There are equivalents in both MySQL and Postgres as well.

To me it seemed that you were not necessarily comparing databases, but rather comparing the administrative and development tools for each database type. I've worked with all three tools, and a few others and I find that MySQL workbench is the jankiest, but then again its an Oracle product so its to be expected."
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,it is more like of overview of mysql clients with does not make much sense in terms of db differences
Q7i6zxHVj2Q,Hello i found your channel yesterday & watched some of you videos they are really great !!! good job on !!!! all the information very helpful i just have one question based on your experience & this video seems to me that the way to go to learn SQL would be MYSQL i saw that you you have some good video's about Microsoft SQL tutorial. so my question is where could be a place to learn specifically MySQL ?? i looked for courseara but could not find some options for Mysql i found a lot for IBM SQL but not Mysql so any place you can recommend me to look for Mysql learning ? im very interested in Data analytics skills because that is the way im moving my professional grow.  so thanks a lot & im watching today your tutorials for Tableau because I'm interested as well to learn this tool so thank you for your time & dedication for these videos that help a lot.
ddn-2r1j_OU,Great tips. Thanks Alex for always sharing more than knowledge to your audience. You are my best data analyst mentor.
ddn-2r1j_OU,This is just on time.❤
ddn-2r1j_OU,So my main distraction is my 3 year old right now. How do i get rid of him? Haha! Just joking!! Love to all stay at home mums who are returning to work with better soft skills than they had imagined thanx to their kiddos! You are all an inspiration! Thank you too Alex. I have a computer science degree and just starting with data analysis after 3 years at home.
ddn-2r1j_OU,Subscribed Alex…. Wish me luck to become data analyst ❤ u push us all brother…thanks in advance
ddn-2r1j_OU,"creating routine is useless for me coz i never stick to them :"")"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Man getting rid of the distractions is so hard when they are entirely external and out of my control
ddn-2r1j_OU,I'm not a procrastinator- but I am an amateur crastinator
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I am more a pc gamer, the distraction is basically in front of me at all time. Why not use laptop, simple I have better pc than laptop so I just love lot more doing work on it."
ddn-2r1j_OU,Wish I found this video sooner. But I’m finally close to where I need to be to start applying
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I may not get an answer to this but I have a question for someone who is thinking about going into this job. I am currently working on a PhD in educational research. Naturally studying in the research field I analyze data so I have some experience in excel, Jasp, and spss. (Not much because I am one semester in) I obviously would need training in some of the other stuff you mentioned in other videos such as power bi and SQL, but my first question would be could I put certificates from coursera on a job resume? And my second question would be that after I finish this degree do many places give you pay raises? I’m more trying to evaluate my options for when I get out, or before I get out sense I earn a master’s in route to my PhD."
ddn-2r1j_OU,❣️❣️❣️😞😞
ddn-2r1j_OU,Thank you so much for this . Been procrastinating for a year to get into data analytics . I’m going to take all this steps now & come back here when I get the certificate !
ddn-2r1j_OU,I will see this later...
ddn-2r1j_OU,Thank you!
ddn-2r1j_OU,"For me, my biggest distraction in my life is my boyfriend 😅😂i know that i Love him so much and that's why I got habit of him and it really getting hard to get rid of him, only for his time i procrastination every single day but I'm really impressed and always motivated by watching your videos and i hope my will power never let me down for my career thank you Alex 😊❤"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I love the motivation behind this video! 6 months ago I decided I wanted to be a Data Analyst. I cut out my distractions and set some goals. I took the Google Certificate, completed the capstone, built a portfolio, and 3 weeks ago I started applying to jobs. Its definitely tough juggling a full time job/family as well but I can’t wait to see where the grind gets me in the long run! Currently I spend 2h every day of the week job hunting/applying and every weekend working on projects to add to my portfolio. I keep telling myself all this hard work has to pay off, I can’t wait! Now if only I could find some time to take more Coursera courses haha."
ddn-2r1j_OU,Might as well just put my name on the title
ddn-2r1j_OU,When Is your birthday? Alex!
ddn-2r1j_OU,I'll watch this later.
ddn-2r1j_OU,My procrastination is...   watching this video
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Perfect video! I have been studying  a lot and sometimes I feel myself overwhelmed and not sure if my approach is the most correct, but I stick with my plan, adjusting here and there, little by little I can see progress. That's about creating momentum..."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Hey Alex! I found your channel today and I don’t think it’s hyperbole to say it’s already changed my life. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I’m no longer intimidated by this field after gaining a better understanding of it through your videos. 

One thing I wanted to comment on, it seems like there’s a sweeping filter on your audio? I have a background in audio. If you’re running into any issues, it’d be my absolute pleasure to help out in any way that I could. :)"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"When you talked about getting rid of distractions and your xbox, it reminded me what I did a couple of months back that I also sold my ps4 for the same reasons. It's really the aspect that is harder for me to get through. We as humans are most of the time looking for short gratification and it's easy to forget about the long term planning. Great content!"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Thanks a lot Alex! This was much needed! I am so glad I watched this!
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Click on below link for most asked Excel Interview questions 👇
https://youtu.be/aH2m5yxIiyY"
ddn-2r1j_OU,I have been procrastinating to even watch this video when I first saw it in my feed 😂. Definitely need to make a plan. Hopefully I don't procrastinate doing that and get started again.
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Great video! Alex, how did you improve your communication skills to make vídeos?"
ddn-2r1j_OU,good points
ddn-2r1j_OU,What worked for me was burning the escape ship behind me by leaving my old employer. I have no other option but to learn the skills to succeed as an analyst. I saved up enough money to pay my bills for a few months before jumping ashore.
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Great video but I don't agree by getting rid of your distractions is the solution. I love videogames and that's my entertainment sometimes but not addicted to it. So if you have a family and your kids are the distraction you will get rid of them?? or friends who keep you asking you, you will cut your friendship?? no, it's about time management and how can you squeeze these your goals and ambition in life. You need to enjoy life also, and my problem is not videogames, it's the damn phone but can't get rid of it as I need it."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"So, I downloaded this video to watch it later. I'm beyond salvation"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Very difficult especially when the multiple billion/trillion dollar companies hire the best minds to create algorithms and things to keep you distracted.
ddn-2r1j_OU,I will watch the video in some time.
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thanks Alex. 
Seems you made this video just for me."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I keep pricrastinating on actually making a github/website.
I've received so many rejections to Data analyst jobs and internships lately I'm wondering if thats the issue."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Hard agree with physically removing distractions.  Part of what makes distractions so easy to fall prey to is the easy access to them.  If you have to put in more than minimal amount of effort (like looking up a password) to start the distraction, unless there's serious avoidance issues at play you likely won't do that activity. Completely removing options that let you avoid doing what you need to do is a game changer."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Message received, coursera course activated.  Thanks Dad! (Genuinely, thank  you for the content, it's gold)"
ddn-2r1j_OU,already failing at not procrastinating because I stopped working on my certificate to watch this video lmao
ddn-2r1j_OU,"It's totally possible to do this! I was a stay at home mom for 5 years and now that it's time to go back to work I stumbled on your channel and after 3 months of dedicating my free time to watching your videos, taking the Google Data Analytics Certification on Coursera, and using all your tips to make a portfolio, write a resume, and interview I got a Data Analyst job!! Thank you so much Alex!"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"HELLO ALEX THIS VIDEO ON PROCSATINATION WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO BREAK THE DUCK OF PROCASTINATION, WANT TO TAKE SQL SERIOUS, WHERE DO I START FROM TO LEARN ON YOUR CHANNEL, THE FIRST VIDEOS I NEED WATCH"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I am trying to help you & Alex, please give me your xbox & PS3/4 whatever to me :-D"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I get what you're saying in this video, but this sounds a bit like a recipe for burnout.  Plus I'm not sure this whole ""you must be productive every minute you're awake"" culture is healthy.  I get we all have so much time on this planet, but it can't be all nose to the grindstone efficient learning, working, etc."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thanks a lot Alex! I'm exactly that kind of person who will keep procrastinate things over and over again. It's never ends for me. Making these goals and good habits might be helpful for me:) 
Nice video and keep going!"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Great video - thanks for posting this for so many to learn from around the globe! This is Patrick from Mind Life Flow and I am always interested in how people are using mindfulness practices to improve their life. Did you use mindfulness practice to increase focus ?
ddn-2r1j_OU,I got another two and half years until I finish my BA for health information technology. I finish my second AAS in early 2023 and take my test for RHIT and a lot of my career path and classes mirror Data Analytics so I’m gonna start working to broaden my skill set.  At 35 yrs old the thing I find is if I start it I will finish it just gotta start.
ddn-2r1j_OU,thank you for this video.
ddn-2r1j_OU,"This is helpful and encouraging! A lot to think about, especially when it comes to eliminating distractions. Thank you!"
ddn-2r1j_OU,You are 😍
ddn-2r1j_OU,Great topic and a really good video 👍
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thanks, for sharing your experience. A proven tip to overcome acute procrastination is just starting working because once you get the car moving, it gets much easier."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thank you, I needed to hear this at the right time, Im Im trying to be an Analyst by the end of this year, this is exactly whatt I needed to hear"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Great Video!
ddn-2r1j_OU,"This is a very useful video, thabk you! I am in the ""pushing things off"" cycle for almost a year and really need to break it through. My biggest problem now is there is no way I can set deadlines for myself to follow (I seem just don't have enough respect to it when I am the one to set it). I can lost process and goal and stuffs   but I always ended up breaking my own deadline and didn't get things down. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve this particular part?"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Great timing; I definitely needed this video & the comments section 💯 Thank you Alex & commenters!
ddn-2r1j_OU,"I really didn't expected this video to hit so hard, thank you man. Your channel is great💎"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"simple, not easy"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thanks alex, a timely video. I was pushing making my first portfolio project since a long time stuck in tutorial hell. Today however; i started making it, i came to youtube after doing today’s work on it and this video shows up."
ddn-2r1j_OU,I should be studying my machine learning course... but I'm watching this instead
ddn-2r1j_OU,I really need to hear this today. Thank you so much for giving me motivation to start getting my shit together.
ddn-2r1j_OU,I think it is going to be another great video but i will watch it later ... :) ...kidding !! Great video as usual !! Sorry I have been missing but we have a new member in the family !
ddn-2r1j_OU,"My ADHD went undiagnosed till last year at 27, and even now with treatment, procrastination is always going to be an issue for me. Something that sounds so simple like ""just get rid of distractions"" does not work for me, as I can be distracted by literally anything and everything. If any ADHDers are reading this, you CAN progress but it is a lot harder and you do need to find things that work with your brain - neurotypical advice like ""get a planner"" does not usually work for us. 

Data analysis is actually great for ADHD brains as we are creative, problem solvers, we think outside the box, and are great at pattern recognition. Despite the misleading name we also have great attention to detail. I found your channel when I was looking into data as a career, I'm almost done with the Google DA Cert and I just landed my first job in data. I've only been taking this seriously for 5 months. 

Alex this isn't to discount your advice or anything, but just reassurance for anyone else here with ADHD - we beat ourselves up a lot for procrastinating and not feeling good enough but it's a result of our disability, our brains are different and we have to work around that."
ddn-2r1j_OU,I will watch this video later ..
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Hi alex, im looking to build up and learn skills for becoming a data analyst. I feel overwhelmed because there is so many tools to learn sql, excel, tablo, python etc and i dont know where to start. Do you recommend me learning through youtube videos for each platform and then taking the google/ibm certification and building projects?"
ddn-2r1j_OU,Seems like you made this video exclusively for me lol. Thanks btw :)
ddn-2r1j_OU,Thank you
ddn-2r1j_OU,It's so hard😭😭😭. Thanks for the tips because my motivation has definitely dissapeared.
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Heya, Alex how's it going? I have a massive issue with procrastination.... It's been a rough couple of years and I feel like I'm still struggling to get back on my feet, just find it very hard to stay disciplined and stay on my own schedule. Will really need to get an income soon....

Good news is I've finally finished the Google Data Analytics course, so I guess that's some progress there. The plan is to continue working on Data Camp with the coding bits and actually start on doing a project or two for my portfolio. The hard part is the actual sticking to the plan.

Really appreciate your videos, really like how they're always down to earth and they've really been a huge help to me this past year."
ddn-2r1j_OU,Thanks for the video Alex!
ddn-2r1j_OU,You got it together for your wife and kids Alex let’s be serious. The rest is generic advice
ddn-2r1j_OU,Thank you
ddn-2r1j_OU,Almost 29 and still couldnt stop procrastinating. Thats why I didnt grow in terms much even after graduating as Engineer.
ddn-2r1j_OU,Played this on 2x speed to really incorporate the tips
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Procrastination is good and natural, nothing really wrong with, obsession with work is unnatural and unhealthy though.
Just enjoy life!"
ddn-2r1j_OU,I am at first data analyst job but the way of the company not what I expected and frankly disappointed. Still have to continue to learn and doing that by taking a SQL boot camp course.
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Hi Alex , I want really thank you and make sure you know that you are making a huge difference for a lot of people with the content you're creating .I'm getting into Data Analysis and I've finished the SQL tutorial from beginner to advanced on your channel and now starting the Excel Tutorial. But I wanted to know if you're gonna make a tutorial for Python as well or would you recommend a free Source to get a full Python tutorial on  . @Alex The Analyst"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Another fruitful, compact, bull's eye content. Thanks Alex."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thanks for the video Alex! I’ve been watching your other videos and doing the portfolio projects and am going through these steps right now to break the procrastination cycle. This was a great piece of inspiration for me. 

Side note, for anyone who’s looking for more inspirational/self-help content on YouTube, I recommend Better Ideas."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"needed to see that today, thanks man"
ddn-2r1j_OU,This was a small but strong wake up call.  Thanks Alex.
ddn-2r1j_OU,Failing to plan is planning to fail
ddn-2r1j_OU,"**Alex's video pops up on my notifications tab about how to stop procrastinating**
Me: puts it on Watch Later and procrastinate on watching that video as well"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Hello,Mr Alex.
Do you have any advise for the freshers who are trying to get into data analytics field?"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Time & energy - those are my blockers. For me, it's creating extra time and energy in addition to my 50-hour/week full-time job. I realize some might argue that if it's a priority, you'll make the time for it. The only success I've had at attacking this issue is trying to spread studying and prep time out into 30-minute chunks since I can't afford an additional 2-3 hours per day. I'd have no balance if that were the case. Adding this type of activity in incremental chunks is the only way I can do this and not sacrifice too much family time."
ddn-2r1j_OU,Literally just switching my phone off is so effective for this
ddn-2r1j_OU,Youtube shorts and Reels..the real enemies of mankind
ddn-2r1j_OU,how to stop procrastinating as he posts it at 5 AM my time.... Alex is on it today!
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Thought there will be something new , but unfortunately same words"
ddn-2r1j_OU,"When you mentioned"" video games "" 😖😖...I've been on and off with that challenge.  Whenever I see "" season rewards"" , I'm just sucked
 in .😖😖"
ddn-2r1j_OU,watching this while i procrastinate haha
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Great video Alex! Speaking personally, my phone/YouTube are the biggest distractions I have currently. It’s so easy to waste 1-2 hours scrolling and watching random videos."
ddn-2r1j_OU,"Hello Alex, I hope all is well. Please read my Instagram message. Thanks"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"How many people who say ""sequel"" dislike hearing people say ""S.Q.L.""? How many people who say ""S.Q.L."" dislike hearing it called ""sequel""? How many people don't care either way? No one says MongoDB like ""Mongoldb"", but they say ""Mongo D.B."", and people do say ""Postgress"" instead of ""Posgresequel"" or ""Postre-S.Q.L."". In the voice of Kenan Thompsan, ""What's up with that?"""
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thanks for information. It would be very understandable with pictures and schemas.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Nice Job Alex - Good Explanation
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Thanks, it is useful however what I realised is that No SQL databases store data in an unstructured way with low latency of data retrieval and a new field can be added without a major issue."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"very clear, thanks"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,great video thank you!
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Finally I can say database is easy to learn. Thanks Alex
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Alex, this video is short and to the point esp coming from someone who is just starting out."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,You're a blessing bro
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"I am a Cloud Engineer and most of the time I'm dealing with the VM Instances and on the infrastructure side. SQL or Database is not my thing or I would say, I don't have a huge idea but because of this video, I am able to understand the differences between SQL and NoSQL as well as the benefits of the two. Thank you for this video bud! New subscriber here!"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Is that means there are chances for the sql to be no longer wanted in the few next years?
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"I use SQL for things like storing integer, decimal and boolean values and email addresses and password hashes. I always keep the sql table size relatively small. For large datas such as long text, image address et cetera, I use mongodb and I store the Id of the row from the SQL in the mongodb docs. I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform. This way it'll take much less time to refresh the memory and you'll have more cycles to access to the memory. But you gotta run linpack xtreme and memtest and if you can, plug a gpu in and run a time spy loop in order to validate stability."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Hey Alex! Thank you so much for giving us your knowledge and sharing your experiences! I feel so greatful for finding you!
I am a future data analyst (I took the Google Data Analytics course from coursera) and I have an issue. I want to practice on SQL and I cannot find a software to do data entry (my laptop has windows 7 operating system) could you please help me? I desperately want to practice on that!"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Nice video Alex! One question... Is a data lake one type of NoSQL database?
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Very helpful ! Thank you !
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thank you for explaining the concept in such brief and concise way.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Not a word about access methods? _Why_ is retrieval latency and scalability of NoSQL DBs supposedly better then that of relational databases? what makes search of unstructured (or semi-structured) data fast?  
Also, not a word on possibility of horizontal scaling of relational databases via table partitioning over many cluster members?"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Just stumbled upon your channel. I love it. So you have a sub from me.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thanks for this Video! There is NoSQL DBs with SQL query engines avaliable as well. For example CrateDB. Here you can use normal SQL grammar instead of learning a new like with Mongo.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"i had to decrease the speed of the video to the half, but I got the points sound  and clear....thanks"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Hi Alex, thank you for this wonderful video. I was wondering if you could do a video on how to fix the error message “role does not exist” in popsql."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Great Video!
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Open the below link and watch YouTube video for a Data Analysis Project Based on Excel 👇

https://youtu.be/G6hLUksU1b0"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"This is REALLY informative, would love for more similar short videos like this! You explained it really well, thanks Alex."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Great video! Somewhy the mic sound felt a bit off in this vid, is it just me? It sounded a bit unnatural/robotic sometimes."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Hi Alex can you tell me how to accept meeting invite automatically using ms graph api in outlook
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"A NoSQL database may or may not store data in a table with rows and columns. Definitely a wide-column database will be a row-oriented store with columns. [Cassandra or ScyllaDB, for example.]"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Bravo!
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Without degree can I be called data analyst if I go for Google data analyst professional certificate?
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Just putting this out there, the reason why SQL doesnt handle big/large transactions well, is cause of the ACID properties, specially the i, which is isolation, meaning transactions happen wihtout interrupting or affecting others, thanks to that, many sql databases lock the rows or columns being used, so in the case of receiving large and many queries, its easy tor each the point where you are trying to access data thats been locked thanks to a previous query, so its kinda like a bottleneck"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Hi alex
What is the best source to practice nosql?"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,thank you for this vid! i was recently wondering what's the difference between the two and then you uploaded a vid about it haha love how your explanation is short & simple to understand 😃👍🏼
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Your camera overlaps some of the fields you showed in the presentation which I found disturbing, but thank you for vodeo"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Alex, your videos helped me land a position as a Fraud Data Analyst right out of undergrad. I was offered the position in October 2021, graduted in December 2021, began my role in January 2022. Thanks for being such a great resource!!!"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Thanks a lot once again, Alex! Your channel is the first place where I look for something related to Data Analytics. If someone asked me for a single channel about DA, I would recomend yours. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy other channels, but I think the way you organize ideas and concepts is the most comprehensive for me."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Can you suggest best online source to learn sql
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Really helpful
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Will you also teach us the R programming language ?
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Quick question,

How does one break into the healthcare industry as a data analyst with no experience in that industry. All I have is a project about analyzing covid vaccination rates which I did research on. I want to work with clinical data or data where I can have an influence in policies or effectiveness of a treatment program."
Pf-9pjJK1e0,You’re my hero 🦸‍♂️
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thank you! This has been one concept that I was having a hard time finding an explanation for.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thank you for special video on a special day Eid Mubarak Mr. Alex.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Can you do a video about freelancing with Data Analysis, I think lots of us are curious about it"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Hey how you change excel to be white and no green? Your theme looks so cool in other videos.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,Thank you for sharing
Pf-9pjJK1e0,thanks for such an informative video. Very well explained.
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Intresting, tnx"
Pf-9pjJK1e0,"Thank you for creating such a succinct video about this distinction! Also, the analogy with picking up a heavy couch using 2 different methods, was superb!"
-bSkREem8dM,And there is Lakehouse too. Like Apache Hudi.
-bSkREem8dM,You smile like you were born without a CNS.
-bSkREem8dM,3 Years late but this is very helpful.  My agency is turning towards a Data Lakehouse now which I suppose somehow combines the functions of both a data lake and a data warehouse.
-bSkREem8dM,"Wow Alex, amazingly explained in a few minutes."
-bSkREem8dM,"Hallo Alex, 
You have missed two pieces in your analyze, which're data marts and data cubes. Beside that data warehouse is an old designation to what we call today data lake. Also, your last illustration is more about system like Hadoop. In resume, these three designations can swap one to another, and this is not a question of technologies, but it's about practices, configurations and qualities."
-bSkREem8dM,"The definition of database could be a couple of things, which is confusing. Many companies have a Data Warehouse (which is a type of database) which sources its data from a Data Lake, and/or an ERP/CRM transactional database, or some middleware. A 'reporting' database or 'semantic model' is a relational database used in reporting tools such as Power BI or Cognos, and typically represents a silo of information such as HR, Sales or Inventory, and contains more nuanced data , calculations and KPI's specific to that Silo. Many times it is sourced from the Data Warehouse itself, although if a company does not have the OLAP layer, it can also come from a Data Lake, and/or an ERP/CRM transactional database."
-bSkREem8dM,Thank you!

-bSkREem8dM,so basically I use my phone as a data lake
-bSkREem8dM,"Any softwares examples of data warehouse, database and a datalake."

-bSkREem8dM,"Well spoken, nicely explained, good presentation."
-bSkREem8dM,Data Lakehouse
-bSkREem8dM,What?
-bSkREem8dM,"Best explanation. Crisp, short and to the point. Thanks Alex!"
-bSkREem8dM,"tl;dr: Alex, is the ""Flexible Schema"" property for Database, correct? It seems contrarian to what a Relational Database is like, as it's supposed to be Schema-On-Write

---
I've taught myself about relational databases through https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z7fbCLSTw&ab_channel=Fireship, and I also saw this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ss42Vb1SU4&ab_channel=Exponent

When I was writing my notes from them, I remembered about the note that I wrote from watching your video here, specifically in 0:42 onwards, and when I cross-referenced it, I found that your explanation here seems to be a bit confusing, perhaps specifically the ""How the data is organized"" What do you mean by that? Because Flexible Schema sounds to me like a Schema-On-Read paradigm, and yet, a Relational Database is rigid, and the user must know the schema first, before you write it, so it should be Schema-On-Write. Or am I confused here?"
-bSkREem8dM,Nice video
-bSkREem8dM,"Wrong Dude, misleading video in some parts."
-bSkREem8dM,I have been wondering what the difference is between these three. You explained it very well. Glad I saw this video one day before my exam.
-bSkREem8dM,"Thank very much,  this is a very clear explanation."
-bSkREem8dM,There is also another less known term known as DATA contraction. It’s the process of getting rid of or expunge duplications or useless data from table and reducing the table size.
-bSkREem8dM,Thanks for the amazing video. Is there any difference between data warehouse and OLAP?
-bSkREem8dM,That was great.
-bSkREem8dM,this helped me get a better grasp on the 3. great video
-bSkREem8dM,This was a great video. Concise and very clear. Excellent job on keeping it brief and giving all the information either. Could not have asked for better video
-bSkREem8dM,thank you
-bSkREem8dM,"You are doing amazing, small suggestion - you are covering a lot of scree space, please see if you can get it smaller."
-bSkREem8dM,"Database => River (Data flows in through transaction, queried for Analysis purposes, One Relational type of data and Clean data)
Data warehouse => Dam (Reservoir of Data for specific purpose (i.e analytical processing) rigid schema )
Data Lake => Ocean  ( you can find everything here)"
-bSkREem8dM,"What's your work flow today? You dump data in different schemas in a data warehouse and then create a new one with the data model you need, star schéma, etc, to then query this new schema from Bi tools or data mining tools?"
-bSkREem8dM,Great to see this video. Now i've heard a new term called data lakehouse. Is it something new? or they are just playing verbal games?
-bSkREem8dM,Poor differentiation between all three. The differences are very vague. Description created  more questions.
-bSkREem8dM,amazing video- concise and very well explained
-bSkREem8dM,"Hi Alex, thank you for the concise and informative video. I was wondering if you do any online mentoring? Thanks"
-bSkREem8dM,very good explaination but I would have removed your camera windows because it's covering the slides
-bSkREem8dM,can you also make view on data lake vs delta lake vs data lakehouse vs databricks? it's confusing
-bSkREem8dM,"This was perfect. Short, sweet, and to the point. Thanks!"
-bSkREem8dM,Amazing explanation
-bSkREem8dM,Thanks!  I am glad you don't have that clunky accent most techies have.  :-)
-bSkREem8dM,"wow this nice, so much clarity and simplicity, thank you."
-bSkREem8dM,Very well explained. Thank you
-bSkREem8dM,very important tutorial before anyone begins their Dataware house or DataLake learning journey.
-bSkREem8dM,"I installed Python, Spark, Hadoop,  I can run pyspark in command prompt but when i try to run in VS code, the following error appear: PySparkRuntimeError: [JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED] Java gateway process exited before sending its port number."
-bSkREem8dM,"The way you explained was very simple and easy to understand 
Thanks"
-bSkREem8dM,"Thank you - for me, I learned new concepts - had no idea about data lake. Once again thanks for sharing your knowledge."
-bSkREem8dM,I don't know if I'll ever be ready for a Data Ocean...
-bSkREem8dM,Very great explanation
-bSkREem8dM,Should update this with ELT instead.
-bSkREem8dM,"Can you please work on your mic quality, its harsh to leason 😮 can't remember what sentence attached to whom."
-bSkREem8dM,The way you break it down and make it simple is great. Thank you for such a quick and insightful video.
-bSkREem8dM,"Well, no. I use a data lake in my work everyday. You don' need put it in a datawarehouse or database. You just need to use multi hop architecture and use the gold layer for analysis. Data lake is a no brain choice if you are working with big data. You can go one more step and jump into a delta lake with ACID transactions!"
-bSkREem8dM,best explanation of these 3 that I've seen
-bSkREem8dM,You're really good at walking people through concepts 👏👏👏👏👏👏
-bSkREem8dM,Are there any real-life practical examples of a data warehouse?
-bSkREem8dM,"This content is rich with innovative thoughts. I found a book with like themes that challenged my thinking. ""AWS Unleashed: Mastering Amazon Web Services for Software Engineers"" by Harrison Quill"
-bSkREem8dM,👌🙏🏻😎
-bSkREem8dM,It was helpful and made sense in terms of my current project too. Thank you!
-bSkREem8dM,Thank you so much. Having an already found understanding about OLTP and OLAP systems I was always struggling to understand what this datalake thing is! Now I know: It’s simply a file system. It’s a synonym for storage. Thank you for finally explaining this. I will always point to your video as a reference. 🎉
-bSkREem8dM,Thank you. That helped me to understand and take care if opportunities I'm handling
-bSkREem8dM,A data warehouse is built up for multi-dimensional analytics I'd say. This is what consitutes the difference between OLTP and OLAP.
-bSkREem8dM,I still feel that the distinction between DB and DW is hazy and frankly artificial. DW is in many cases a corporate trend.
-bSkREem8dM,Where does data mart stands? or it is same as Data warehouse?

xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion!
Hey, Alex

I really enjoyed your channel and all those invaluable sharing. 
I left my stable job in the public sector 8 months ago and started seeking a post-graduate degree in analytics this fall, just wanna share that I felt resonated when you mentioned logging out of those distractions like Netflix and prime video, and I know how hard it is to make yourself away from them. 
Thanks for helping me to make a resolute decision on getting rid of streaming media and making time for truly important tasks."
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onions! Alex
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion, and Mr Alex Bond, I just started with my data analyst career, your content and your tutorials help me a lot. I discovered partial over in your tutorials, and it's one of the functions I recently used in my new job that I truly feel like I'm an analyst now. (I'm self taught so I know a lot in your advanced sql, then know only a few in the intermediate ones) 

your content helped me prepare me on what I should expect on this field, and frankly, I wish I found this channel while I was looking for jobs, but for a career shift, my current company is already good. 

A friend asked me to be a guest speaker for their young professionals forum to teach stuff about excel. I'd probably go through your videos for pointers. I'm also eagerly waiting for your power bi and python videos. thank you for the content. Glad to be part of the 300, or 30"

xKdtP3IZbnU,"I’m currently in a job that pays pretty well ($85k) but I’m stretched wayyyyy too thin and I’m expected to be the master of all trades (yes, master). A sliver of my job requires me to pull data from our CRM, create dashboards and identify trends, percentages, have relationships with our tech vendors, etc.

Then one day a tech vendor told me I would be a good data analyst. I have yet to start training or a course but everything I watch and read gives me the impression that it would fit my skill set.

Going to do some LinkedInLearning courses to get started."

Alex, I am new to your channel because I have recently started studying data analytics. I respect you like a professor and was listening to your advice. After the vegetable part and your 007 photo… honestly you felt like an older brother who is giving me advice and telling me about his life. I never felt so connected with someone who isn’t a vlogger and with just one video! Thank you for all your videos!! 😊"
xKdtP3IZbnU,Nice video Alex. I’ve struggled with my time management lately and this is motivating. Also had the same personality results lol. Thanks for your advise!
xKdtP3IZbnU,I saw your whole video after downloading. Just telling you this because I saw that james bond photo. I was with you till the end 😂
xKdtP3IZbnU,"O N I O N

Hi Alex. I've been watching you for around a year and just got my first analyst job (no degree!!)

I'm so grateful for your content. Thank you, you're inspirational."
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Hi Alex, Is it possible to become a Data Analyst despite being a high school dropout?"
xKdtP3IZbnU,Hello sir.. sir I am Mtech Electrical n having experience of 5 years in teaching domain.. currently I am doing Google data analyst Coursera course.. is it worth to change my domain now? Does this certification helps? Please help
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onions…i would love to actually see no sql
xKdtP3IZbnU,"ONION!!!! Also, I think you provide quality videos too. You don't need fancy editing, just straight up providing amazing content. Thank you! and can't wait for Power BI and Python. :D"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion. Thank you Alex, enjoyed our coffee chat! FYI because of your videos, particularly building the portfolio and tutorials, I ended up going back to school and just got my first Data Analyst job that starts in May! I also graduate next week. Thanks for encouragement and the work you put into these videos!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onions.

Thanks for sharing this information (and your James Bond picture), Alex. I always find it interesting how others balance the desire to be a really good husband (and/or father) and be really good at their profession.

Not sure if this is on your content schedule yet, but I think it would be interesting if you did a video giving an overview of how you utilize cloud platforms as a data analyst and how you would start learning a cloud platform. Might also be interesting to touch on how you used cloud in your last position vs your current one if there is any significant differences there."
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Great snake plant! I didn´t know that fact about them! Really love your content man! thanks for sharing your wisdom like an onion with a lot of layers.
Thanks for taking time to be with us despite being alone with the kids!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion! I am currently trying to squeeze in more productive hours in my day, and this certainly helps, Alex. Thank you!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Question,  when do you dedicate time to level up your skills? I feel like I have to put 5 to 8 hours per week towards studying and professional development. Thank you for the great content as usual."
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onions are the best! I make my girlfriend cut them up though because my eyes like to swell shut. I got her some lab goggles and n95 mask which seem to be working well. I look forward to your upcoming tableau series. That's something I'm really interested in getting good at.  Thanks for what you do!
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion! It’s so funny that the plant is what you decided to bring up because throughout this entire video my adhd kept bringing me back to what kind of plant that was 😂 thanks for the content, managing my time is by far the hardest thing for me even though I have so much of it. Thanks for your input and insights!

Edit: love Luke’s videos but both your videos and Luke’s have their own separate charm and I look to both channels for different info and atmosphere!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onions. 60 hours a week sounds incredible. I have a job and no other obligation except my dog. And yet I drain my time away on Netflix and gaming. What you said about how you manage your time wasn't really revolutionary, but it sure was inspiring. Thank you for that. I really enjoyed it."
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Dear Alex, thank you for this honest and heartwarming video. I wanted to ask you one question. You as a person with so many responsibilities, kids, family, demanding job, bills to pay etc, how do you cope with stress? 
I am asking because I am in the beginning of my data analytics career, and stress is the main obstacle I am facing. 


Thank you for taking the time to reply!!

Best,"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"God bless you 🙏  
I always wanted study data analytics everyone around me including my advisor told me that was a bad idea because it was going to be so hard to find a job 😭"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"""Onions"" Thanks Alex! you just speaking adds value, cheers ! (that pic with the gun would pass off as a nice Netflix series poster ;-) looks kinda badass)"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Thanks for unraveling the next onion layers to come on your channel. You're one of a kind!
I wish you an easy time with your children!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,🧅🧅🧅!  Thank you for content truly! I'm really looking forward to content coming mentioned especially the Power BI tutorials. About halfway through the Google Cert and I know it's gonna be really helpful. You kinda looked like Agent 47 from Hitman in that photo LOL
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onions are one of my favorites. This had a lot of great tips! My husband always uses his time really well. He did many years of undergrad full time while working full time. He also taught himself day trading during commutes and in his free time while going to school and working! Lots of people were amazed or thought it was impossible to do what he did but he was just determined, worked quickly, and used his time wisely. And he doesn’t believe in sleeping too much, haha!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion!! I appreciate all your videos. I'm doing my MBA but want to get to data analysis since I liked some courses on data analysis and that's how I reached to your videos. Can you see any connections or path from MBA to Data Science? Thank you and best wishes!
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion.  That photo should be your profile picture 😆😆😆 That's awesome!  Thanks for sharing :)
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion!! 1% crew! First heard of data analytics in Jan 22. Started watching your vids and have an interview for a data analyst role next week!!!!!!
xKdtP3IZbnU,I am conflicted about all this time management and doing extra work. On one hand as you say really playing games is empty and leads nowhere but on  the other hand where does the grind lead? You will be making more money but if you work all the time what are you gonna spend that money on. I don't see other reason to grind couse if you enjoy something you don't  need time management to find time for it. And if we grind for money shouldn't we just try to manage our expectations?  There is no freedom in wanting more everytime you reach the next goal.
xKdtP3IZbnU,3% GMM!!! Good luck with the kids! The O2 generating snake plant will help. You have my vote for the next James Bond! Love the jibber jabber. F#$@ the haters. You need to defend yourself against them. Love the lineup!!!
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onions - 007 - no time to cry. haha
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Ok thats funny, i found GMM through recipes but i didnt love the show and got tired of it.  i was listening to you while playing world of warcraft on my day off, and then when you issued that challenge about staying further in the video, i bumped up the speed . . ."
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onions, INFJ-A, 007! And I hope your wife is back safe and sound. It's a real feat to take on a two and three year-old. As a devoted One Percenter, may I make a modest proposal? Since you have a love of astrophysics, how about you apply for one of SpaceX's many analyst positions (and of course you're a shoo-in once they hear ""Space Car""), then, after I finish all your videos (including your upcoming ones- can't wait for Power BI), you hire me to work in your department? What do you think? Great plan, right? A One-Percenter can dream!  🚀🚀  Love your videos. Thanks for all you do!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion :)
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Hi Alex , 

I really wanted to sign up for the Director of Data Analytics on your patreon page but it’s sold out. Will you be opening more spaces ?

Thanks"
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion great video!
xKdtP3IZbnU,🌰 onion. Great video Alex being intentional about time management and boundaries
xKdtP3IZbnU,onion gang
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Alex, how old are you if you don’t mind me asking?"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion. Good video. Everything is a tradeoff...As we've learned, many still don't get it. I forgot what No SQL is. Going to look it up this week."
xKdtP3IZbnU,I'd sure love to know the Onions of SQL Vs NoSQL.
xKdtP3IZbnU,"🧅🧅🧅🧅🧅 (1) I always watch/listen to the end, with frequent playback when listening.

(2) Thank you for the ‘till the end’ reward; its like hanging out with your fav teacher after school 😎

(3) I LOVED the snake plant shout-shout at 33:25, your wife did good with that gift! 🌱🎁

(4) Side-eye to the person who claimed you’re “running out of content” 😒

(5) Your description of your young kids as “fiesty” towards each other gave the visual of a WWE scenario in the next room 🤣"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Amazing! I appreciate this style of videos, when you are honest and personal, and you've touched upon the most important thing we have - our time. Thanks and greetings from Alex the analyst, but female one 😁  🧅🧅🧅"
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onions!
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion. I appreciate your perspective, but I hesitate to agree with the idea that all short-term enjoyment is inherently bad and should be removed from one's life. Moderation in all things, right? Nonetheless, thank you for all these great videos!"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Yellow onions, white onions, red onions, green onions... 😁"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"I felt compelled to pause the video to agree wholeheartedly with what you were talking about around the 9:00 mark, Alex. Making positive changes isn't about cutting things out; you have to actually replace that time with valuable efforts. If you don't intentionally fill that newfound gap in your schedule, you will inevitably fall back to old habits. You can't just quit old habits; you have to create new ones to take their place. (It's very similar with retirement too, where you need something to run to, not just work to run from... but I digress.) I don't know if you have followed any of Cal Newport's work but he talks about this a lot.

(Onions. 😂 Also, it's very annoying but my math is frequently off by a factor of 10 when I just throw numbers out there so kudos. -_-)"
xKdtP3IZbnU,mmmm onionsssss
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Hey, other 3%ers.  That James Bond pic is dope. Maybe a career change is due 😂"
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Made it to the end of the video, listening to this youtube channel while drinking my diet soda."
xKdtP3IZbnU,I found the reason why Netflix stock price dropped so much today…..it’s ALEX!!!
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onions
xKdtP3IZbnU,Onion🧅
xKdtP3IZbnU,"My wife andbI both work from home with a 2 year old and a 9 month old, seperating family time and work time feels impossible both feeling like I am putting more family responsibility on my wife and a still relatively new data analyst career and building a data team. Thank you for taking the time in your day to make these videos they are really helping me to know there is someone who has done this successfully. This is the first im learning of good mythical morning but I will check them out.
Onion
Always watch to the end, every one should have a picture of you and Luke on there desks."
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Can’t wait for the coming videos. I’m more of a shallot man, but onions are good too."
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Onion 🧅 
Love the James Bond style photo lol
Any video of yours I watch I watch all the way through. Thanks for the YouTube recommendation. Have not heard of that channel.

Do you have advice on how to learn the domain knowledge when coming from a different field?"
xKdtP3IZbnU,🧅
xKdtP3IZbnU,"Oignons
Thanks for the analytics on your time, personal advise and most of all emotional touch."
xKdtP3IZbnU,"I get INFJ-A everytime I do the test (3 times over the years) but there were things the the F (feeling) seems off and then realised that I related way more the T (thinking).  As INFJ and INTJ are very closely related, I ended up reading up on the different letters and worked out I was in fact an INTJ.  Saying that, the test isn't 100% but a good starting point if someone wants to gain self awareness."
GsAXOr715AU,"Hi Alex, today I got my job offer for the data analyst role. I am thrilled. Thank you for all the help. I followed your channel religiously and your interview tips really helped me to ace the interview. The best advice you gave was to start doing projects instead of taking class after class because I was one of those people who was focused more on taking class than to practice my skills. After watching that video of yours I started working on my projects instead. I am really grateful to you. Thank you for being part of my journey and for guiding so many people like me. I look forward to learning more from your channel."
GsAXOr715AU,"I'm not sure if i have to keep learning data analytics since I'm 40 years old 🤔
And how old are you btw 😬🙈"
GsAXOr715AU,Congrats Alex on 200K!
GsAXOr715AU,"Going to start my journey in data science, you've been a great influence ❤️"
GsAXOr715AU,Oh i missed it 😕... Im watching now!!! 👀
GsAXOr715AU,"Congrats on the 200k Alex ! Keep going 😄 
Looking good with the flat cap too"
GsAXOr715AU,Rosie stole the show 😍 We need more
GsAXOr715AU,"Hi there Alex, although I did not send in a story. You've really assisted me in getting me on the journey to Data Science. But starting from Data Analytics. SQL, Excel and now learning Python. Also been working on my soft skills such as speaking and presentation. Will be looking forward to using your suggestions doing the portfolio projects and making a profile in the coming months."
GsAXOr715AU,I can hear you alex
GsAXOr715AU,Yes
2JnlQ8jwWbE,It's good to see the other side of a glamourised profession 🤝
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Lol, the reason why i like this job is i dont need to work with people that much compared to other jobs 😅"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"We Introverts... 🤍 Everything is so relatable.. monotony, frustration, saturation... Aah sometimes it really bothers me so much that i want to quit 🥺☘️ is there anything i can do to help myself?"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Honestly I wished I watched this video before being a Data Analyst. Sometimes I wish I choose a different career.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Ha ha,love the honesty there😂😂"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Your last story is very relatable. A lot of stuff doesn’t get used or gets looked at but the person doesn’t know how to use it. And overtime they start to undervalue stuff. Like, don’t act like it’s so great that you automated  a report but a year later, nobody remembers that you saved 10 hours a week. They just get used to it.I’ve designed dashboard or coded a  complicated reports to show that we should cancel certain products or sell in  new areas or fire certain people, and then had upper management look at it and sort of shrugs their shoulders and do nothing.  You hear all these grant statements about KPI’s and valuing the business, but when you start doing it, they freeze up and go back to running on emotion"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"It’s like your husband tells he is super hungry, you rush to cook him, doing your best, and then he changes his mind at the very last moment and just orders his favorite pizza or simply goes to sleep without eating 😅!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Data cleaning means make 74 queries just to have a column
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Refreshing video.. Hit the nail on the head, love the style of direct presentation too. +1 subscriber. Thanks!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I get the part about your work never being used, even though i'm not in that line of work. 😅"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Haha love the part when he says no one looks at the report after all the effort you have put into it! Exactly Spot on!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I agree on the last part make you do the project as fast as you can aside the fact that it is paid that's why they do that kind of treatment
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Hi there sir.  Are you looking for video editor of your channel ?
2JnlQ8jwWbE,We are the same person 😂
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I feel like every pause could be replaced with a big swear word. What a polite list of hates.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,not a data analyst... yet... but definitely feel on the last point. I have so many projects that I put together spreadsheets or PPT decks and end up never being used by anyone and it infuriates me.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Thanks Alex!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"What about to be a Data Scientist, is that also for extroverts, or more for introverts? I'm also an introvert.."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"So, it has more to do with people (i. e. dealing with them) rather than the actual data analyst work?"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Can someone give suggestions which job wfh/remotely with less human interaction or job no human interaction? Im introvert, it’s hard for me😢"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Hello Alex, 

Do you have a video on the stress or work/life balance associated with being a Data Analyst? I am currently a teacher who is taking the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Or, can anyone discuss this if they are a data analyst? I understand every job/career has its difficulties.

Thank you in advance."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I appreciate what you are saying, however, for me as long as I am paid for the work that I do, the boss can do whatever he or she wants with it."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Genuinely
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I think your point over this field maybe a clear picture of every field that nothing is glamorous or satisfying, there's intense grinding, frustration, mental pains, etc. Nothing is easy come.....and that's a great lesson learning for me even I'm not an analyst now, just started preparing for it, and thanks."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Exactly lots of meetings exhaust us!!  If you get the manager who don't know abou data and database then he will exhaust you more and you will do revisions again and again!!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Thanks for sharing
Adding a summary and chapters in the video can be very beneficial for future videos."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"take a drink every time he says ""genuinely"" - you'll be trashed before the end of the video. Seriously though good content - interesting perspective, especially about the data cleaning. Thanks for sharing!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Im glad you chose social interaction as number 1! I battle with it a lot
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Think is one of your best topic. People who don't know the job think it's one of the best job because but actually as all job in the world there is bad stuffs as well
2JnlQ8jwWbE,lol
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I understand
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I feel the second last one the most. I feel like often I have to chase people down for details on some custom application or pipeline they've requested and half the time they're slow to answer or never do. 

The expectation is that down the road they'll just hand a me a list of all the stuff I already requested after the damn thing is built and now it's a huge pain to change. 

This is particularly vexing because you can see it coming. You're working on some project you know doesn't have all the pieces sorted and some point in the arbitrary future they'll ask for a laundry list of tweaks you tried to collect at the outset. 😵‍💫

And yeah. Then maybe two people use it for anything. ☠️"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I felt this. True words were spoken.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"the saccharine sweet corporate speak, being forced to use CRAP platforms like linkedin?"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I thought that I could relate to cleaning data until you said ""for 2 weeks""!  I've had several reports and projects that I've worked very hard on that have gone unused.  Nothing like being on a meeting with people asking for metrics that' are clearly on a report that I've been providing for weeks.  I recently realized that I've been trying to do data analyst tasks using only Excel and a little VBA, when there are other tools that are far more efficient like Power Query.  So I'm implementing Power Query in my current role, and learning Power BI and SQL (eventually Python) on the side to become a real data analyst.  Your videos have been extremely helpful in making the decision to pursue this, and I'm glad that you put this video out about some of the frustrations of the job."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I’m a credit analyst in a financial institution and I relate to all of this 😂

The things we hate about a job seems universal but here I am, still trying to shift to data analysis.

The worse thing about my current job is being labelled “Above Peers” during my performance review but having someone labelled @Average” be promoted instead of me..I mean…that’s basically why I’m trying to shift careers. I hated it so much I’m jumping ship."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I work as a manager in a small firm and I didn't get this problems cause I am the one asking for dara, analysing it and using it later 😅"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Hi Alex items 3-4 are, unfortunately, the reality for any kind of technical service for non-tech people - and yes it is extremely frustrating. I address it by saying to myself ""if you want N revisions because you could not spend 1 Hr agreeing on what you wanted, I will bill you for each hour required to make the revisions"". Before i let the revisions get to me because i saw that they could be avoided so easily and saw my time as ""wasted"" but now i say ""if your laziness means I have to spend N*X hours fixing it, so be so"""
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"""Let's just start with what we have, and we can change it later"" literally I felt a physical reaction in my body of ""NO"" because I know exactly what you mean. Like, please, for the love of all things holy, have a solid plan and hammer out the issues before you go forward!! The changes will grow exponentially and then foundation will be based on irrelevant content! I am a planner. I need to know all the details and I need to determine and find solutions for all the major (and prominent minor) problems before I do anything. Travel, grocery shopping, home improvement, furniture rearrangement, etc. How do people just live flying by the seat of their pants?!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Everything you described is what I hated about being a system analyst at Procter and Gamble . Made me quit the whole industry for like 13 yrs . Now I'm crawling back but I refuse to be over extended , I'm going to lay out boundaries and clear expectations. 

P. S I still have access to this whole Quickbase system I set up in 2008 . Untouched and all that private information still there smh lol"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I always say to my stakeholders: 'I don't mind the hardwork, as long that you use it.'"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Maybe the question doesn't fit perfectly to the video, but I haven't found any which is better suited: 

Do you have experiences with the SAP landscape in your environment? After my degree, I wanted to join the data world and wanted to become what I would call today a data analyst. However, I landed in the BI with SAP BW and feel now somehow enclosed in this universe. There is hardly any connection to the topics and skills covered here (data analysis, Python, SQL, etc.) and I cannot even easily translate my job description. It's like a perfect vendor lock-in and I never hear anything about SAP in any of these popular channels like yours.

Since I don't want to spend the rest of my life with clicking through SAP transactions and searching for SAP notes, I want to change my career. I assume that just switching to SAP Analytics Cloud would still have the same lock-in effect. You don't exactly work with your skills, you always just have to know more about how SAP does something imho...

It would be interesting if you have some experiences with this special world..."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Love the honesty in this video and working in Logistics I feel your PAIN ! 🤣  It's like the Wild West out there ... the Good, Bad and Ugly."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"No 1 and No 2 - Let me know when you have a solution to these
No 3 - It's better to learn to say NO and explain your reasoning behind it. I have been through those situations so many times and I can save so much of my time by just saying NO.
No 4 - This is so common, I absolutely hate this. And when it's something really urgent it's hard to understand the priority of that task because you had this exp so many times"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"As long as I'm being paid it for it, I wouldn't mind putting ini the work no one is going to use. They keep spamming me when it's going to be done, I would just make a automated reply."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,superiors/departments asking you to manipulate or even forge data so that they look better. happened to me in a couple of companies.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,hahah I can defo relate with some of this!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Your second point is so true lol.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I really feel you. I have faced all of these things. I was working on project for days to get it done on time but then meeting cancelled and no one talk about it or try to reschedule it.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Need help with cleaning data from a standard pdf invoice. I am current data analyst that works with basic invoicing and estimate.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"To me, the worst thing is when someone ask me to put the data in an Excel sheet instead of use the dashboard"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I appreciate your post on what you have put out here of what Data Analysis pertains to. Because I am a Black woman I truly must be careful of my response verbally in the workplace even moreso with the matters U brought up.  This goes for other people of color as well who want to get into this industry.  I have this video saved to review when necessary!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I think often times the requester doesn't really understand what they need, I try to get a solid understanding of the intent."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Thank you for the video Alex. I’m about to start self-learning data analytics but your comments on the social requirements are giving me pause. For context, i left a previous job for similar reasons as i was always mentally drained due to my introversion and anxiety. Could you shed more light? What goes on in these meetings? Is everyone required to speak or is it more of brainstorming or receiving tasks for the day? Is any actual work getting done during the meetings, as it’s hard for me to imagine it enduring for hours!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"As someone who has worked as an analyst for 5 years, every single one of these points resonated to me very strongly. Especially, especially the last one. ""This is incredibly important, the most important thing going on in the company. This could be industry defining. Never have we ever had a problem like this before, we must fix it. We need the data, we need the dataaaaaaahhhhh!"" then it seems like 2 weeks later there is a new ""this is the most important thing that has ever ever happened to the company. Oh that thing from 2 weeks ago, oh yeah that's important, really important but this, this is it, the most important thing ever. We need the data, we need the datttaaahhh"".  My experience has been that the only way to deal with this is learning when to give something up, learning what is the required level of quality (and this does not mean more important decisions = better quality data), and knowing that this sits on them more than it does on you, they wasted the companies money not you."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Great video! I wonder how these dislikes differ depending on whether you are an analyst in a centralized analytics dept or whether you're a solo analyst in a decentralized organizational model. I'm a decentralized analyst who used to be on a centralized team, and my feelings about data cleaning are completely different now."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,So is it a bad career path for someone who despises meetings? I’ve been working in a job for about a year where I had one 30 min scrum call a day and even that had ended up being unmanageable for me. And the scope creep was enough to give me nightmare and I’ve quit the job without another offer in hand. Can you recommend a job profile which does not have the requirement to sit in meetings for too long?
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Hello Alex
   I have specific question for entering Healthcare Data industry. I have degrees in Business & Nursing and wanted to pivot to healthcare analyst role. I see several jobs posting for SQL experience. Can you tell me which specific SQL cert I should target? Thank you"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Dude that last one is the story of my life...
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I'm looking at pursuing this career. I can't believe the water and disrespect of requesting a project be done but never actually looking at it. 

What do you guys think about creating a fake dashboard or whatever the deliverable is as a test to see if they'll actually use it before putting the months of work into it?"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Great video as always Alex. Like others I found the introverted cup emptying point interesting. As someone new to the analyst work and in particular a new organisation I have found the introverted  nature of myself and team members a challenge in terms of learning. God help me if I do end up in half day meetings!!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Alex HATES ANALYTICS and doesn't like being a DATA ANALYST!! EXPOSED!!! 😂jk

Very MUCH resonate with your first issue as a fellow introvert. 🙌🏼 I just want to play with data all day and not have to fake laugh at bad jokes. 😳"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Thank you for this video!! I’m glad I’m not the only one who has these experiences! It has sometimes been enough for me to question whether I’m in the right field. 

I’d like to add on to your last item. I did a big project for someone who wanted it urgently. I worked on it for a long time while juggling my other duties, receiving many requests for status updates. Like your project, it was never used. The next month, the person asked me to update the project with the current info. So I went back in and spent a long time redoing the project, again with many requests for status updates. Again, it wasn’t used but the following month, she wanted it updated with that month’s current info. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

How do you handle situations like that?

I’d love to see a video where you cover resources to learn soft skills like communication skills, business acumen and any other skills you think data analysts may need but aren’t always instinctual."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,It's so good knowing that I'm not the only one
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"On your last frustration, sometimes in management we have to task out minor projects of lower value to team members to keep them busy when we're slow. It keeps them working and learning while we finalize an upcoming deal. I can understand the frustration."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Hey Alex ! What's your MBTI ? 😄
2JnlQ8jwWbE,A video covering ways to overcome these would be great ! Cheers Alex
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Lol this was amazing. Doing my research to see if I’m interested in this career path. Love this! Thank you!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Hope any real practice video for data analyst!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Hello Alex! Thank you very much for sharing all of these information and knowladge about data anslysis. Hoping you will notice my comment, I have to ask you is Data Analyst a profession of the future? I would like to learn more about Excel, SQL and PowerBi in next few months and, I was wondering will market need those skills in 2023 etc. Is it worthy to invest my energy and time in learning mentioned skills?"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I super love the social aspect of my data science job. I'm a consultant, though, and you have to be comfortable with that aspect of the work."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,6 - 7 hour long meetings?? Whyyyy 😩😩😩 I hate meetings but still wanna explore this field lol!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"If I had to guess, the data cleaning frustration comes from what I call the law of logs. With any project and/or information gathering, the completion rate is very similar to a log graph. For example 0 - 30% might take 3 days then 30 - 60% takes 6 days  and 60 - 90% takes 12 days. At that point because of the exponential nature 90 - 95% could take 20 days and that's the part that starts to become frustrating. The amount of time you've spent on the last stretch is starting to equal all the time you've spent on the rest and your brain can't justify the time."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"That’s very true.. no. 1 , no. 3 and no. 4 😡😡"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Omg!!!! You nailed it!!! 💯 All.of.them!! And those dashboards that I create that no one looks at…I DELETE them from Tableau because I don’t want them coming back a year later saying…oh..I “found” this dashboard…can you tweak it to do blah…blah…blah…
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Thank you for being honest. In our certificate program all we hear is how great it is. I know it's just like any other job/career where you get the good with the bad. I already get annoyed with stuff in my classes and sometimes I just want to be like ""look, let's not act like this is the greatest thing since toilet paper."" I don't have anything against positivity but I do like honesty too."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,There is absolutely no profession I know of that doesn't have a downside. Appreciate your pointing out the flaws in the data analyst position!
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Alex is running out of content for the channel. Saw this coming😂
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I could be wrong @Alex, to me the last couple of these seem like culture / SME onboarding issues that seep into a very new industry. 

3.  No Scope / Loose Scope with frequent backend revisions
4. ""Priority"" / ""Urgent"" Projects that aren't utilized/viewed

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) can often be notoriously unaware of how unmanageable they can be and the effect this has upon the team of professionals who work around them.  

A couple ideas based on your sharing here - which I really appreciate.
Might part of a solution be to simply be data driven on the back side of a project?  

1. If this is ""urgent"", could we insert language to that effect into the scope document (or create such a document) and then continue tracking afterward to see if/how it was utilized.  

- (For at least our internal use) Did the urgency on the front end match the degree of utilization on the back end?
- If there isn't much scope on the front end how could we document this and have the stakeholder signoff on it?

2. If this seems too confrontational or unorthodox could we present this resource-enhancing idea beforehand to our lead or executive who we are most accountable to?

I have seen in my experience as an instructional designer working with SMEs that guardrails and boundaries are really helpful - exactly the same way as a highly paid consultant would deftly manage the expectations and avoid getting into a place where they are stretched too thin.

Your video *did not* come off that way at all - however reading between the lines - this was invaluable for me and other newer folks to see that SME management is always a vital part of the job - much appreciated!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Things I HATE about being a Data Analyst: MAKING PRESENTATIONS
It kills my soul slowly to take 1-2 weeks to make a 30 minutes of a presentation for people with attention span of a marshmallow."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,RELAleX🥲
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Been following you since 10k subs, watching you now uploading such kind of videos is just awesome. Answering the unanswered questions!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"""can't we save money by taking this shortcut/lazy route just for now?"" No. You cannot save money this way. You will incur a technical debt which must be repaid. With interest.
Grind my gears 😅"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Projects without boundaries, unnecessary social events, quality work not being respected, mate, you are not alone."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Hi Alex, 
Thanks for your videos. I want your thoughts about a Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.
Do u think it is good one and deserve its cost.
Thanks"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I was getting exhausted by proxy, listening to you talking about social interaction"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,needed this for my sanity - #3 definitely tops my list though
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I'm making a career pivot from a somewhat obscure academic field.  I am so used to spending literally years on something and knowing that about 12 people will read it.    I think I'll be just fine with that aspect of the job.   😂
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Man, it seems what you hate is corporate routine other than DA itself"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"I was a Data Analyst at a FAANG company for 3.5 years. I created well over a dozen supposedly ""high-priority"" dashboards in that time and I kid you not, maybe 2 of them were ever looked at or used regularly by other members of my organization. Drove me up a wall. I kept getting ""Meets All Expectations"" ratings at each performance review cycle and my manager (who couldn't write a single line of SQL btw) kept telling me that I needed to ""make more of an impact"" in order to get promoted to the next level. How was I supposed to make an impact when nobody cared about my work? So glad I'm not alone in my frustrations and experiences. Great video Alex!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"As a senior data analyst, i felt like it was me was talking in the video"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Dude, I really appreciate your sincerity and honesty behind these things. The fact that so much of one's hard work can just be cast aside is so demoralizing, but in a good light you've managed to sharpen those skills a bit further.

Thank you for your content, good or bad I look forward to learning more from you."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Who's learning data analysis?!! Who's struggling with motivation and dealing with procrastination ? Let's make a group pr something and help each other outttt
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Regarding your 4th point, after a two decades of analytics experience (marketing science at an advertising agency), I start with the mindset that my work may not be used. For me, when it's not used it's most likely it doesn't support the stakeholders proposed plans. They are quite likely to have commissioned a few pieces of analytics from different angles to back up a viewpoint or story, thus want it there to be able to pick and choose. I don't take it personally. However, knowing this, I'm always comfortable pushing back on timings. I tend to find when someone wants something today they actually need in a week or even longer."
2JnlQ8jwWbE,The feeling that I'm just a support role. A back office boy
2JnlQ8jwWbE,"Re:#4 In the Army, we called it Crisis Management. I've hated it for decades. You end up working for, then making someone else look good. Sucks!!"
2JnlQ8jwWbE,alex def made this video cuz he was mad atm
2JnlQ8jwWbE,I have been trying to choose between the data analytics certifications and the IBM data engineering certification and given your frustration of having to go back and rely on other to adjust a database just made it super clear which certification my counter-dependent self should take so I don't have to crawl out of my skin on a regular basis to ask for help.
2JnlQ8jwWbE,Samesies :)
2JnlQ8jwWbE,3 or 4 hours of putting on a face? That's impressive. My scale is in minutes.
hNTNZ00cZig,"Hello Alex, First time i watched this video someone recommended me. 
i have couple of questions please.
My first question is, I applied many places but didn't get chance to call for interview i don't know the reason.

And any website you recommend me for perfect practice SQL? Beginner to Master  
What kind of question they asked during interview for data analysis?
Thanks"
hNTNZ00cZig,Thank you for this video! StrataScratch was a HUGE help in 1) keeping my SQL skills sharp while I'm working through job applications and 2) helping me prepare for the technical interview questions. I'm able to do both of these things using the Free version of StrataScratch.
hNTNZ00cZig,"Important question please, do you recommend using this site only knowing the basics of SQL and then just learning more SQL through trial and error here ?"
hNTNZ00cZig,"(Longer comment, because this is so relevant to me right now both as an instructional designer who's added data analysis to the mix:) 
After having my first couple of technical interviews, this is invaluable @Alex.  Candidly, this is a completely different world from an artificial environment such as a DataCamp or other fill-in-the-blank approach.  Filling in blanks does not teach our brains to demonstrate the real-world competency that our future team is depending on from us :)

In learning engineering lingo, we call this disconnect the difference between the ""learning context"" vs. the real-world ""performance context"".  The goal of solid training is to first teach the basics but ensure that learners demonstrate mastery (whether basic or advanced) in a real world context.  In the case of those of us who want jobs in this field it will be necessary to communicate what is going on in our brains just as you do in this video.  To be super transparent with you and others reading this... In my first such interview I candidly felt like a 2nd grader learning phonics and sounding out words... which was an unpleasant feeling to put it mildly.

Having to ""talk through"" a completely new SQL problem in real-time is very much a performance, and having a way to simulate this in real-time would be helpful.   
You demonstrated this competency in this video, and that helps to a significant degree. Some sort of service or ""fishbowl"" style masterclass could also accomplish this.  

The ""community answers"" feature in StrataScratch is new and very helpful as there is more than one solution to these issues.  Live ""Fishbowl"" style webinars (one person answers while others observe) or even asynchronous video submissions which could be reviewed within 72 hours or whenever could provide invaluable feedback in addition to forcing us to go through the real life situation that most job seekers will face."
hNTNZ00cZig,"You know nothing about SQL, you can't think of structuring queries and your queries are not correct at all. And you do this youtube channel for only money and give people false information."
hNTNZ00cZig,Is it possible to get data analytics remote internship?
hNTNZ00cZig,"Check out Nate's channel, as well: he explains the queries very well. Glad to see this collab."
hNTNZ00cZig,"Hi Alex, I have a request for a video please do a review on the WGU masters in data analytics"
hNTNZ00cZig,"@Alex the Analyst Have you looked at Comptias new Data+ Cert, its got a load of stuff to practice and read and also video instructor lectures. I bought access so if you wanted to take a look into it let me know."
hNTNZ00cZig,"Hi Alex, 
Wanted an insight on what is better to learn, MySQL or Microsoft SSMS, in terms of two aspects: Industry Usage and Software Environment?"
hNTNZ00cZig,I joined this morning and was able to do most of the easy ones.
hNTNZ00cZig,THANK YOU !!!
hNTNZ00cZig,"This is amazing Alex, thanks for this🙏."
hNTNZ00cZig,I am beginning to lose hope.  I have submitted over 100 applications and haven't reached the interview stage yet.
hNTNZ00cZig,"Alex! Thanks so much for reviewing our platform! I'm glad you found the platform helpful and I hope others do too. As you mentioned there are 50+ questions that are free. We also try to release in-depth data science articles almost daily...which are also free! So hopefully there's something for everyone. 

Love your channel. It's been amazing seeing your channel grow from what it was a few years ago to what it is now."
hNTNZ00cZig,"Just curious, why do we need the SELECT before the ABS?"
hNTNZ00cZig,Thanks for the video.  Attention: you need to register even to get the freemium capabilities.
hNTNZ00cZig,"The preview feature is superrrr useful for me. I used to practise MySQL in HackerRank, LeetCode, and InterviewQuery, three of them don't have a preview and run the code to check the result."
hNTNZ00cZig,Awesome stuff Alex - would you say being comfortable with medium-difficulty StrataSratch SQL questions is the bare minimum requirement (for the SQL portion) to be qualified to apply for data analyst jobs?
hNTNZ00cZig,"I have a tech inteview with a SQL assessment tomorrow, perfect timing. Been using leetcode but I'll check this out too. Thanks for this Alex"
hNTNZ00cZig,The perfect video I could have asked for ever 😁😁😁
hNTNZ00cZig,"Hey Alex ...
Happy to see you back!"
hNTNZ00cZig,"Could you make a video on one of the interview question ""What is your salary expectation?"""
hNTNZ00cZig,Great video!
hNTNZ00cZig,This channel is becoming above and beyond many others. Good work.
hNTNZ00cZig,"Great shout-out Alex! Nate from Stratascratch really deserves it! I've been using his website and also watching videos from his youtube channel sharing hist approach to solve some of the questions, that help me improve my skills in SQL and prepare to technical interviews."
hNTNZ00cZig,Great Video! I’m glad I’m not the only person that thinks leetcode is exceptionally difficult lol.
hNTNZ00cZig,"Hello Alex, you are just the best. Your videos are really timely for me. Help when I need it. Watching this now."
hNTNZ00cZig,Can you make a video on how to get remote data analyst jobs
hNTNZ00cZig,I am right now looking for an internship and you could not have done a better video for me !! Im also following you since few months and your content is such a gold mine for Master and Msc students getting ready to jump into the business. Thank you very much Alex !
hNTNZ00cZig,"Noooo, I just did a technical interview yesterday and I'm far beyond prepared 😂"
hNTNZ00cZig,I watch Nate's video too. Very useful
hNTNZ00cZig,Could have really used this a few weeks back before I finally got an internship 😅😅 would have saved me so much time. Still gonna be useful for the future tho 🤓
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok choy! Haha man, for some reason, the thought of hard work brings tears to my eyes too."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Boy chok!!
Hi Alex. Greate content. Done with my portfolio projects and looking forward to starting my resume.
What are my chances in getting a remote work while being in Africa ??"
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy, I'm still working on my bachelor's degree and looking to work through your videos for a career change into data analytics. Your videos keep me motivated to move forward and push through to make this big change."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy! I love you bro! Absolutely loving working from home, 3rd year running since Feb 2000. I also like the flexibility and time spent with family. I work a lot more hours but its not as bad. I also love the no commuting thing. Btw Feb 2020 and Mar 2021 I used one tank of fuel, half of it to run the engine to keep it functional. Remote anytime. Watching a year later LOL!"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,I hope your day is paked with bok choy (joy)
gz2j5NBESSs,You made this video 11 mo ago. I'm still watching. 👍
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok choy - I love you and awesome vegetable choice!
This is probably my first ever Youtube comment throughout my entire viewing history as I don't often feel motivated to comment. However, I wanted to thank you for all that you do - you've been such a great resource to me when I first made the decision to pivot into data analytics! I've watched almost all of your tutorial videos along my DA journey and honestly you are the reason I am still motivated to continue on this path. Thanks again and keep up the good work!"
gz2j5NBESSs,"Hey, Absolutely Love you. I just started following you and have learned a great deal from your content. I'm going to watch all of your videos keep up the good work."
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you... Bok Choy :)
gz2j5NBESSs,"Boy Choy is absolute heaven, as is working remote. Thanks, Alex!"
gz2j5NBESSs,Box choy
gz2j5NBESSs,Starting to binge your videos! I had my fist interview for a data scientist role today and it went so well 🥬🥬🥬🥬
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy!!!! Thank you so much for creating this content! I have a similar story as you! I was working as a mental health technician in the military and decided to pursue my master's in social work. However, I have 2 kids and I am military spouse now. I have been doing a lot of research and realized it made more financial sense to break into the tech field. I really enjoy hearing your perspective and I am really exciting to start learning!

p.s. you should totally do podcasts! lol 

p.p.s. I love you! :-) I love that you said that you're signing off so many times and then you hang around longer! I do the same thing! haha"
gz2j5NBESSs,"From Greece, is it possible to find remote job in US or serious European countries like Germany or Netherlands??"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy my dude
gz2j5NBESSs,BOK CHOY!! You don't know how you are being a blessing and helpful in our careers. Thank you Alex for this resource.
gz2j5NBESSs,"Working from home sounds appealing for multiple reasons, but for me, I'll be even more socially isolated if I work from home, which I think will take a toll on me.  Not having others in close proximity that I can get help from or worth together on a problem with would be another problem for me.  There are a lot of ways to communicate with co-workers thanks to modern technologies, but it's not quite a replacement to having someone physically nearby.  I'm also not sure I can focus as well if I'm at home.  I'd actually have to try it to be able to know, but those are my immediate concerns.

Not having to commute sounds heavenly though."
gz2j5NBESSs,Yes! Driving in Dallas is a pain. Main reason i want to shift to remote.
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy 4 weeks late but here we are 🤙
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you.
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy!! I have been watching your video's for awhile. It's been one of the main reason I took an online courses for Data Analytics. I had been working in sustainability field and realized early on in the course how SQL, in addition to various functions in Excel,  would have reduced the number of hrs. wasted on daily and weekly projects. I'm still anxious about looking for a career in data analytics, but both your technical and topic's video's give me inspiration when I falter. Thanks"
gz2j5NBESSs,"I've never had bok choy - might try it at some point now.

Alex, do you think you would feel differently about working remotely if you were just starting at your current company? Do you think there is more value in going into the office everyday for more junior analysts in terms of building good habits and getting acclimated easier."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Put your plaque up there!! We feel a connection to your success so in a way we are proud of it too. (And of course, we love you! )"
gz2j5NBESSs,"I can vouch for Alex’s advice on how to get started in the field. I followed all his advice, including resume set-up, professional certifications, online portfolio of work, which technical skills to focus on… I don’t even have an undergrad degree yet. (I’m working on it though) I just accepted an offer to work at a global corporation as a Data Analyst even though I have less than 2 years experience working in a role you could argue was related to data analytics if you squinted really hard.  But, partially due to Alex’s advice, I interviewed well, and had a portfolio and resume that was impressive for a fresher so I got the job. And it’s a high-paying job, too! 

The way I see it, getting a job in data analytics is the beginning of my learning and hard work, not the end of it. Now that I am in the field properly, it’s on me to keep growing and learning!"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!!! Can't wait to watch all your videos! 😁
gz2j5NBESSs,"I might be outlier here, but i am more for hybrydwork 2-3 days onsite. After matleave they changed my role, so recently when I was in the oofice, we now have to go hybryd i noticed how much info i am missing out by being isolated remote. My commune is very reasonable, and i enjoy dressing up for work. I also think women are less productive wfh, because of all other responsibilities they traditionally have that kind of blend into the workday."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Hey Alex!! Thank you so much for all of your content. This video is super helpful for me at this time. I just received two offers for a position as a data analyst! One of them is fully in office with the opportunity to work part time remotely later down the line. The other is hybrid starting off and fully remote - capable if I choose. I wanted to thank you for all of your content and hard work. You have helped me tremendously. For any other job seekers here, keep going. I finished the Google Data Analytics Course two months ago and I am currently taking Fundamentals of Excel for Data Visualization (also through Coursera). I am planning to continue taking courses throughout my entire career. Emphasizing my desire to continue learning new skills and advancing the ones I already have played a huge part in me getting offers. I didn't talk much about it in the first couple of interviews that I had. But when I did finally start talking about it companies definitely took note. Thanks again, Alex. I truly appreciate you."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy!
I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Commercial Music. I was working at a small business music retailer, and in October, I began the Google Data Analytics certificate after checking out your review for it. I finished at the beginning of February, just in time for the store I worked at to close its doors. After following your videos on portfolio projects, resume-building, and 2 months of job hunting, I am ecstatic to say that I accepted my first offer for an analyst job today! I don’t think I would have had the confidence to go for this career change without having come across your channel. You really are doing the lord’s work. Thank you so much, Alex."
gz2j5NBESSs,Love u bok Choy!!!
gz2j5NBESSs,"I've watched your entire video, I loved it and I love you! 
I'm watching you from Spain and I'm in the middle of the Google certificate. I know it's not the most popular profession here yet, but I'm ready for the long run!
Keep up the good work, you're helping many people!"
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you.... Feels a bit weird saying it though
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy mate !!!!!
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you man
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy! You inspire me so much !the plaque won’t look tacky . It shows how much this community has grown I remember when it was way lower! Congrats !
gz2j5NBESSs,I really learned a lot
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok fucking Choy!!!!! This channel is amazing, I've binge watched a ton of your videos and started taking courses you've recommend. Completed the Google Data Analytics Certification just last week. Took some of the excel courses on your recommendation and built a massively time saving macro from my team as a result! Been working from home from the past 2 years and LOVE it. Do you reckon it would be possible to start off as an entry level data analyst (which is my plan) and work from home. Realistically do you need to be in the office so you can ask somebody when you get an error message in SQL ....which I assume happens every 5 seconds when your are new. Would a company even allow an entry level analyst work from home do you reckon?

Anyway keep up the good work, your videos are incredible and inspiring!

Mike"
gz2j5NBESSs,I SENT YOU AN EMAIL FOR AWHILE NOW TO YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT BUT GOT NO RESPONSE FROM YOU........................ ALEX
gz2j5NBESSs,"Hey Alex, 

I'm working as HR professional for past 3 years. Now I'm looking into IT sector. Suggest me some courses without coding with a good future career path with good salary package. 

Note: I'm not well with maths.

Thanks in Advance 
Note:"
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you ❤ And I will accept a data analyst themed haiku as a show of your reciprocal appreciation.
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy
gz2j5NBESSs,"I love you, Alex! (just watched the most recent video again)

Thank you for impassioning the next generation of data analysts/data heads!"
gz2j5NBESSs,"bok choy, yes delicious. love all the content. I've watched all the job prep videos since last year after getting the google data analytics cert after my masters in business analytics. I changed careers from healthcare and just accepted a remote position as a data analyst with a great company! thank you for all your help and inspiration!"
gz2j5NBESSs,I just landed my first Data Analyst job on Friday! I just found out it is fully remote so this was some great information for me! Thanks!
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy! No idea what kinda veg this is but uhmm! Thank you Alex for everything you've contributed to all of us
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you 😊
gz2j5NBESSs,"I’ve been following your videos for a while now please I need you to help with an answer to my question 
Can I work remotely for a company in USA from Nigeria?"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy. I'm here
gz2j5NBESSs,"Great video...very enlightening!
Have you used SAS Viya?"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy…is good in ramen. I am currently a teacher. I have been taking the Google Data Analytics certificate program on Coursera thanks to you. My goal is to move from education to data analytics. Thanks for your content!!! BTW I love you!
gz2j5NBESSs,"I really loved this video! I've been watching the channel for about a month and have found it to be such a great resource. I really feel like remote work has opened up the field to me, and this list really helped me reinforce that it's the right choice for me. 

I've been thinking about what I want to grown in my vegetable garden and Bok Choy has come up quite a bit, especially for more shaded area. Love all the hard work you put into the channel and all your encouragement. Love ya Alex!"
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy is awesome! Hey Alex new here!  I've been working remote 6 years and I actually quit my last job because they wanted people back in the office.  Sad that it took a pandemic to make working remote the norm, but it's such a great work style.  I've been on a 6 year streak and I don't intend to go back to the office!"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy great video
gz2j5NBESSs,"My boomer boss just doesn’t get it. We’ve been back in the office for nearly 2 years, full time. We worked remote for 1 month. We can’t find good talent because the salary isn’t great + we’re 9-5 M-F, butt in the seat. I’m doing the Google data cert now. I have a bachelors in Econ & finance / startup experience. Really looking to transition out of this dated place sooner than later."
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!! I love you.. 😁
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,Bokchoy. Being with the family and kids is the best perk of remote work.
gz2j5NBESSs,"BAWWWWWWWK (Bok) CHOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYY! Appreciative of your videos as always. Trying to apply for a Data Analyst position on my team even though the odds are stacked against me since someone else is eyed for that position but still want to get my name in there and on the radar for future potential. Thanks for all your tips, I've been running through them and working hard on other courses and certifications I heard from you. Austin, TX is turning into a great place for DAs so I'm hoping to stay here."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok choy!!! I have been working since 2019 fully 100% remote and I just started a data analyst position 1 month ago, let me tell you that you were the one who provided a lot of insides on what to expect on a real life job. So far excel, tableau desktop, server, prep and sql are most of my tools, still working on them. For the other readers I decided to start all over again at my 34 years, I was in the supply chain for 6 years but got tired of it. It is never too late to start and  go for your dream job!!! Keep hustling guys!!”"
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy and I truly Love you.
Thank you for your dedication In bringing these videos to us,i won't say I have watched all but I binge watch most through out the day .
Thank you for real"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok choy! I love working remote, I save time on commute!!"
gz2j5NBESSs,"And Free love, too! Lol.
What was great about this video was I needed a reality check. 
I found your videos when researching to get into a new opportunity. No, several months later, it is starting to grind on me a bit. But I know it will be worth it in the long run. 
Have focused in on my industry and a company I am passionate about. Have the area where I can make the biggest impact dialed in. Have submitted a ton of resumes and had a bunch of interviews for various positions. Just haven’t nailed it or I haven’t found the right magical combination of my experience and there needs. But today’s video gave me just the right amount of hope and optimism. 
Thanks. And for the love."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Crying and Bok Choy ?!? Lol. And Rosie. Yeah, I’m here for the long haul."
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok choy, man. Thanks for sharing your experience"
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you another great video Alex
gz2j5NBESSs,"Hi Alex!! Been watching your videos for a while now and I wanted to thank you because they've been a huuuge help not just to improve and broaden my technical skills, but also to prepare much better for job interviews.
I'm currently finishing my Bachelor's and starting an MSc in Data Science in the upcoming september, so I'm looking for an entry-level position to start in the analytics sector. 
I've already done some interviews and I can tell you that your content has been a boost to my job-landing chances, really appreciate what you're doing!

By the way, I love you bro ;)"
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy! I know you love me, Alex! I am very grateful for every single video that you have posted and I love your style. Keep up the good work!"
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy!  I'm 40 and met my wife at the office when we were 25 and she was the receptionist.  Negative with regard to remote work for you single guys/gals, you won't experience the pleasures (and drama) of office romances ALA Jim and Pam from The Office.   I LOVE YOU bro and I love my wife!!!"
gz2j5NBESSs,"BOK CHOY! Great commentary. I worked from home for two years in an analytics department for a hospital, and I'm five weeks in to an operational role onsite at the hospital. I'm that gearhead who is so excited to be driving a cool car to and from work! Because so many healthcare colleagues work in person, and now I work in an operational role, I feel a huge sense of satisfaction in being more connected. When I was remote in my old role, I only felt connected to the kind of leaders who spent a lot of time in our data tools."
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy brother! Thanks for shooting the shit with us
gz2j5NBESSs,"Jalapeno BOK CHOY!!! In here like swimwear lol. Started watching a couple of weeks ago, definitely ready my new career! Still watching, I love you! And come on...that accent 😂"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!!!
gz2j5NBESSs,"Little do these bok choys know, 20% of the video is after the vegetable of the day. :D

Also, I fully acknowledge I'm in the minority but personally, the pandemic has been the best thing to ever happen to me in my professional life.

P.S.: I love you, Alex. 😂"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy baby! I LOVE YOU Bro.
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy! I’m less than a week away from my first day at my new Data Analyst job! I’m so excited! I’m self taught developer/data analyst and your videos helped me learn so much and prepare for this wonderful new chapter in my life. I totally agree, there is a high correlation in watching your videos all the way through and getting your first job! Thanks Alex!"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy! :D you always make an impact sorry for not commenting on other videos of yours will do in all of em :D
gz2j5NBESSs,bok choy
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!
gz2j5NBESSs,"Bok Choy !!great content as always , the channel is a gold mine"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bokchoy!!
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you Alex! Thank you for all of the meaningful content you share with us!
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,Watched for 48 min 49 sec while doing cardio. It was enjoyable.
gz2j5NBESSs,"I find it funny that people forget lots of things were not normal before they became normal. 8 hour work days, law for kids to go to school, cell phones, face masks - these are all ideas that at one point had been considered abnormal. Oddly enough once the complaining stopped, things became normal and here we are.

Remote work is not bad, it is not good ether. It just is different. I personally like hybrid model. I like to go in a couple days (Monday and Thursday are my personal picks). I just like to meet with colleagues and talk or sync various projects face to face."
gz2j5NBESSs,"I love you, dude."
gz2j5NBESSs,bok choy
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy!!!
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy for the win 😁😁!! I LOVE working remote for all the reasons you mentioned. I also am an aspiring data analyst but my background is in languages. Got a PhD in linguistics so I will have to work hard on mastering those technical skills. But your videos give me hope ☺ And I LOVE hope ❤
gz2j5NBESSs,I love you my dude!  Bok Choy! I'm still learning from your videos! Much appreciated! Thanks for your videos!!! Hope I can break into the field soon!
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy! Recently learned about your channel. Im a warehouse worker trying to switch careers and I feel like a found some guidance from you which I haven't ever felt in college.
gz2j5NBESSs,"I love you, I feel like I should be committed lol 🎉"
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok Choy!
gz2j5NBESSs,"What are the best states, cities or counties to work remotely from preferably states with no/low income tax?"
gz2j5NBESSs,bok choy
gz2j5NBESSs,Bok choy! Starting an analyst course today!
opJgMj1IUrc,"Is the GitHub link to download the excel dataset still valid?

I have been trying to download since yesterday but it's not working. Could you please update the links to the the data set for this boot camp 🙏"
opJgMj1IUrc,Hey can you send this excel shit????
opJgMj1IUrc,"It's a great project, but I have some issues. The last pivot table is not working for me with the exact data set. I hope you make an update video........"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Thanks so much for this great tutorial! 
The sorting issue can be beautifully solved through custom lists, as follows:
Use a Custom List in Excel
Go to File → Options → Advanced.

Scroll to General and click Edit Custom Lists.

Add a custom sort order:
0-1 Miles, 1-2 Miles, 2-5 Miles, 5-10 Miles, 10+ Miles
In your Pivot Table, apply a Sort → More Sort Options → Custom List."
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you so much for these great tutorials. It is really great to watch the great tips and job situation solutions  that you provide to us. Perfect bootcamp serie and perfect lecturer.
opJgMj1IUrc,"Lesson#27:  Conclusion
Steps involved in Creating a full project for Analysis in Excel :
1. Data Cleaning 
2. Creating Pivot Tables 
3. Creating Charts based on Pivot tables
4. Creating Final Dashboard for Visualization
5. Adding slicers to filter through the visulaization"
opJgMj1IUrc,"I have a question instead of using nested if(statements) can we we IFS for multiple arguments?
if Yes ! Than what is the best-case senario for using Nested If & IFS"
opJgMj1IUrc,Finally Completed the Excel series and learned major things and i think its a very quick and concise excel course for data analytics to get started
opJgMj1IUrc,Pls can u teach me how to download the dataset on github
opJgMj1IUrc,I completed this on 2nd August 2025🎉
opJgMj1IUrc,"Thank you so much Alex
God bless you"
opJgMj1IUrc,Hope this helps me out in this summer 2025
opJgMj1IUrc,"12:50 I couldn't stop laughing when you saw that error 😆 
thanks a lot for your videos Alex, I'm pursuing a Data Analyst job after finishing college 💫"
opJgMj1IUrc,done
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you Alex ❤
opJgMj1IUrc,Thanks Alex You are the best ever ❤❤
opJgMj1IUrc,Can i still watch this If i am aiming for financial analyst job
opJgMj1IUrc,"can seem to find the dataset bike dashboard
. can you please assist me"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Hi Alex! I just discovered your channel and I’m so glad I did—it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for. I’m following along with your tutorial, but I’m stuck on the part where you create the formula for the new “age bracket” column. I can’t seem to get the second part of the formula (for the “Middle Aged” and “Old” brackets) to work, no matter how much I slow the video down or rewind. Any tips on how I can troubleshoot this—or improve at writing these kinds of formulas—would be super helpful. Thanks again for all the value you’re providing!"
opJgMj1IUrc,"personally I really like the spontanious and trial error things, it gives the icebreak and laugh effect little bit 😆. thanks alot alex. salam from Indonesia"
opJgMj1IUrc,How can I publish this online?
opJgMj1IUrc,"Completed it today. Definitely need more business context to understand whats happening, but a good start. He has his randomness of trying things out and always come back fixed. Truly a pro. Did my slicers and yeah need more practice ahahahahaha"
opJgMj1IUrc,in nested if part can i use IFS in my table???
opJgMj1IUrc,18:44
opJgMj1IUrc,"Hello, I want to make a project, who has passed the financial analysis?"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Sir Alex thanks so much, I Gained A lot from this full project in excel, But sir how do we get a prepared database to be used just like you did in this video?"
opJgMj1IUrc,8:35 What was the hotkey used to copy all those values down like that?
opJgMj1IUrc,"At 23:00, you can right-click the row label you want to sort and choose ""Move Up"" or ""Move Down"" to reorder the categories manually. This helps organize ranges like mileage in a more logical way. Thanks for the video!"
opJgMj1IUrc,The 10+ Miles replacement you originally suggested worked for me. I did Control H on the working data sheet and refreshed the data in the Pivot table tab / PivotTable Analyze refresh. Try again.
opJgMj1IUrc,Great work done!
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank u very much ALEX👍
opJgMj1IUrc,"for some reason in the beginning when we make the pivot table and I tried to hit Command A to select all to transfer from the work sheet it would not let me do it, so I had to manually drag to the last column and row to do it. why is that. its not hard to manually do it but was wondering why can't I do it the easier way?"
opJgMj1IUrc,"I like this type of learning method. It’s not perfect, it shows you that you’ll encounter mistakes while also teaching you to find solutions and keep improving. Thank you, Alex!"
opJgMj1IUrc,Pls can ypu share the link fpr the raw data
opJgMj1IUrc,Pls where can i get the raw data
opJgMj1IUrc,"What an explanation, You nailed it Alex."
opJgMj1IUrc,"Hello! in 28:31 , how can renaming the ""Age Bracket"" values like adding 31-35 to Middle Age can affect the graph even if it depends on the count of purchased? I am confused"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Thanks Alex! If anyone is following the Web version, it's best to put the pivot tables, graphs, and slicers all in the dashboard and then hide the tables. For some reason, you can't make slicers from charts nor copy pivot tables between sheets as of writing this (and as far as i have found). however, if you've found a workaround that works (some didn't work for me), please reply with it :)"
opJgMj1IUrc,whats the name of this project ?
opJgMj1IUrc,"5:09 min I changed first to Female, is changed ok. But when changing to Male it messed up. if I do it first male and then female is ok. Why?"
opJgMj1IUrc,I want to work as a data analysis. I refuse to do other things.
opJgMj1IUrc,"10:30 why shouldn't we use ""Ifs"" like =Ifs(L2<32, ""Adolescent"", L2>=32, ""Middle Age"")

instead of using =if( if())"
opJgMj1IUrc,"I can't thank you enough Alex for the great work your are doing. I really appreciate it.

For those going through this in 2025 and using the latest version of excel, if you encounter any problem writhing the IF formulas this is because there has been some changes in the syntax for writing  IF and IFS formulas in excel. 
Try this IFS formula to fix the problem
=IFS(L2<31; ""Adolescent"";  L2<54; ""Adult""; L2>=54; ""Old"")
Or simply use semi colons instead of commas, as used in the video."
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you so much Alex. Im improving day by day towards Data analyst role.
opJgMj1IUrc,Great project demo! I like how you encounter and adapt to issues on the fly during the tutorial. It is very reflective of scenarios one will encounter during a work task.
opJgMj1IUrc,How are you filling up columns without pulling the cursor UpTo the last cell in a column? For example at 10:54
opJgMj1IUrc,"THANK YOU
:>"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Please i love him, he's funny ""don't do that"""
opJgMj1IUrc,Good looking out bro 🔥
opJgMj1IUrc,"I'm finding it hard downloading the dataset from GitHub 
Please I need assistance
Thanks"
opJgMj1IUrc,My second pivot table does not return the count how can i solve that
opJgMj1IUrc,21:30 - You can just drag it down buddy
opJgMj1IUrc,"what to do about blanks, idk why I downloaded the same dataset but I have so many blanks in this dataset?
could anyone please guide me in this"
opJgMj1IUrc,thank you alex this was fun !!!
opJgMj1IUrc,"Thank you alex for this amazing series your way of explanation is commendable :)
by this playlist I am one step closer to my dream job of data analysis :) 
keep it up 😊"
opJgMj1IUrc,That was super fun!Thankyou Alex.
opJgMj1IUrc,One of the finest advise I got from my CFO when working on a large excel sheet was to standardize the format of numbers. Select the entire sheet and bring it to zero decimal place.  I still do it :)
opJgMj1IUrc,Hello sir could you please share the link of the excel sheet ?
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you Alex. It helped me a lot in my journey to Data Analyst.
opJgMj1IUrc,How do I download the data sheet?
opJgMj1IUrc,"( really cheesed that i am able to come back to say this:) ).   the very first time i stumbled across your page, i checked the comments and saw that a few people got their first data analyst jobs after watching and following your bootcamp -- and i wanted to be among those people. long story short, i got my first job last week as a data analyst and it is because of you and your ceaseless contribution. thank you so very much for your helpful and detailed videos!"
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you so much Alex😍😍😍
opJgMj1IUrc,Your dad is not old and you are no longer adolescent! 😛 Ask any teenager 😉 You are a handsom early-middle-aged. Great video anyway.
opJgMj1IUrc,I need this project
opJgMj1IUrc,Hello Alex. I have a Doubt that I'm not able to press enter even if i wrote the correct statement of if. Why does that happen. its showing an error showing a pop up.
opJgMj1IUrc,WHY IS THIS SO FUN? OMG I NEVER THOUGHT EXCEL WOULD BE THIS FUN
opJgMj1IUrc,In the line chart for Age brackets to add the values for each age bracket just edit each field in the pivot chart after each name adolescents put 0-31 Middle Aged put 32-53 old put 54 Plus  This will just add the numbers to the titles.  don't try and change the worksheet.
opJgMj1IUrc,"Alex, you just raise my confidence to peak. Thank you so much."
opJgMj1IUrc,I just finished the series. Thank you so much! Can you make a new series for intermediate users?
opJgMj1IUrc,"Just love the way you teach Alex ❤. Specially, the funny jokes and comedy that you make intermittently during the lecture gives a kind of refreshment 😆"
opJgMj1IUrc,Quick question; my 2016 home of office does not have pivot table capability since its home edition.  What can I do creating the visuals?
opJgMj1IUrc,36:36 is confusing i do not have that many pivot table
opJgMj1IUrc,"why do i need to do that age bracket thing can you reply please i didnt fully understand, why line chart created ?"
opJgMj1IUrc,Currently working on a Mac how do I press Control when creating the pivotal table ? both the command key and control key are not working any advice  ?
opJgMj1IUrc,"Really Really good video alex, thankyou very much"
opJgMj1IUrc,This is a fantastic channel. Thank you
opJgMj1IUrc,Please Can you make your videos clear even after I zoom in it's blurry
opJgMj1IUrc,"Merci beaucoup expert,
Nous sollicitons la version françaises si possible, Merci"
opJgMj1IUrc,"30:32 At the Dashboard on the first pasting of the first chart, the line thing happen to me too and I have no idea why it does that either, lol"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Great job you did Mr Alex
Thank you!"
opJgMj1IUrc,Which version of Microsoft Excel did you use? Because I am not able to access the insert slicer
opJgMj1IUrc,thank you
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you so much Alex.
opJgMj1IUrc,Where can I get the data set to use pls
opJgMj1IUrc,just completed excel in this bootcamp very helpful
opJgMj1IUrc,Why is my pivot table showing blank for its columns  ?
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank You Sir!
opJgMj1IUrc,I so much love your tutorials. Thank you very much for this opportunity
opJgMj1IUrc,Thank you so much Alex for guiding us step by step through the project
opJgMj1IUrc,Alex!!!!!! This is so Amazing!!!! You deserve a hug from me to you!!!! Thank you for making my learning process easy. Much Appreciated.
opJgMj1IUrc,"Thank you so much Alex i now understand excel better, your videos are amazing"
opJgMj1IUrc,God bless you Alex....i just created my first project as a data analyst.... i feel like throwing a party
opJgMj1IUrc,was fun to do
opJgMj1IUrc,"22.48 you can easily drag columns in the pivot tables, no need to change the name"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Alex your a good mentor for me learning Basic Excel to study Data Analyst.😃

I follow all your session. Thank you very much you are a great Man.🫡"
opJgMj1IUrc,"At 28:29, it was a good idea and you did the right thing. The pivot table wasn't sorted anymore after refreshing (mine did the same thing). All you had to do was sort it A-Z again and it would be fine :)"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Please, i just started learning excel. I was following but i can't find the slicer part at the end in my excel sheet. Please what xan be the reason, i also can't edit the chart😢"
opJgMj1IUrc,"Kudos for a job well done sir.
I have a little problem though. I am unable to access the worksheet. The GitHub page returns a blank page/document. I don't know if it's a general issue or if it's just me..."
opJgMj1IUrc,You’re amazing 🎉
opJgMj1IUrc,How i upload my xlsx project on linkedIn?
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Thanks for bringing more attention to communication skills in the field of data, Alex!"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hello Alex, great content man. I'm not sure if you already mentioned this in another video but I was wondering if you have recommendations for data analytics newsletters, books or websites. Cheers!"
yRWkSKRYCaI,Hi Alex. Your video is useful for a newbie for me. Is there any book for improving communication skill ? I am pretty ok at tech & problem solving but I feel nervous and anxiety when talking to anyone.
yRWkSKRYCaI,Thank you!
yRWkSKRYCaI,"When I was a software QA analyst I was faulted by several bosses for not being a good communicator, but NOBODY explained what I was supposed to do, or how!"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"I'm 34 and wanting to Change Career path's. I've been in Sales all my life and want to enter the Data Analyst Field ,but my concern that my age could be a problem. My wife is a web developer and is very supportive on this change. Hope my age won't be a problem getting an entry-level Data analyst position"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hey Alex. Thanks a ton for great content. 
I’m going to start my preparation of being a data analyst by following your vidoes. Hoping I’ll make you proud some day!"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"What is the max rage where a Data analyst won’t go far in career advance if he/she doesn’t have a degree,which I mean only finished secondary school.

As getting into data analyst doesn’t required a degree and the first hardest challenge is to step into getting the first job without a higher education to gain experience but most of the jobs it says higher diploma required at least.

What difficulties went through in career as data analyst without a higher education or degree,

Any foreigners with 3-6 years of experience as data analyst landed a job offer in United States without a higher education or degree 

If there is anyone would like to share their personal experience would love to hear that."
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Great video, thank you! Would you be able to talk more about being a data analyst specifically within healthcare and how this differs from other industries?"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hi Alex, I'm an industrial engineering student graduating next year and got really interested in the field of data. I've been researching data analytics and data science and trying to figure out which one I should focus on. While studying I currently work at a marketing agency and work with the analytics for Google ads, Facebook ads,  and Google Analytics. Would you recommend me to focus on learning the data analytics part, or the data science part?  I want to combine industrial engineering knowledge with data skills to really stand out in my career."
yRWkSKRYCaI,The cautionary statement about over-committing oneself really hit home… 😵‍💫😞 An ongoing challenge that I need to better dissect & manage ✅ (Still binging your content 🙃 & another huge THANK YOU🙏🏾).
yRWkSKRYCaI,"I never even go on Youtube unless it's to watch your videos 😭 thanks for all the tutorials, lessons you made it's been truly helpful!! Learned so much so thanks again😊"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Thanks Alex, the ability of understanding that business needs is so crucial."
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hi Alex! I know that a lot of people tell you that how much your videos helped them get their first job as an analyst, but I would like to thank you so much for your content which tremendously helped me in getting my first analyst job! Your portfolio, interview questions, and just general information about data analysts were what got me into the analyst job. Again, thank you for doing the service."
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hey! I need to know, currently self learning Data analytics and Data science and can actually use SQL,Python,Excel and Tableau efficiently also can currently take on any job but must job on linked in requires certification in computer science or related courses.. is there a way for me to get an Entry job or I need to get degrees?? I have a degree in Civil Engineering by the way"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hello, I wanted to know if a certain certificate is great having. It’s “The Tableau Data Analytics Certificate” it is pathstream patterning with tableau and the course is online with NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Seems good just wanted a bit of insight if possible"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hi Alex , how are you?
Can you help us in building resume for Data Analyst job."
yRWkSKRYCaI,Don't communication fall under interpersonal skills?
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Nice content as always.
Please what video editing software do you use for your videos.
I love how your videos look always."
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hi Alex, 
would you please be able to a video on the best desktop set up for data analyst"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"I am from Sales/Customers relations domain and got an exp. of around 10 years. But now I want to change my profession, so continued with my studies and passed CMA & M. Com. Now going to start Google data analytics certification. I am happy that communication&relationship building are already part of my life. Your videos are really worth watching & inspiring. ""Learning never ends""😊"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"This was a very well thought out video. Some good things to talk to kids about at age appropriate times, too."
yRWkSKRYCaI,"I’m currently working on getting my Salesforce administrator and platform app builder. 

$200 for the certification"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Thank you so much for this video! I've always enjoyed learning the more technical bits of data analyzing, but the first half of the google course is just such an insufferable grind for me.... So wish they could've made the communication bit as simple as this video haha~ Great stuff!"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Thanks for the video Alex, I've been waiting for it for a while now. The only skill which I think doesn't really belong here is Business Acumen, since not all the time we could choose our employer and domain, so I think it's also sometimes also a matter of luck."
yRWkSKRYCaI,I explored your channel very late but get obsess with your informative videos thanks!!!
yRWkSKRYCaI,Do you think someone with social anxiety could become a Data Analyst or should I try a different path? 😅 I have good communication skills but bad anxiety in social situations. It's something I really wanna overcome though! Your videos are great by the way. Really appreciate how thorough they are.
yRWkSKRYCaI,Great content as usual. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and perspective of what everyone aspiring to become a data analyst or trying to improve their skills should be aware to capitalize the technical skills.
yRWkSKRYCaI,"I commented about a month or two ago about landing an interview but ultimately didn't get it.

 I kept applying And I start  my new Analyst position  at the end of the month! I think I started this journey last July and it's paid off.  Thanks for your content."
yRWkSKRYCaI,Great
yRWkSKRYCaI,I really appreciate you and the content you provide.  I just started a data analyst cohort so I'm using your videos to help guide me.
yRWkSKRYCaI,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
yRWkSKRYCaI,Great upload. Is it recommended to have a degree as an analyst?
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hey Alex, thank you for the insightful information in this video! Also, do you still do mentoring on your patron? Or any open spots for it?"
yRWkSKRYCaI,Is graduation necessary? What if i am not a graduate but complete a data analytics course such as Google's certification program on Coursera. Will that be ok?
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hi Alex. Could you give technical tips on what specs a data analyst/scientist should go for when choosing their desktop/laptop?

Thank you for the videos. Very helpful guides/insight for those who are planning on shifting to this line of work."
yRWkSKRYCaI,Drilling down even further on file/folder organization would be super helpful - this is seldom even mentioned let alone modeled or taught.  Another outstanding video @Alex :)
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hi Alex just found out Data Analyst 
Please how do I get started???"
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Hello Alex, I just finished my data analysis internship and now they gave me a role to be a data analysis solution architect and this is due to my soft skills and technical, apparently I possess both equally so. Does this apply to me, I am clueless."
yRWkSKRYCaI,Alex i'm gooing to start my master degree fo data anlyst so waht kind of recomadation do you have for me
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Alex your contents are really very helpful, I would appreciate if you do an end to end practical project which we can follow and add up on our resume."
yRWkSKRYCaI,"Nice video as always Alex. 
Can you make a video on how to add our excel projects to our portfolio? Thanks."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thanks!!!!
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hi Alex, would it be a better option to use Power Query Editor to do Data Cleaning in Excel? As someone with few experience in Python or R (to actually use it for data cleaning), I'd love to learn about ways to clean data using other tools like Excel..."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Done
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thank you very much Alex for this insightful video.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Nice class. BTW you are handsome 😊
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hello Alex... Thank you for the information... Question... When working with data sets with description of products, inventory, etc that may include special characters like trademark, registered, or copyright. Intuition says to strip those symbols right off the bat, but how often are things like that requested to be kept and what are the best ways to keep them from fouling things up for applications like Python, SQL, etc? Duplicate columns seems like an option, but almost too easy and potentially problematic. 

If anyone deals with this regularly, I'd like your feedback."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,can anyone tell me what keyboard shortcut he used at 11:15
_jmiEGZ6PIY,He do I download the files you use to work
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"the data set was too small to be honest, didnt get to learn much. and you skipped one of the column which i think could have been cleaned in some ways."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thanks for this super introduction sir
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Two issues were missed:
1.There are two duplicates: Barack Obama and Woodrow Wilson in the president column
2. There is ""Demorcatic"" instead of ""Democratic"" in the party column"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,one of the best video in youtube for data cleaning.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,How you change republicans with republic had you copied ? I didn't get how it change as republic
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Alex Bhai tere ek bhe hair hai ki nhi 😂
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thank you sir
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Is there a discount code for the Excel course on Data Analyst?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,great and helpful
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Thank you alex, your informations are helpful. I am a nigerian and this is part of how i learnt and became a data Analyst and i am so grateful"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hi Alex, I'm trying to come up with unique ideas for my project portfolio, but I am going through your entire course.  I'm doing this to highlight my background and explain how I have used data analysis in previous positions as a teacher, library manager, professor of empirical research methods, and even a Realtor.  But the question I ran into was this I have a data set that has given me the names of people but because of privacy laws, I can't use the names in the data. The names are given in one cell as last, first (e.g.  Smith, John). I created two columns to fix the issue by using initials. I used this in the first formula:

=LEFT(D2,1)&LEN(D2)&RIGHT(D2,LEN(D2)-FIND("","",D2))

I was left with a result of ""S11 John""

In the second column, I used:

=LEFT(C2,1)&MID(C2,5,1)

to get ""SJ""

I then had to copy that column and paste it into a 3rd column to get the results independent of the formulas.  Did I just ""reinvent the wheel"" or was there an easier way to do this?

Also, I was lucky not to have repeat initials, but if I did how could I handle that?"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"✅complete
thank you, this was so much fun"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,I think power query is more efficient to clean data in Excel. right?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Thank you Alex! Please how can I. Clean an age range dataset of 21-30,40-45"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,it's blurd !!!!
_jmiEGZ6PIY,que version de excel es ? que año?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"I'm so excited i found this channel, have interest in data analysis but have no prior knowledge on that, hopefully will get a lot from here, thanks so much 😊"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,im frustating handling data customer with so many miss input and duplicate also connect with transaction data. because of that i cant delete the data to clean the data. what i did is just create another code to unify the customer data if the data is actually 1 same person with different written spelling on the dataset. this make me crazy to manually sort and decide what data is need to merge and what data is dont need to merge. any suggest for me if i process the data with excel only?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"hello, I just begin this from bootcamp series, I have a question when i download the file and after removing duplicates i still see I have 2 same 27Woodrow Wilson data, even I ride removing duplicates action it keeps 2 row, do someone faced this? Im curious about it because it's small data so i can randomly noticed it, what if i work with big data?"

_jmiEGZ6PIY,Please how did you correct the republicans so easy after the filtering?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Please how did you correct the republicans so easy after the filtering?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Thanks 👍 alot Alex , you are great!"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Alex you should do a walkthrough on cleaning the Airbnb Chicago 2019 data set from Kaggle and creating Pivot charts for such data set. That was a fun project, but it's truly mind bending at some points. Large data set."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"""I really want to acknowledge you right now because I'm just a beginner in data analytics and currently in my second year of graduation. This is my first time exploring the field of data analytics, and I appreciate how well you explained it. As a beginner, I found it complex and difficult to understand, but you made it much easier. I'm truly grateful for that. Thank you, sir!"""

_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thank you.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,I can't download the Dataset on ur GitHub I don't know why
_jmiEGZ6PIY,FYI: You missed a mistake in the party column: DemoRCATIC. Fixing that allows removal of the duplicate line of Woodrow Wilson. 🙂
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hey Alex, I love your videos, but when you remove the duplicated values, why Woodrow Wilson remains? given that it appears to have the same row, it is not identified as a duplicated row, why? if anyone can help i would appreciate it.
Anyways, your content is nuts. <3"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,I don't usually add comments but I have watched a lot of Excel tutorials and this was by far the best one I feel like I actually learned something and can immediately apply it!
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Do we have any cleanup data jobs?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Please help
I’m not able to download the file through the link you sent"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,How can someone be able to gwt you email?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,The best content on internet! Thanks for that! Do you know where I can Find more dirty data to practice and do more cleaning data projects? Thanks!
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Can someone tell me where he got the file in kaggle
_jmiEGZ6PIY,VERY USEFUL THANK YOU
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Hello!  I'm new to this and would just like to know why would someone need to clean data?  Was this your work or did someone send it to you to clean?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"tomorrow i have an interview for market research at japan company, one of the question is about cleaning data in excel. thankyou for making this video!! you helped me a lot! thank you so much! break a leg for me !"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Very nice presentation!!! 🎉
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thanks alex for being my bestie and also cleaning my confused mind into sorted . a big heart for you ❤️
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Could have explained in half the time.    🙏
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Bof
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Use power query to clean dara
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Sir Actually in first step that you remove duplicates. There are 2 duplicates, another is not retrieved automatically because Woodrow Wilson name appears twice. reason was second of that name has democratic as demorcatic . so, it looks like a unique value. Totally there are 2 duplicates."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,love you sir ji.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thank you Alex. This has been very useful
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Instead of cleaning data in PRIOR column you just deleted it?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,thx soo much
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Good video, but may i ask why you didnt use powerpivot for cleaning?"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,thanks Alex
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hi Alex, I tried the date formatting and it didn’t work on my data set."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Amazing video!
Thank you so much!"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"I noticed that with Excel, whenever you remove duplicates, both the original and duplicated records are removed. Is there a way of having only the duplicated record removed while maintaining the original record?"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Why is no one saying anything about how we can't download the datasets from his github for any of the videos in this series?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thank you so much Alex ❤
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Its a really helful tuitorial. I subcribed right away the minute it helped me with my problem. Thank you for your expert advice.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Great analytical skill⚡
_jmiEGZ6PIY,We can either clean like how alex cleans or we can use powerquery to clean right?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,How can i download the excel thoroughly in my laptop?
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Thank you Alex, you have really helped me in my data learning journey."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,you are absolutely a gem and best teacher out there
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Very thankful for your help with this Excel data cleaning.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"After downloading a dataset and importing into Excel, SQL, Power BI, etc. How can you tell that it needs cleaning if the first few rows appear correct. Also after cleaning the data, how do you know that you've completely cleaned it and the data quality is 100%"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,KUM BERTRAND KUM. This was really great. Amazing Videos. Becoming a Data Analyst
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Hi Alex, I even removed ' . ' in the name column using proper(substitute(text,""."","""")) formula. Tnx for these excel tutorials... i learnt a lot."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,thanks alex
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Alex, I love all your videos and content. However, this video was my favorite of your Excel Bootcamp videos. I know the dataset was small and simplified for us, but I felt like you did a wonderful job breaking down the data cleaning process. So, the skills we learned in this video can easily be applied/transferred over to much larger datasets. I so appreciate everything you do for us. As always, THANK YOU!!"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Thanks for this video Alex
Pls how can we clean a null values in date column and blank values in date column"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"in minute number 9 , how did u make the republicans with s looks like republican without s , what did u do on keyboard"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"hey the data set you clean was as simple was to teach playgroup kids ,,, please bring some complex data set cleaning
regards"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Simple yet effective things you can do to clean data in Excel, very helpful thank you"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thank you for your endless effort for making this amazing learning video.
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Waaaw, I really appreciate that good work. Thank you✌🏾"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,I learned Ctrl-Y to go forward from this video which was cool. Two things I would have done differently is 1) standardize dates to yyyy-mm-dd 2) Kept decimals in salaries so it doesn’t get read as integers
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Great job!
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"hey , I cannot download the sample files from the description link to Github in any of your videos in the series ...not sure why is this happening."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"Alex, I am so grateful to you. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. I learned new Excel functions and your delivery of this important information was exceptional. Thank you Alex. This was a very helpful presentation."
_jmiEGZ6PIY,I loved this! This helped a lot :)
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"at 9:02, what shortcut did you do?"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Thanks!
_jmiEGZ6PIY,Intro 2 min too long...
_jmiEGZ6PIY,"i thought i missed the democratic-domorcatic spelling issue in the video i have it in my data but not in the vid but regardless i spot it and cleaned it up, very easy to understand thanks for the amazing vid"
_jmiEGZ6PIY,thanks ...
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex, this video is great keep up the good work. I am preparing for the Data Analyst exam and you video helps. Currently i am solving as many practice questions as i can from gettableaucertifications (a friend of mine recommended me). I hope to pass the exam."
4A8LV6fObYA,Tableau sucks. Power BI rocks
4A8LV6fObYA,you really lost me while keep comparing between desktop and data analyst. talk about what the video title says
4A8LV6fObYA,"$1000 for training is a big ask.  I already have a Curator license and am practicing and working with the tool.  I cannot seem to locate the free clickable links that you showed.  I can see you poated the link to the exam guide, but the exam guide does not seem to contain the clickable links demonstrated in your video.  How do reach the free clickable links?"
4A8LV6fObYA,The question is will you get a job with this certification? Because everyone gets a job a different way most seem to have a degree or worked in a related field.
4A8LV6fObYA,Please make a video of all the cool stuff you've done with Tablealu
4A8LV6fObYA,"great share, do you have a video on how to prepare for the desktop cert"
4A8LV6fObYA,"yo dude just a minor tip: if making a ""review"" of a certification, maybe actually take it instead of just reading the online descriptions and ""judge the book by it's cover""💀"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Thanks for content. You guys are crazy in the USA to think 1000 dollars is a lot. Imagine how i must feel with my currency that is  so weak against the dollar. You have to think of future income. If the future You is going to earn 100k +, how can 1000 dollars make you sweat.Also ,to land your first Job. What if this certification got you a Job?  The return on your investment is paid back in 30 days., and what about future earning loss if you did not have it."
4A8LV6fObYA,"Good day. I have a question: does the course you recommend from Coursera cover SQL, Tableau Prep, Tableau Server and Tableau Online?"
4A8LV6fObYA,while giving the data analyst exam do we have an option to browse the answers
4A8LV6fObYA,Do you know when the bi-weekly instructor lead sessions take place? Are they recorded?
4A8LV6fObYA,can students take this exam for free??
4A8LV6fObYA,Hey Alex what course on coursera would you recommend for data analytics?
4A8LV6fObYA,"Good evening Alex, thank you so much for all of your videos. Regarding Tableau Data Analyst Exam Readiness, there is a 50% discount right now so given that - do you think it is worth it?"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex , a little help could you kindly suggest if we can clear this exam. I am completely new to tableau, have zero knowledge in tableau. My company is sponsoring so I don't want to waste it"
4A8LV6fObYA,For someone like me who have no experience on tableau where do you think it’s best to start learning
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hey Alex. Does the Coursera course work well with Tableau Public?  Without desktop, as I don’t have it, will it hinder me from learning the coursework?"
4A8LV6fObYA,"I bought the Creator E-learning license, which is cheaper than purchasing the Certification Prep Program. $10 a month vs $1000."
4A8LV6fObYA,ComptiA Data analysis?
4A8LV6fObYA,Is free content on tableau websites enough to prepare for the exam?
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hey Alex, i am in the process of deciding which one between these two to take: Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (cost 39$ a month) or the The Tableau Data Analytics Certificate (course cost around $3000, it incorporates business analytics implications)? I have a bachelor of science in economics and looking to do a career shift to business and data analytics. I know the first certificate includes the use of R programming language, so i am quite curious as to which one you recommend minding the cost, skills that will be acquired and career and employment prospective. Thank you so much in advance 🙏"
4A8LV6fObYA,They're trying to LOOT us. Maybe its a news for people in the US but education and specially exams should not cost that much.
4A8LV6fObYA,"I shelled out $750 (at a discount) for the exam prep course. The course offers a mockup exam which is extremely valuable. Using Associate Cert. preparation is NOT enough. For example, an exam question requires us to know the difference between Rank Dense vs. Unique, Initial SQL vs. Custom SQL ... the title sounds cool, but the exam is challenging if you haven't used Tableau Desktop/Prep/Server for a while (I would say years). Long term, I think the same is going to be a requirement. Short term, probably not ... I took the exam on March 4, 2022, and was still one of the first 1,000 (got this early bird thing) which tells me the demand is still low (or many fail?)."
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex, I wanted to ask that I don't have computer science background, Can I go for Data analyst??"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex, i will pass the data analyst exam in 4 april and I want to know if you have sources or courses to prepare for this certification ?
 Thanks Alex"
4A8LV6fObYA,Keep up the good work Alex!
4A8LV6fObYA,Thanks for all your great advice and information!
4A8LV6fObYA,Phewww. Thanks for the video @Alex. So many requirements and certifications out there that I'm asking when does it stop which in turn makes me feel like a mediocre. Thought I had mastered Excel to an extent until I had to do an assessment using Google Sheets and Google Data Studio.
4A8LV6fObYA,Thanks for the video!  Any comments on the CompTIA Data+ cert (vendor neutral) that is just coming up? Could you take a look at it?
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hey Alex how are you? I recently found your YouTube channel after taking an interest in data analytics. I’ve seen tons of your videos already and I am grateful for what you do and all the amazing content you put out. I’ve began taking the Google data analytics course and have been taking plenty of notes, and so far I  think it’s an amazing course for someone who’s a beginner like me, but that’s what scares me. I went to college for a technical certificate in automotive. For the last 4 years I’ve been working on cars and making a living in this industry. I’m currently 22 and I know I have plenty of time to switch careers and do something I’ll love. What scares me the most about jumping ship into data analytics is the fact that my resume may be pretty weak compared to someone coming out of college with a bachelors degree in statistics or data related. I plan on making a portfolio and creating an amazing LinkedIn page once I develop my skills more but looking ahead it scares me at the thought of not being able to find a job in this field and being stuck in my current career. Any words of advise and encouragement? 

I know the google certificate alone won’t get me a job and I plan on taking a few more courses and definitely watching a lot more of your videos as well, but any advise would mean a lot to me thank you!"
4A8LV6fObYA,I love how honest Alex is. This is why I follow him.
4A8LV6fObYA,Could you please recommend a good excel certification?
4A8LV6fObYA,"I took the Tableau Data Analyst Certification exam a few weeks ago, and I received the result 6 hours after the exam. Playing around with Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and Tableau Server is really important because many multiple-choice questions ask you to list the procedure for doing certain steps (i.e. creating subscriptions/alerts, exporting cleaned data from Tableau Prep)."
4A8LV6fObYA,"Which looks better on a resume, this or the Google data analytics certificate?"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Jalapeno! Oh wait.

A grand seems like a lot, especially if you have more time than money. 🤔 I'm sure there are people in both situations."
4A8LV6fObYA,Which one to get Tableau data analyst vs    CompTIA Data+?
4A8LV6fObYA,My company is paying for the exam readiness program and I'm looking to start it in July/August. I'll report back when I do. I appreciate the thoroughness Alex.
4A8LV6fObYA,Hello Alex. How do you get this Tableau software. Is it after you enroll for the course?
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hello Alex, now I’ve only just got done with the 3rd Course of the Google Data Analytics certificate. As u know only too well I shall eventually have to explore working with tableau, doesn’t the google certificate offer sufficient knowledge of tableau to get started as a junior data analyst ? Will I have to go deeper with the coursera specialization on visualization ? Lastly, ur opinion on the free tableau courses on YouTube as a substitute for the coursera specialization."
4A8LV6fObYA,"Why would one want a certification from Tableau? Do employers really care? As long as you practice and make projects and focus on getting better, isn't that enough?"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex,

So as per your inputs which certification can turn out to be useful for gaining knowledge also helpful in future?"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Ugh, Coursera is way better with free certs. Dunno why they cost a lot"
4A8LV6fObYA,"For me , 250 USD is absolutely too expensive for taking a tableau Data Analyst Exam. If you want to show your future employers that you know how to build tableau dashboards , i think taking Tableau Specialist to good enough to go."
4A8LV6fObYA,I'm putting this video in watch later.... I finished sql  right now and i want to do lts of projects .....i saw your video on projects....they're very helpful...☺
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex! At first please receive my thanks for all those amazing advices. Your videos like many have helped me too to find the confidence and work towards the data analyst goal.
I have a question to ask you. What is the significance of statistics to be a good data analyst? Should I learn statistics skill (aside the basic ones) before or after the data analyst certifications?"
4A8LV6fObYA,Hey Alex.. You seem to be an amazing guy.. love your videos.. Can u do a similar video for power bi too?
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hi Alex,
Thanks for making such informative video as always.

I'm a beginner and want to learn Tableau from scratch.

Do you suggest me to go with Tableau Desktop certification or Tableau Data Analytics certification ???

Thanks 👍"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Hello, I’m new to the channel and have a few questions. What would you recommend for someone whose is interested in getting into the field? I started a course on coursera but got sidetracked. I’ve even considered just going back to college, switching my major and doing it that way. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
4A8LV6fObYA,"great vids like always, will you be making in the future more project based tuts? this channel is a great resource keep going thank you Alex"
4A8LV6fObYA,Can a guy that learned tableu while google data analytics certification program pursue this certification?
4A8LV6fObYA,Is it free?
4A8LV6fObYA,"It's like Alex reads my mind. Whenever I have something on my mind, in a week or two Alex has a video up for it. Thank you for all the great work you have really changed my life for the better 🙏🏽"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Finally, a review of Tableau Data analyst is here"
4A8LV6fObYA,"Better learn power bi
Didn't get job after learning tableau 
I ll solely focus on powerbi"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Thanks Alex, a great video!"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Great info! I have a molecular biology and agricultural background. I use ""ag-tech data analyst"" but I can't filter the  job offers I am seeking. Any advice?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"I'm a Media Analyst ahaha~ Basically it's just a data analyst analyzing media and social media. My friends and family all think I read articles and write summaries or something ahaha, it's so hard to explain to them what data analyst does"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Adding a 6th alternate title- Learning Analyst, or Learning Analytics Specialist, which is the data analyst role in the field of education."
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Technical Data analyst, and business analyst. They all overlap with each other, and the skill lists might be the same, but the focus will for sure be different."
MPENhkuSo0Q,Thanks Alex! Liked and subscribed ))
MPENhkuSo0Q,Hey Alex it seems really hard to break through to get an analyst position. I am coming from healthcare. Even healthcare has analyst but hard to get a job  any tips ?
MPENhkuSo0Q,This dude has skills! #1 subs provider -> Promo-SM!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"I would like you to make a "" What to do & How to "" video for the Non US Citizen , Entry Level Data Analyst since its been a struggle for us to find a starting job in US."
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hi Alex: Not sure if you are already aware, Facebook now offers marketing analytic certificate on Coursera."
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hi Alex, I got a data analytics job and want to thank you because you helped me in my transition to data analyst and in the job hunt as well, your videos are a great help , thanks :)"
MPENhkuSo0Q,What are your suggestion on obtaining an Epic Analyst job the requires an Epic certification? Every job requires one but the only way to get one is to go through Epic directly or a hospital that will uses the software...
MPENhkuSo0Q,Great videos Alex! I am in the PMO team and I want to use tableau to show the leadership team the direct and indirect impacts we have on our stakeholders due to high number of projects in our portfolio (100+). I was wondering if there is any data set about projects that I can use to play around and try use cases.
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Informative video as usual! However, in my home country, engineering is so overlooked and underdeveloped that we only have a few data analyst and scientist roles haha"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Absolutely wrong information about Business Analyst role . A BA is a bridge between technical and business people. A BA writes the user stories along with product manager in agile environment. Data analyst prepares the data, process the data , analyze the data and present the data in dashboards to stakeholders that help in data driven decision making ."
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hey, really enjoy your videos, they're very insightful and easy to follow. Can you do a project on propensity modelling?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Awesome share!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"a data scientist told me data analyst are gonna be automized , is it true ?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"For a data analyst position, what should you know about Python and/or R before you put it on your resume`?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Thanks Alex!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"I work for a fortune 10 healthcare company (not the one Alex works for) and my team functions as analyst, but we all have the titles (SR.) Healthcare Economics Consultants.  We use Tableau, SAS and SQL Server as well as other internal tools.  The education requirements are usually non technical degrees, such as Economics, Statistics, Finance, Health Administration, Mathematics or related field."
MPENhkuSo0Q,Healthcare Analyst unite! Thumbs up if you in the #healthcareanalyst fam
MPENhkuSo0Q,@ Alex The Analyst..I have 3 yrs experience in provider data management will that be useful to transition into data analyst path..planning to do coursera courses you recommended..
MPENhkuSo0Q,Reporting Analyst ✅
MPENhkuSo0Q,Thanks you Alex!
MPENhkuSo0Q,thank you boss.
MPENhkuSo0Q,Rudolf the red nose Analyst
MPENhkuSo0Q,Immediately I saw this title I hit subscribe and notifications bell. This is a very useful stuffs. A lot of information here.
MPENhkuSo0Q,I am just finishing up my program with Coursera and starting my capstone project! I am also planning to build my portfolio by using your video guides! What are your thoughts on applying to some jobs while working on your portfolio? Is it smarter to just wait until you've built something solid or is it okay to go for it?
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Couldn't finish the video. Can't stop laughing at your nose. 
Thanks!!"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Very helpful to find a fitting niche to fit my skills and interests!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Just curious, how does Salesforce fit into the Data Analyst world?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,thanks for all your videos and advice but I think you denoise your audio too much some times.
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Exactly what I was struggling when I was serching for internships, great video ! I would include in terms of more managerial jobs perhaps the data project manager/data product manager/data owner/data chief officier, which are sometimes difficult to understand"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Great idea to remove the tunnel vision for job seekers and zoom out.
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Also wondering about years of experience. When you have a portfolio, but no direct work experience, should you apply for jobs that ask for 2 years data analysis experience? 3 years? What do you think is practical, Alex?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Another title that seems to align well with data analysis is a retention analyst. I currently am in a role as a retention specialist and found when learning data analyst skills there was a ton of overlap. I am now in round 3 and a finalist for a client retention analyst position thanks to the combined skillsets.
MPENhkuSo0Q,How does Research Analyst compare to Data Analyst? Would that be a good first step when trying to get into Data Analytics?
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Thank you for this, Alex. Been trying to find data analyst positions within cyber security but not much luck."
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Wow!
That's the joy of fatherhood!"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Here are a few more:
Business Intelligence Engineer
Analytics Engineer -- this is a new title and is getting a lot of traction."
MPENhkuSo0Q,Can someone straight out of high school with strong Mathematic skills and is well versed in both Python and Spreadsheet technology break into the Data Analysis industry? Or would they need some sort of degree or relevant qualification?
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hi, Alex. Big admire, I consider you as my mentor. I learned a lot from your video. I wanted to ask you what should be the perfect/Proper answer in  the field: Message to Hiring Manager, Let the company know about your interest in working there. How should we convince them?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Thank you Alex. Really hope you respond to this. For someone with a legal background, what suggestions would you give to such person when looking for jobs as a  Data Analyst"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Oh those job titles ...
MPENhkuSo0Q,Amazing content love your channel❤❤❤
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hi Alex! I must say that your guidance has been so helpful trough the process of changing my career path so thank you for that. I do have a small question for you or the community, ¿is there a way to filter out LinkedIn job offers that only accept candidates from a specific country for a remote position?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,I am towards the end of the Google Data Analytics certificate and I find the visualizations most interesting.I think about taking a Tableau course next on Coursera.
MPENhkuSo0Q,Could a masters in business analytics help?
MPENhkuSo0Q,How necessary is it to have a Masters degree when going into this field or trying to move up within it? I see that it’s either a required or desired qualification for a lot of jobs I’ve looked at.
MPENhkuSo0Q,I'm essentially a Data Analyst with a title of Business Analyst.
MPENhkuSo0Q,"I graduated with a degree in Economics and I’m looking to jump into being an analyst, would it make more sense to look into being a Data analyst or Business/Marketing Analyst. What exactly is the difference"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Hey Alex how are you? Thanks for all the hard work. Can you make a video on salary negotiation? Thank you!
MPENhkuSo0Q,Helpful
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hey, Alex, what are your thoughts on GitHub Copilot and AlphaCode? I’ve been reading about their potential to automate our jobs within just a few years."
MPENhkuSo0Q,Alex the red nose analyst!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"Hey Alex, great video but, I'm starting my first job ever next week as a ""Business Intelligence Consultant"" and sadly you didn't cover it 😔 How do you think my role compares to Data Analyst?"
MPENhkuSo0Q,Now I know how to streamline my data analyst job search!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"As a pharmacist seeking to become a data analyst, I find this video useful. Thanks Alex!"

MPENhkuSo0Q,Thank you Alex! Your videos have been so helpful.
MPENhkuSo0Q,Thank you alex.
MPENhkuSo0Q,Very helpful Alex! Thank you!
MPENhkuSo0Q,"I was literally just researching the difference between Data Analysts/Business Analyst/Business Intelligence Analyst, and then this video pops up. This content is so useful. Thank you."
3irO29PJQHs,Thanks but what about PowerBI? Any courses for powerbi?
3irO29PJQHs,I'm about to really start my journey so glad I found you!
3irO29PJQHs,"This is cool and very helpful.   I'd like to see an update for 2024.  For instance, could you replace IBM Data Analytics with the Google Advanced Data Analytics and the Business Intelligence course?  I've just started my journey into analytics with the Digital marketing course and now the Google Analytics course.  Followed by the advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence when I get to it."
3irO29PJQHs,"I wish the IBM one was included in Coursera Plus, but none of the IBM courses are, unfortunately. I had most of these bookmarked already but added the last one for Tableau. I decided getting the Plus was the better option since I completed the Google Data Analytics in just over 4 weeks. I figure it'd be a waste of money to end up paying for a second entire month if I finish in 5 -6 weeks. 

There is a Tableau Business Intelligence Analyst one too that looks like it will be fun to learn."

3irO29PJQHs,"Thanks for the video Alex!   I want to learn Python really bad, but I'm very new to data analytics.  So I most likely will go with Coursera. Still deciding.
Excellent video Alex.   I just have to make up my mind."
3irO29PJQHs,"Coursera sucks!  Learned more about SQL/PYTHON in 3 weeks at Udemy than 4 to 5 months with Cousera.  

Plus:  You actually own the course and review it unlimited times vs paying a monthly fee.  Less than $250 you can learn all the skills you need get started as a data analyst or programmer.  

You can always list those certifications from Coursera on your resume as employers will not check.   Wasted my money/time with Coursera."
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex.. Thanks very much for this video. I'm about to begin my journey as a data analyst. Do you have any idea how i can apply for financial aid on the Google certification alongside the other courses you recommended?
I'd really appreciate s response from you.
Thank you so much"
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alexl, thanks for sharing this great video. I would like to ask you, I'm Mac user how can install or use  BI for visualization, what tool do you recommend to improve my information? thanks"
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you so much for this info
3irO29PJQHs,"New to both you and Coursera -career change. IDK if anyone else has this question but I don’t see a cost beyond the monthly membership. Is there an additional cost to complete the courses and gain my certificate? 
Love your videos and channel"
3irO29PJQHs,Great video
3irO29PJQHs,Can I get a remote job as a data analyst?
3irO29PJQHs,"So we can put all of the projects in our portfolio/resume.  I was wondering that,  thank you."
3irO29PJQHs,"You care, man. You really do and that's amazing.
YT is great for many things and many creators are sharing valuable stuff. But rarely you find someone who takes so much time to create valuable content broken down in the most understandable manner and who does it in such a consistent way. Thank you Alex!"
3irO29PJQHs,pls tell me it is free or what ?
3irO29PJQHs,I am taking the analytics course from Google. So should I also take any of these along with it for better results?
3irO29PJQHs,"I recently finished the Google data analysis course. I decided to learn SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, and PowerBI from YouTube, but are taking these courses necessary? I want whatever will land me my first entry-level"
3irO29PJQHs,"Thank you for the video, this made me realize that I really should take the IBM DA course instead of Google's to learn some Python skills as I eventually want to go into Data Science."
3irO29PJQHs,Very informative.  What technical resources would you recommend to take these courses?   Thx.
3irO29PJQHs,"Thank you, Professor Alex, for this wonderful video. All the courses you mentioned are excellent, except for a SQL course. The method of presenting the course is very bad, and there are great gape between the first part of the course and the second part. For me, this course is unusable"
3irO29PJQHs,what the best for Machine Learning IBM Data Analyst or Google data analysis?
3irO29PJQHs,"You're the man!!! I really cannot say thank you enough. I'm beyond grateful for your energy, inspiration, and you're making the world a better place."
3irO29PJQHs,"If I'm already taaking the Google Analytics course, would you still recommend getting the IBM one?"
3irO29PJQHs,"I do not get tired of watching this video, I watched it countless times."
3irO29PJQHs,Please ..... Stop ... The Smile !..
3irO29PJQHs,Great video Alex. This is video is helping me choose the right courses to take to start my career as a data analyst!
3irO29PJQHs,Super efficient video. Thank you. Helps a lot
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you
3irO29PJQHs,Hi Alex! Thanks for this great video! Could you let me know the best order to follow these courses? Python first and then IBM?
3irO29PJQHs,What the price ?
3irO29PJQHs,Is it worth for it to do a MSc in Data science from Uk
3irO29PJQHs,Sir why dont you open a course by yourself and teach us all about industrial data analysis.
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex! I have been following your channel, and have made some moves out of a management role in Admin where I dabbled in some reporting and started to explore a career shift. I am following along with your videos to see what exactly the path I should take is, but with very little experience, im wondering if there are some things you would suggest I do before taking the journey through the courses in this video.

Knowing the Google cert is for beginners, I am just thinking there may be some intermediate or advanced excel, or maybe some intro to SQL/Python or Tableau... or maybe that really is not necessary?

Do you have any advice?"
3irO29PJQHs,Udemy in 2022
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you for the videos. I am a visual learner and I am changing careers. These videos have really helped me get a better understanding of some things that will help me in this process.
3irO29PJQHs,"Thank you, Alex! I noticed there is also IBM data science certificate on  Coursera, which is similar with the data analyst certificate. Which is better in your opinion? Thank you!"
3irO29PJQHs,A year ago you weren’t that much fan of coursera Alex 🧐
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, is the IBM certification still worth it if I mainly use Power BI? I am abit hesistant with the Google cert sicne it focuses to much on R and Tableau ( I use python and Power BI in my work)."
3irO29PJQHs,"Thank you Alex, this video was great :)"
3irO29PJQHs,Can anyone tell me that if I want to become a data analyst what courses of python for everybody should I take  because some are for websites
3irO29PJQHs,"Omg, so glad I found your videos.  They are EXACTLY what I needed for questions I've been having.  Praying you see my last comment on working completely remotely and I can get your feedback on that or maybe a direction on where to go (who to ask?) to make sure I can get a job as a Data Analyst that is completely remote and will allow me to work outside the US before I continue to pursue it too much more.  I'm flying through the Google course now - so interesting and just wanting to learn more and more!  Thanks for all the great info!"
3irO29PJQHs,"Hello Alex, this is exactly advice I have been looking for. Most courses from Australian Univeristy and technical colleges do not cater for beginners. Best Sarah"
3irO29PJQHs,"what option for power Bi ?, it seems to be in high demand ."
3irO29PJQHs,I can't get free enrollment in Coursera..
3irO29PJQHs,"Hello Alex! I’m new to your Channel and I am looking to dive into the excel/data analyst work space. Looking to get to a level where I can carry out freelance work as a data analyst. Would I need to complete all of these courses to get to that point or just a select few? If so, which ones would you recommend I focus my time on? Thank you!"
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, thanks for sharing this. Just wondering if there is an order which one should follow when learning. After the foundation course (Data Analytics by Google), what should I focus on Excel or SQL or Tableau?"
3irO29PJQHs,"1:45😁
Had a sneaky peaky of your top 5️⃣. Tabs were open.🤫
Jk🤭.

#google #dataanalyst #GoogleDataAnalyst"
3irO29PJQHs,"So I finished the first course on Google Data Analytics Specialization, and unlike everyone else, I don't feel hopeful about it. Hopefully, that changes once I'm done with a few more. As a side note, I followed your SQL basics playlist, and for the first time, it made sense. I tried learning SQL on DataCamp before but did not get it. But with your videos, I did. I'm so tempted to ignore Coursera and just stick with you."
3irO29PJQHs,Hello thanks for these recommendations . Are these courses free?
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, thank you for your advice and opinions. They have really helped me make informed decision in my pursuit of a data analytics career. Your videos have been very insightful and useful for this journey I'm on and I'm grateful to you. Just started the Google data analytics cert. Thank you!"
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you.
3irO29PJQHs,is the Google course suitable for someone living in the U.K. ?
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, thanks for everything that you are doing for people. Well I need a recommendation for SQL courses and best option for using SQL account for free that would be helpful for making my portfolio project. Just to let you know I just finished Google Data Analytics Courses."
3irO29PJQHs,"I've been taking the Google Data Analytics ... I should complete Course 7 soon (learning R is only second to learning basic  SQL).  That said, I appreciate this video because you provided a course that may expand my understanding of SQL. Additionally, learning Python is a must and the one you've highlighted is also one of a few I'd tagged as saved - choice made - Thx. A course neither taught/explained well was Tableau via Google Data Analytics, it was truly disappointing. May give it another go,  per your suggestion.
Thanks Again"
3irO29PJQHs,"This is really great Alex! I like the specificity. I'm glad this is not an ""it depends"" type of video. I'd be starting with the first one just like you recommended. Thank you!"
3irO29PJQHs,"Hey Alex! 
I had been looking through coursera and was a bit lost so I really appreciate this video. Thanks!
How are you and how is Max?
Do you think these courses teach enough for someone to land their first job?"
3irO29PJQHs,"Thanks a lot. I decided to go with the Google Data Analytics
I'm currently on week two of the Google Data Analytics course
Your donation towards my certification is highly appreciated here>>https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DZ7W3VEXS3L98"
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, I'm thinking Data or Business Analysis may be over my head and too time consuming for my personal life situation.  Any suggestions for more entry-level  IT job titles?  And thanks for the real deal informative videos!"
3irO29PJQHs,Thanks Alex! It’s exactly what I’m looking for! Really appreciate your advice on coursera courses!
3irO29PJQHs,"I am thinking of taking this opportunity to start from scratch the Data Analyst course.
I am really new to this subject.. any other recommendations before I dive into."
3irO29PJQHs,"I'm 36 ,in the oilfield & have no knowledge in data analysis or much of anything else for that matter. Looking for a change. Any hope for me ?"
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you Alex for the recommendations. Just fresh out of college with a BS in mathematics. Hoping to ramp up my resume by taking these courses and finding a career in data analysts.
3irO29PJQHs,"How do you learn tech skills through Coursera? Do we install our own software, or are there browser-based exercises?"
3irO29PJQHs,Is there any fees need to pay for google certification course and to get certificate?
3irO29PJQHs,"Thank you very much sir Alex, I did learn a lot from your videos and you did boost my energy for data science career shift."
3irO29PJQHs,"I am starting the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate today

Thank you very much Alex! You have really inspired me 💕😊"
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you Alex✌️
3irO29PJQHs,"Hey Alex, What do you think about Meta Marketing Analytics Certificate program on Coursera?
Also, if you're on LinkedIn please share your profile."
3irO29PJQHs,Thanks for the tip 🙂
3irO29PJQHs,hello alex do you think a course on statistics would be good to add to this list?
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, do you think taking Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate alongside Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp in Udemy would work as good as (or better than) taking IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate alone? 
As of now, I want to learn Python as my current company uses it sometimes (I work with data quite often, and now want to transition to Data Analyst).
And I already have the basics with SQL and Tableau, but of course, I would like to learn these skills further as well as get a certificate.
Also the first option would help saving a lot of costs."
3irO29PJQHs,"thanks a lot Alex I really love to watch your videos and learn from them, I have a question please what do you think about Udacity certificate in data analyst? I mean which one should I start with it. all my love."
3irO29PJQHs,Do you think getting these certifications can get you a job in analytics?
3irO29PJQHs,What do you think of the Certified Analytics Professional (CAP)
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, are the courses accessible for life ?
Thanks for your awesome videos."
3irO29PJQHs,"instead of tableau, they should include Google looker or google data studio, in Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate."
3irO29PJQHs,Can you actually get a job as a data analyst just by doing the ibm cert?
3irO29PJQHs,"Hey Alex what do you think about the Boston University applied data analytics master's program
It's a year long course
So tution fee is less
Also it's not that long 


Also what about co op program from northeastern uni 
It's a 2 yr program
Higher fees but co op


I honestly dont want to study for 2 yrs


Also my bachelor's is in mechanical engineering 


Should I go for anyone of these
Or stick to my current field"
3irO29PJQHs,I'm overwhelmed... Do I need to take all of these  courses before being considered for a Jr Data Analyst job or internship?
3irO29PJQHs,"Does anyone here make really good money as a data analyst? I’m trying to figure out if I should pursue this career, thank you!"
3irO29PJQHs,I'm taking the Google certificates course and documenting the entire journey on my tik tok! Some of my followers sent me to your page 😊
3irO29PJQHs,"DO NOT TAKE THE SQL SPECIALIZATION AT 4:35!

The first course is ok; its actually a great bigger course.

However, the second course uses a dataset that has been updated and does NOT match the instructor's dataset! All the correct answers you get will not match the instructors so how can you learn or test different methods? I went to the discussion forum and people have been complaining about this for TWO YEARS and they STILL have not corrected the issue.

I have not completed the that course or continued the specialization."
3irO29PJQHs,"Great vid this. is the exact vid i was look for 
THANK YOU SO MUCH"
3irO29PJQHs,"When you mentioned R programming for the Google cert, I couldn't help but remember your video when you compared it to Python. You had mentioned that the advantage Python has over R is that its better for machine learning........................LMFAO.............. I am not sure that you have ever used R, my friend."
3irO29PJQHs,Which courses would you recommend  for humanitarian and health care data analyst opportunities? What about AHIMA?
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, hope all is well! Love to hear your suggestions for data modeling/DB design courses if you have any. Thanks you."
3irO29PJQHs,Thanks for sharing Alex! You are a motivation 🤙
3irO29PJQHs,"I just found your video today and subscribed, I am starting Google analytics"
3irO29PJQHs,Khan Academy Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data? thoughts on this course vs Google data analytics certificate?
3irO29PJQHs,Thanks Alex for providing such a important information 🙏. Just one thing what order should we follow from all the five courses? Really appreciate your work ❤️
3irO29PJQHs,"Thanks Alex, I’ve been looking through various courses to learn data analytics for current job as biologist with the goal to get away from it. I no longer like where I work. Google has been on my RADAR so I’lol lock that in. Then the SQL, Python, Tableau."
3irO29PJQHs,I am halfway through Google Certificate and i am planning to do also the IBM and all others from this video. thanks for all video you post.
3irO29PJQHs,"Hey Alex, huge fan of your videos!

Just wanted to let you know that there's something weird going on with your audio. Not sure if you're aware of it, but it's definitely noticeable to us listeners."
3irO29PJQHs,"Hi Alex, could you suggest some courses that specializes in domain? thanks"
3irO29PJQHs,Thank you so much! this is very helpful :)
3irO29PJQHs,"Hello Sir,
I have done bachelor of commerce and
Actually I have no prior knowledge and experience in programming or in data world. But I am interested in data analysis from Coursera I want to explore it.  So should I go for it?"
3irO29PJQHs,This video has helped me a lot in figuring out how to break into a different career field than my current one. I plan on taking all of these courses and I was wondering in what order would you suggest taking them?
3irO29PJQHs,How long has it taken you to do the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate?
3irO29PJQHs,Hey Alex. Awesome video! Can you make a video on how to use data analytics for Crypto markets?
uHJFJUIYNAo,Is  this salary before taxes or after taxes ?
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Vacation time, paid leaves, etc."
uHJFJUIYNAo,Great video. Thanks Alex
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hey Alex, what about for remote data analyst jobs? I'm in Uganda and wondering the possibility of doing a remote data analyst job?"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Thank you, Alex! Want to also say thank you because I was doing an interview this week that wasn't supposed to be a technical interview, and I got thrown a question about when to use a view in SQL. You'd mentioned in one of your videos that that was a question you got in an interview, so I'd studied that and was able to answer it well! Yet another person helped by your content. 🙂"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hi Alex, great topic you have picked up for this video . Coming on to the same topic what duties and role is expected from Mid-Level Data Analyst and also when a company says  ""Comfortable with using any data system too"" and ""Needs to be able to troubleshoot and work independently"" ? Is it a red flag for a too much work ?"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Man, that salary does not seem great all for all the skills required. You can make that in like two years in marketing without knowing any sql  or python et."
uHJFJUIYNAo,The transparency from this channel is unmatched. Thank you sir
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hey Alex my name is Kelton Ratliff , I had some extra questions for you , so I’ve sent an email to you"
uHJFJUIYNAo,Do you think it is possible someone outside the US to get a Remote job with a company in the US?
uHJFJUIYNAo,Thank you for sharing Alex!
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hey Alex! Quick question. Do you think a portfolio (sql, tableau, python) can be too large? 

I did the projects you covered on your portfolio videos (with a few twists) and wanted to do some more on my own, but im worried it could get overloaded/overwhelming."
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hi Alex, great video! Could you do a video on the different data analyst career paths(i.e. Business intelligence analyst, data architect, data engineer etc)?"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Alex,you are the best"
uHJFJUIYNAo,🤔 Alex how'd you know I had this question
uHJFJUIYNAo,Hy Alex. Kindly guide me as i am filling my financial aid form it bounce back and not procedding even not getting any message that way. Please guide me.
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Thank you for your usefull channel. And i have a question wish you can expkain it in your videos, my question is how can i work as a freelance data analysis? And is this is applicable?"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Very useful, I happen to be interviewing right now so this is just on time"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hey Alex. I reaally Love your content and I've learned a lot with you, you are so valuable. I wanted to ask if it were possible to find a remote job for someone who lives in West Africa with a US company as an entry level analyst ?"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"OMG I’m so happy you did a video post on this,  will be 1 year in as a data analyst at a HealthCare Tech Startup and up for a new contract negotiation discussion by March and I’ve been puzzled on how to go about it because I don’t wanna be on loosing end, this means a lot Alex thanks so much, I’m still open to more advice ( came in as an intern) now moving to FTE"
uHJFJUIYNAo,Alex is Awesome😁
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Thanks to your videos, i landed a job as data analyst last week. Keep up the good work 💜"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Thank you Alex, those tips are really helpful."
uHJFJUIYNAo,"I love the numbers, thank you!"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Do you recommend negotiating with no actual experience asides from being self taught analyst for your first offer? 

Or respond with with what is your budget for this position? When salary subject comes up.
Thanks"
uHJFJUIYNAo,Vacation days too!
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Why you didnot think to build an outsourcing agency from worldwide dataanalyst?
If you did ,i can a good support to you"
uHJFJUIYNAo,I am a student and now looking for summer internship in data analyst or data science. I tried to work with recruiter but it seemed that she ignored me. I think she may not get commission from the companies for internship recruitment. Do you have any suggestion or tip to apply for internship?
uHJFJUIYNAo,Thanks Alex.
uHJFJUIYNAo,Hey Alex! Just finished my certification and had my first rejection letter ( after first round) . I'm still smiling though...to get the first interview at all is a step in the right direction.
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hey man, I hope you are doing well. Is it possible I can personally message I have to ask just few questions. Waiting for your reply.. Stay safe 🤍"
uHJFJUIYNAo,I have to say thank you. Your videos helped me through 3 rounds of interviews with a large fintech company. I am happy to say that this  video is so timely as I review the offer that I received from them last week.
uHJFJUIYNAo,Learning a lot from your videos. Thanks Alex. 🤩
uHJFJUIYNAo,"I was heartbroken when I saw the video about you no longer being a data analyst. That to me, that meant you saying; Hi guys, I've led you to the middle of the data analyst ocean, but now I've got to leave... Here, take my former videos as a compass to navigate, best of luck. I haven’t watched this video yet, but I feel excited to see that you care for the lost souls."
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hi Alex, learnt a lot from your videos. Keep going... I just wanted you to create a brief on domain knowledge"
uHJFJUIYNAo,"Hi, Alex I'm BA and I want to switch into data analyst after two years of gap. Please provide me the procedures to follow. Love your videos."

gMAHXrty6wI,Thank you God❤
gMAHXrty6wI,"Referencing 4:24, I am having difficulty removing ""Year End Total"" from the horizontal axis. I don't have the three icon pop ups on the side of the chart. The only solution that worked for me was changing each individual ""legend entries"" y value range AND change the horizontal axis label range. Still open to a more simple solution for a Mac user and Excel 16 if anyone has one"
gMAHXrty6wI,"✅complete
this is fun!"
gMAHXrty6wI,Hi Alex. When I click on the Udemy Excel course link that you have attached. I am not directed to an Excel course instead I am just on the Udemy website. Could you pls update the link?
gMAHXrty6wI,Thank you sir
gMAHXrty6wI,❤❤❤
gMAHXrty6wI,"Thank you very much, sir Alex
Good through these videos even though it's two years ago seems soo recent and relatable"
gMAHXrty6wI,Why am I unable to see the filter and chart element options near the chart below? :/
gMAHXrty6wI,Sir what excel year is this. Because mine has no maps the other one asked I connect to internet
gMAHXrty6wI,thnk you
gMAHXrty6wI,"25/74
Lets go!!!"
gMAHXrty6wI,Thank You Alex for always coming through ❤
gMAHXrty6wI,THANK YOU.
gMAHXrty6wI,You literally helped me out Alex. I was lost and didn’t know what to do when I worked. I was just getting bored and stopped studying but now it’s fun with you. Thank you and thanks for the efforts.
gMAHXrty6wI,Hello! Im using MS 365 in my MacBook but I cant find the filter part on the right side of the chart.
gMAHXrty6wI,Hi ! Thank you so much. Though know excel its always a been difficult for me to recollect the formulas when suddenly an excel task is assigned at work! I get really frustrated with myself when I work on excel. My perception of excel itself has changed because of your series. I feel more confident now. Heartfelt thanks to you for your efforts! keep doing more :)
gMAHXrty6wI,There were no data sets for this lecture
gMAHXrty6wI,Keep up the good work Alex. 🤝
gMAHXrty6wI,Just love to continue on your channel
gMAHXrty6wI,"Hi Alex, I’ve been trying to go through the excel tutorials but I don’t know which one to watch before which one…"
gMAHXrty6wI,"Job lag jaye bhai log
 sabki job lag jaye
  har har mahadev  
data analyst"
gMAHXrty6wI,Thanks Alex bhai🎉❤
gMAHXrty6wI,thank you so so much
gMAHXrty6wI,The 3D visualization gave me a headache just looking at it 😭
gMAHXrty6wI,I found it perfect for a beginner such as myself. Keep up the good the thorough work.  THANK YOU.
gMAHXrty6wI,"Alex, as a more of a unique way excel chart user, I am very offended by your comments"
gMAHXrty6wI,"Thankyou Alex.
You have truly help me  in data analytics journey, am always learning whenever I watch your videos"
gMAHXrty6wI,"Thanks, Alex!, It its incredible the amount of effort you put into this video series.  You're very much appreciated 👏"
gMAHXrty6wI,THANK YOU Alex!! This was a great summary of basic uses for charts in Excel. Enjoyed your sense of humor in this video! Making my way through your Free Bootcamp series. It's fantastic! Can't wait to start-up Analyst Builder!
gMAHXrty6wI,"When I click chart, I don’t get the 3 options to the right. The plus sign , the other and the one he’s using to filter the graph."
gMAHXrty6wI,Hey Alex. I'm just using these tutorials and I'm having a hard time finding some tools you used. Could it be so because I'm using Excel on Web?
gMAHXrty6wI,"I HAVE BEEN HAVING A NICE TIME WITH ALL THE TUTORIALS SERIES SO FAR, THANKS A MILLION."
gMAHXrty6wI,"Great ,Thank you Alex"
gMAHXrty6wI,On my journey through the boot camp...
gMAHXrty6wI,"Hey, Alex
For people who are following along with your course, will it be feasible to share the data used in your Videos?
(Maybe on your github?)"
gMAHXrty6wI,Wow! Thanks for this Alex .👏
gMAHXrty6wI,now I just need a decent resource for re-learning statistics
gMAHXrty6wI,Thanks for the video. It will be great to explain Combo charts. They are really useful.
gMAHXrty6wI,"Thanks Alex. 🙏
Learnt different aspects of customising a chart that i didn't know before."
gMAHXrty6wI,"Thank you for this video very helpful really! Some feedback though, I wish this was easier to follow along with my IOS device. One thing I'm missing out on is how amazingly simple Microsoft products make it to manipulate something like the Filter option you have on the side of the chart. My mac does not have that option sadly so I keep having to teach myself where things are located. Also, I cannot see descriptions once hovering over something with my mouse. Any ideas on how this might be a better experience for learning the material? Any settings I can alter to make things smoother for me? Thanks!"
gMAHXrty6wI,Ok another Alex video I have done.  This was an easy peasy one. I am familiar with charts. But it was good to know that in Data Analysis mostly line and bar charts are the norms to put together frequently.
gMAHXrty6wI,Is it seems to me or in older versions of Excel (for example 2010) there is no this kind of column chart with colors he has?
gMAHXrty6wI,thats alex
gMAHXrty6wI,Thanks sir for this amazing videos

BIUFr9srS78,PEPPER 🌶️!!! I’ve started learning data analysis around 1 month and half ago after seen you one of your videos. I spend long hours playing them on my way to work everyday. Your contents are so useful and fun. I totally support your dedication 👌

BIUFr9srS78,"Amazing content Alex! I never thought of data analytics until I started my own YT channel. When I was younger I knew I always wanted to have a career “helping people”. I always looked at healthcare so that’s exactly what I did, I went into nursing and became a nurse. I have always been a curious person searching for the why behind everything. I love being a nurse but I feel that it is time for a change. 

When I created my travel channel I just really enjoyed creating content, editing, creating scripts, monitoring the performance, etc. I started to research how to get into tech and started learning SQL not realizing I used similar skills before.

After days of research I’ve become even more interested in creating projects based on data. Recently started the google data analyst cert and I’m loving it so far. 

There is so much to learn and I’m still not sure how to even begin with tailoring my resume for a career change. I will continue to watch your channel because you seem very transparent and the info is very helpful. 

Thank you so much! I’m looking to learn so much more from you! 😊"
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper. Thank you for this video. I was searching for the difference between data analyst and analytics manager because I can't choose between the two courses. BTW, I've got a schorlarship program for analytics and planning to try this career. I think I'm going to start with data analyst course and see where it goes. Thanks again!"
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper... I've been binging all of your videos (going most recent to least recent). I love what you are doing for other Analysts and the community of Analysts at large. Keep up the good work!
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper! Thanks Alex really enjoyed  the video. In which part of your professional journey were you working remotely ? How did working remotely affected your professional development if it did a all? Would you recommend focusing on remote only opportunities even early on one's career as an Analyst? 💻🙂
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper 🌶  So ready to get started learning,  I have a medical career but don't want to lift patients as I get older and have always been interested in Computer work. Thank you for your channel!"

BIUFr9srS78,Pepper🫑🫑 I love watching your videos they help me stay motivated and I’m so happy to have found data analytics I love learning constantly and I feel like I’ll never run out of new things to learn
BIUFr9srS78,"Hey Alex,
I was on the same path as you with the healthcare route, specifically healthcare data. I realized that I had an interest and fascination in data and how it is used. I also have a decent amount of knowledge in computer systems. I am only 18 however I am barely starting this path of becoming a data analyst. I am glad we are in the technology era where I can watch your videos and gain more knowledge for free! If there are any courses or ways to connect with you as a mentor or guide, please comment. You are a big help, thank you!"

BIUFr9srS78,"Hi Alex, I started watching your video in 2020 where my life got turn was B2B manager, lost my job due to Covid then started looking for other skills came to your video learn skills from Coursera as you recommended, didn’t have enough money to get full course in coursera. So learn most of the things from YouTube and complete exam in trail periods in coursera. 2021 got job as data analyst, end of year got position as Bi analysts and recently got promoted to Data analytics manager. Your guidance helped me."
BIUFr9srS78,"This is really inspiring. I have been trying to learn on my own, I wish I had a mentor like you! I’m currently a financial analyst, always been in the finance/accounting realm, but always end up as the go to for compiling data and automating processes. No where near advanced yet, but pushing to transition out of finance soon. Loving your content and your story. Thanks for all of the information, us newbies appreciate it!"

BIUFr9srS78,Pepper!!!
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper :)  Tip regarding bootcamps with ""guarantees"" - recommend applicants screen the fineprint to ensure the bootcamp does not move the goalposts / calendar dates depending on economic conditions or other factors.  My bootcamp was helpful in pairing me up with a human mentor to explain things which was the #1 factor for me."
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper! Nice to hear your story. I subscribed!

BIUFr9srS78,"Hi Alex, I am in the process of changing careers from Managing in the retail field to an IT career. I have been watching your videos and it is giving a lot of inspiration. I thought I wanted to go into software development but in the past couple of months I have been looking at what other careers are in the IT field and came across Data Analyst. In my position currently I deal with looking at a lot of data, processing that data and coming with different ways to utilize it. I really enjoy looking and utilizing data and has given me the prospect of becoming a Data Analyst. I am struggling with breaking into the field and getting the right certs, but your videos are guiding me. Thank you for making these videos and please keep producing them."
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper
BIUFr9srS78,"Hi Alex, you really are an inspiration. My cliff notes story is I had a kid young and never finished my bachelors but over time was able to at least finish my associates ( all though it is a complete mess of courses with no focus) I got a job about 10 years ago that was in a B2B call center. Small company. A couple years in I was helping with a project and the owner liked my excel skills and I was able to move into a position that cleaned, prepped and loaded data for projects. Over time I learned little things here and there with sql, some Marcos in excel to help automate some reports I did. I had a report that took hours I got down to about 15 minutes . 🙃 
So I have just been there since but I am trying to grow my skills because I feel like I just know small pieces of a bunch of different things. I have just felt stuck for the last few years.
Your story inspires me to push and just dedicate the time to learn and do projects and make a portfolio. Because in the end, no one can take away your knowledge. And knowledge is power and opportunity. 
Great video!"
BIUFr9srS78,Hey Alex! I came across your channel recently and I have been trying to get into being a Data Analyst from being a mental health specialist. I have my bachelors in psychology and i have been enjoying doing research more than counseling.
BIUFr9srS78,"Still binging, still saying THANK YOU 🙏🏾 and still feel a pull in my heart whenever you mention your family, esp. your kids (as a mother of 3 re-routing her career, it provides a sense of validation/assurance that I am indeed doing this for myself AND my family 🙏🏾❤️)."
BIUFr9srS78,Hey Alex! I’m pretty new to the channel but so far great content! I started learning SQL just this week and I’m almost through the Khanacademy course! Also working with Break Into Tech course. I hope to switch careers out of my factory job this year!! Does an associates degree help with job searching?
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper! Thanks Alex!
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper!! You inspire so many people, including myself, thank you Alex! Oh, and I truly love you too 😉 hahaha seriously man keep up being yourself, we all love it 😊"
BIUFr9srS78,Hi Pepper!!  Thanks for uploading such great content! Greetings from Peru!!
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper!! I wanna be Alex when I grow up. I really appreciate the detailed share of your journey. I remember the old video you'd done about how you became an analyst, but this deeper dive was much better. You're a legend!"
BIUFr9srS78,"(Pepper) Your story is so inspiring to me! I recently graduated with my bachelor’s in applied math and I do have some experience with SQL, python, and R. However, I think my self doubt has prevented me from applying to data analyst positions because I think I am not “good enough” or don’t know enough. I’m convinced I need to be an expert before applying (which doesn’t seem like the case based on your story). I have an unrelated job at the moment, and I’m trying to work on my skills on the side. I’m hoping in 2022, I will gain confidence and end the year in a data analyst role."
BIUFr9srS78,You are accusing bootcamps of getting money from people but you only think about money. Also your tutorials are just so basic that doesnt give any information for the people who are searching jobs.
BIUFr9srS78,"Big Bell Peppers, thank you so much for the information"
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper! ;)

Hi Alex! I’ve just found your channel and I couldn’t be happier!  I went to school and got my Masters in Statistics but, then got married and moved all around for my husbands job and just didn’t have the opportunity to start my career!  We decided to have kids and start our family!! I am now trying to get into the field and I really feel your channel will help me get there!!! Thanks so much!!!"
BIUFr9srS78,"I'm so proud of you and your journey is just amazing, I haven't reach the 50% of this episode but I'm amazed. Sorry I called u cutie earlier, I think u r tho"

Thank you for putting out the content you do, I've been following for a bit due to being curious about the data analyst role and each of your videos have helped me uncover more about being a data analyst and served to grow my interest from a sort of fling to having me seriously consider making the move while I'm in this personal life season of changing careers (I'm about to finish my MBA too!)

Again, thank you for having this channel, you're doing great work and helping a lot of people!"

Man, I love you’re journey towards becoming a data analyst from a field that’s totally unrelated! I’m actually hoping to follow the same footsteps! I’m a new dad too, and I’m currently studying sql, data analytics, and some python on the side in hopes of eventually landing a job in analytics! Currently taking the google data analytics prof. cert too, so I hope that helps! 

PS. on behalf of everyone that reached the end too, we love you as well! You’re a great teacher and inspiration!"

I’m looking into this career and it’s refreshing to hear from someone actually in the industry that isn’t just pushing these boot camps with no data to support their post-camp work opportunities.

Also, Pepper 🌶 😂"
BIUFr9srS78,"Pepper🌶 🤗 Hi Alex, I'm at a similar start point as you. I'm currently taking the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera while working on a contract using Salesforce. My background is mostly in the healthcare industry and have a BA in Sociology. It's great to see the end result of all the hard work. I will use your journey as motivation to keep studying and get my first job as a junior data analyst. Thank you for your videos😊"

BIUFr9srS78,Enjoy the channel.  Thanks for the content. . . . pepper
BIUFr9srS78,Pepper lol
BIUFr9srS78,"Hello Alex, 
Thanks for all your content; believe, it's very concise and valuable to anybody. 

I'd like to ask you (and everybody else who could help), some suggestions regarding how to move:
Goals:
- Work as Data Analyst (and maybe going on to something more Data science related, but that's to be thought)
- Work remotely (I don't have any particular wish concerning the country. Remote cause I wanna move on an island :D )
- gettin paid more compared to now (who wouldn't :D)

My Background:
- I'm 32yo, even if I don't have it written on my resume and people think I'm 8year younger  :D
- 4y experience as Business Analyst (doing Functional analysis an testing) in banking field
- knowledge of Excel, SQL and basics of Python, Tableau, ETL processes
- Bachelor degree in Economics where I got enough quantitative knowledge (especially Stats)
- Attended the Google Data Analytics 6 months course 
- languages: proficiency in Eng, Italian native, some French and German, too.


Thoughts:
I've tried some courses, in a way or in another, and I think that I'm tired to attend anything in which I always have to do the same basic things, since I think they won't get me anywhere. 
I wonder if I should attend something that's more 'seriours' and tough, rather than a simple course...but still, what and taught by who? 
It's then ok for me to pay 20/40€ a month for a course, even 1000/2000€ for a full course, but only if it really gives me a good boost. 
Maybe I should gather self-taught experience workiung on Kaggle datasets and then try to apply to a newbie job, even part-time. 
What would you think about getting into a low exp part-time job? Do you think I could ever be chosen? 

Anything I would do now, is something I woulds start to do part-time, since still got a full-time job, even if I got plenty of spare-time because I'm not always full of tasks and I work remotely. 

Then, would it have any sense to think to go on into Data science or would it take too much time wo master

I know it can seem pretty confusionary, but, working with data is something I truely prefer over Functional stuff but, since I had to start working, I took what the market offered me back then :). 

So....Suggestion? Is there anybody else who got the same problem?

Thanks in advance

Eric F."

_eZRkmRfVTM,"Timestamps for Conditional Formatting in Excel:
02:03 Using Icon sets, Color scales, Data Bars, Top/Bottom Rules
07:50 Duplicate Values
11:57 Text that Contains
14:13 Create custom rules: New Rule...
19:20 Outro"
_eZRkmRfVTM,I thank to Allah that I found you in Youtube!! Genuinely you are a  good man! and I hope you keep on doing this good work and thank you so much for sharing your knowledge!
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Before I just used duplicate values, Now I learned something new in conditional formatting and text that contain is also very useful. Thnx Alex"
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Hey, who wants to turn to Jesus and live for him obey everything he says? This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit. Also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't.

Do any of you need prayer?"
_eZRkmRfVTM,"I'm not sure why the first formula is not working for me for the date. I tried it like twenty times. Anyone else have this issue? Great video by the way, Alex!"
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Hi Alex and all,  I hope you are all doing well, you are my true inspiration Alex. I decide to be a data analyst last year after watching your video and then I got a job as an intern in PowerBI. THEN now I am working as a data analyst for another company. I am checking your videos and learning a lot. I would like to know one thing. I am working in the people & culture department they use only excel and powerbi which given a role called data analyst. They don't even use SQL, so can you tell without using SQL, is this a data analyst position.? guys just help me and give a response. Thanks"
_eZRkmRfVTM,small editing glitch @9:45 made me laugh idk why Lol.. so like names. Names. So like. So like names. Names.. xD
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Hi Alex, If you are reading this. Is this tutorial enough for getting a job as an data analyst? My first job"
_eZRkmRfVTM,Will you be doing Intro Power BI courses on your channel?  I have worked in a book on conditional formatting before.  I really enjoyed this course and understand how important those conditionals matter.  Especially when there are larger datasets involved.
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Hey Alex, is the course you keep returning to the ALL Excel Essentials Course?"
_eZRkmRfVTM,"That's a simple explanation to learn like always! Alex could you make a video about Power BI as well? that we could learn that more,
Many thanks."
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Thanks a lot alex, following your videos from Somaliland, you are a real hero, keep the good work 👍 Good content, easy to understand...cooool!"
_eZRkmRfVTM,Great But very short ! I wish  you had explained about $ ... that could be done in a couple of minutes !
_eZRkmRfVTM,thanks!
_eZRkmRfVTM,Thanks for the video Alex!
_eZRkmRfVTM,"The video is blurry especially the Excel screen view...I hope it improves. Faning your channel always regardless, thanks for the content"
_eZRkmRfVTM,I loved it thank you
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Great course as always! Easy to follow and pick up.Thank you, Alex! Will there be a power query course in the future?"
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Hi Alex, It's me Tareq from Bangladesh. Can you inform me ? Is it possible to be a data analyst as I am doing a job in a private bank? If I become a data analyst, will it help me to get remote job as a data analyst? Please, explain if possible? Thanks you."
_eZRkmRfVTM,Made the simplest things very confusing and over complicated
_eZRkmRfVTM,Is 8gb ram enough for Data analysis?
_eZRkmRfVTM,Hello alex i from India.. i am learning excel as of now. From where i can get data to play with excel tools. Simultaneously i am working on fundamental of statistics.. after excel what should be my next task... Please guide
_eZRkmRfVTM,"I thought I'd entered the Matrix at 9:45!

_eZRkmRfVTM,Special thanks for the Dunder Mifflin table!
_eZRkmRfVTM,Well explained
_eZRkmRfVTM,Alex we are not able to access 2 videos from the excel playlist....can you please have a look
_eZRkmRfVTM,"This is Cool Alex. I normally use the Shortcut *CTR+SHIT+L* for Filter, for turning On & Off. It really helped me save a lot time when working on a big Data. Thanks for very important tutorials."
_eZRkmRfVTM,Thanks you
_eZRkmRfVTM,thankyou so much Alex🥺❤️
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Hello.. 
Can I ask why 2 videos are private on MS Excel playlist?"
_eZRkmRfVTM,"Thanks Alex, I'm waiting for your Python course."

You are a saviour. Thank you!!!❤️"
s3JmRxs53W4,"congrats this channel will boom it is just about time, keep going and please we need more project bases tuts (real world datasets, real world projects to add to our resume along side those of the portfolio projects series, but more advanced please) and tnx a lotttt"
s3JmRxs53W4,MY fav and most honest DA.
s3JmRxs53W4,congratulations
s3JmRxs53W4,hey alex
s3JmRxs53W4,Ahhhh my favorite analyst!!! Dont lie you really are a CIA analysts
s3JmRxs53W4,"OMG, your live!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Alex I watched a lot of your videos, I just graduated from college this December. Yesterday I was given a job offer as a data analyst and I accepted it. Thank you for these videos, your efforts are appreciated 👍"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Thank you so much, Alex! This is encouraging. I am transitioning from teaching to data analytics and I am right on track with your timeframe here. I finished the Google Analytics course and now you are helping me with my portfolio. I have already worked on my resume and linked in, but have not reached out to a recruiter I will finish my portfolio and then watch your video on that. Thank you!!!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thanks Alex for your advice.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I am a systems technician but not as a career, as self-taught and have been in IT for almost 20 years. I want to change careers (I know it's never too late), and the data analyst part (as a researcher and report creation) really appeals to me. I am applying the knowledge I am picking up with the channels and with this order, I see more sense to the training. Many thanks to Alex and the community!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank you for this video! This is very Thorough. I love how you explained each step. Very clearly explained and it was easy to follow.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,I wanna get involved if anyone had any tips for a total beginner other than following said videos let me know I look forward to my journey 😊
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Alex, I want to become a Data analyst. And please I want you to put me through it all. I am total beginner."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hello Sir, Currently I'm doing Data center engineer,now I want to become a data analyst... kindly help me what is the good roadmap and can I get fresher job in data analyst..? and can I switch to as data analyst...?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,He's right. The Google Data Analyst feels way too easy. I'm already on the 4th course and it is way too slow paced for what I'm trying to do.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Great video! I'm going to dive into your channel. I am a licensed healthcare provider and hoping to transition to a health analyst role in the next year. 

I have been using LinkedIn since it's inception. A tip: get a professional headshot for your profile. My profile views ticked wayyyy up once I got a headshot done."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Please suggest online courses for learning Python for DA
yDG5KiiOZcQ,HI . I need the right path to become the data analyst. Please show me what steps should i take and what courses should i study. Thanks
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Data analysis hard skills : 
learn SQL 
learn visualization tools 
Excel 
Paython learn it last  cuz it’s the most tricky one"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Just found your channel today. This video is incredible. I jumped off the deep end and began learning Python a couple of months ago, and I’ve enjoyed it this far. 

Thank you for making this video."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,These are pretty outdated skill recommendations in my POV. 8 years ago this would be  good advice.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I've had this video in my ""watch later"" list for the whole year. Finally watched it today. I guess I have a problem with procrastination."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Youre the first youtube i know who mentioned people out of college.  Yes I just got out of college thankyou! Great videos indeed
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Hi Alex am in Kenya would like to be a data analyst. How do I go about it
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"maan, I am grateful you do exist.
Thank you❤"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex, I'm interested to become a Data Analyst and I was wondering if do you just do all courses at once or one at a time?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hello Alex. Thank you for that great video.
1. Are you sure that 2-3 months are enough to learn all the skills (Excel, SQL, Power BI and Python) at a level necessary to find a job? 
At first I thought you meant 2-3 months for one skill :P

2. Could you reveal which exact issues/aspects of each skill are the most important to learn?
Thank you for your informations! :)"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,I appreciate your videos. Thank you. Do you have any about freelancing?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hello, I have watched many of your videos. I learned a lot and it encouraged me to work as a data analyst. Thank you. I have good knowledge of SQL, Oracle Database, and I know MS Excel. Can I work as an entry level data analyst?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Can you compare the miniMaster from Georgia technical with UT post graduate certificate in data analyst? UT is more expensive but only 6 months short. Confused
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex! I have tried looking into multiple careers but i wasn't sure what i wanted, so i tried taking an aptitude test and the first thing that popped up was a data analyst. I was considering at least going to college for a certification in this field specificity. Problem is, I'm still hesitant that it's the right thing for me. What are the BIGGEST pros and cons of getting into this type of work?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hey Alex, if I’m in college preparing to become a data analyst, do I need an internship to have a good shot at entering this industry or is your list good enough? Thanks."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex,

There is certificate from MS called Power BI data analyst (PL-300) is it useful for the beginner, i want to start with it in shifting my career 😅"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,onramp has the whole SQL for free
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi, do you suggest starting with those individual courses or going straight into the Google course"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"You are awesome!! I was looking for my best route to jump on to this type of career and ima do exactly what you've discussed in this video, THANK YOU!!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"This video is really interesting! You made me start to look for a new career, I'll follow the steps you given. Thank you!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thanks for Guidence Alex and i will fillow this Roadmap to Become a Data Analyst
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Me... from the middle of no where... in Idaho haha
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank you loads Alex.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I'm new to your channel, and I just subscribed. I run a Virtual Executive  Assistant business, and I've been looking to niche into Data Analytics. Your video materials are very helpful and direct to the point, easy to learn by people like me who don't have any data analytics background. Thank  you!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I love your content man, thank you for sharing this"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Hi. I have zero background regarding data analysis. Do you have any videos on how I can teach myself to become one?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex, great video you've created! Question for you: If I'm going through the self teaching/certification route currently, and looking to switch from the Accounting field to the Financial Analytics field, do you believe that the barrier to entry would be hard just based off of resume and only having certifications and not a degree in something data science type of background? I have advanced excel skills but I didn't want to go further into student loans in school and still struggle with the Finance's barrier to entry. Thanks for your great videos!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Wow your channel has blown up! It's amazing! I remember watching your videos at beginning of the pandemic when I looking to switching from Accounting to Analytic works. Congrats on the great channel growth!
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Which one do you recommend, the IBM Data Analytics or the Google Data Analytics course and how are they different aside from being from 2 big companies?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,I want to become data analyst for freelancing.  Cause freelance working style life is better than other lifes in my opinion
yDG5KiiOZcQ,So glad I found your vids - this stuff is gold dust for me - expecting redundancy in the next 6 months and have always been more interested in the data side than my day to day tasks - this really helps me plan ahead for the inevitable- so thank you very much :)
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Hi alex i am beginner in data analytics field  i watched your all video can u make full course excel for data analytics
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"What would
You think is the age limit to learn this?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"when you start learning the skills first, is better to start out with learning the SQl or taking the Goggle certificate course ?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Suggest to use keywords such as ""Data Analyst"" in LinkedIn so recruiter/Headhunter can easily find you."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,what about R statistical Programming?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex,
Thanks for the helpful video, I really enjoyed the way you broke it down.
Can I still pursue a career as a Data Analyst with a bachelors degree in Business?
If yes, what other steps, aside from the instructions in this video, are required?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,I'm having a hard time doing the case study in the Google Data Analytics course. It's not that I can't perform the analysis but the course doesn't really tell you how to put it together in a portfolio.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank you so much! I am following you on this one step at a time. Appreciate your help.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I just changed my major form nursing to IT. After one whole year, I figured out I want to work in data analytics. It’s interesting, complex, and I enjoy it . Taking a google course rn and fingers crossed, hope I start working soon."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank you for the info. I'm currently a teacher and will be transitioning at the end of this school year. So it sounds like this is a good time to get started. Thanks again.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,i don't have any knowledge regards computer science. Since i'm 29 years old is it too late to change my career to become data analyst?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Just found your channel! I’m so excited!
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex! Nice vid for helping everyone out here, I have a question, I’m currently completing my Google Data Analytics and I want to pursue the IBM Data Analytics to further learn, but I read that the Python in the IBM is not comprehensive enough, that’s why I’m planning to get Python for everyone course by University of Michigan in Coursera, should I do that? Or just continue pursuing IBM Data Analytics? Thanks
in advance for your insight"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Spectacularly wrong. These are NOT skills. As with any  job, programming languages are... soft skills, and come way farther down the line. One should be learning what data are, how and what to collect, what kind of statistics mean what, and so on. If you don't know what to do, how can you learn the tools?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Hi alex. Was browsing through jobs and I chance upon your video. Do you recommend professional cert or a degree in data analytics? And do you recommend macOS or windowsOS for learning all the tools needed to become a data analyst? Thanks!
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Okay I need some enlightenment. I have over 7 years experience with data analysis (current business analyst), I have great skills in SQL, Excel, Power BI, Python. I have done projects. I have a good peer-reviewed resume. I have applied for over 1000 jobs in the past 5 months and had interviews with 3 companies. I practiced my interviewing skills and I don't think that is a huge issue (I mean I could be wrong). Please tell me I am not the only one, that this is a broad issue. I apply for data analyst, data scientist, and data engineering roles that I FULLY QUALIFY FOR but it goes no where. It sounds like I am complaining, and that is correct, sorry. I am just so tired."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,This is what I needed. Video saved and you got a new sub here. Thank you
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Hi Alex I want to transition from a network engineer to DA please adv will it be a good move?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,My resolution for the remaining part of 2022 is learning through to become a data analyst. Going to be following your videos to study. I believe it would help and impact knowledge
yDG5KiiOZcQ,One of the best YouTuber on data analytics! Thank you.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,How much can a data analyst make? Entry level and after 3-4 years?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex 
I have graduated in Mathematical Technology which is an applied sciences course with high back ground in Mathematics and statistics, and have Masters of Engineering in Quality  which has also  enough statistical technique packages. I would appreciate your assistance as someone who likes to work with numbers, i feel like these skills of data analysis are my next step. Thank you!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,I’m currently in accounting but I’m interested in becoming a Data analytics
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Thank Alex, you inspired me."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,your series or the google course? are they different? is one enough?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,How hard is it to break into the field with SOME university coursework but NO degree but a data analyst boot camp certificate ?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex, Thanks for the videos, you make such great effort. 
I was wondering can I shift my career from healthcare profession to data analysis? or my degree will not  allow me to do such thing"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank you for your channel! I myself graduated also with a bachelors degree with something completely unrelated to Data Analytics. I also have decided to change careers to support my family.  Thank you so much for this resource!! And making career changes possible!
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Thanks a lot. I thought an ETL tools shouldn't be missing for a future data analyst, such as Pentaho Kettle."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Is there a specific excel course on coursera that you recommend?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"This is great.
I have  been studying but this will definitely help me focus on 1 skill at a time.
Thank you."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex, hope you and your family are doing great. I just recently found you on YouTube and I’ve just began the Google Data Analytics course. I was wondering what your thoughts were on getting a Master’s in Data Science? Is it worth it? Will it help me with career opportunities or are the different courses/certifications offered online (coursera) enough? I have seen a few of your videos of how you got into data analytics, so I was just wondering what your thoughts were on pursuing a degree in the same field."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex, this is the second of your videos that I've watched, thank you for your sharing. I have a question, I've been an electrician/technician, for years, but I've been thinking about changing to a career where not many physical requirements are needed. Do you think a almost 40 years old guy could become a data analyst from scratch and find a job?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi, if I know python do I need to learn R ?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Gold!  Helpful and to the point.  Thanks, Alex!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"The total of 5 months to learn, 1 to 2 hours a day, would be 150-300 hours total. Full time, 40 hours a week, it would take you 3.75 to 7.5 weeks to complete, which is roughly 1-2 months."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Is it recommended for someone that had a degree on Agriculture begin learning data analytics?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Jalapeño
yDG5KiiOZcQ,You are so right. As a beginner I found the IBM course really difficult and so I’m now start with Google analytics certification.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thanks a lot for the informative video Alex!
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Can a 40 yr old stay at home mom still learn this skill?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,I am in Nigeria 🇳🇬. How can I get a remote job or relocate after I complete my training in Google Data Analyst professional
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I have 2 years of experience in SQL/SOQL, have developed an ACCESS database that communicated with Salesforce via API, and am good in Excel, & have started getting into Python. Currently looking into Tableu as well.
I have been applying like crazy but hardly hear back. I have included projects that I've done with SQL,  Salesforce, & ACCESS. I have no Bachelors degree. Do I need a Bachelors to be able to work as a Data Analyst?"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank You for your dedication.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"my son is pharmacist but he feel that he like these field , what do you recommends him"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I have been finding it challenging to get  started in the Data Analyst career.
I was in search on how to go about this and I came across your video which i found amazing.
It details out the various tracks and skills a Good Data Analyst needs to go through and obtain.
Thanks for this insightful video of yours @Alex the Analyst, i now have a clear roadmap to follow and a six months target to be an great Data Analyst and way beyond that."
yDG5KiiOZcQ,What about statistics?
yDG5KiiOZcQ,This was so helpful thank you so much
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"Hi Alex, I'm going into my last master's year in the field of Molecular Biology and Physiology. I'm looking to make a transition to Data Analysis (Data Analyst). I have decent knowledge in R(studio) and Excel and basic knowledge in Python. Also, I'm going to learn all the skills you mentioned in this video (SQL, PowerBI/Tableau, advanced Python).
You think it will be possible (with my current background) for me to make this transition to Data Analyst?


Thank you in advance and a great video!"
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Tnx
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thanks Alex. This was very helpful
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Another awesome video!  Be great if at the end you could just add the position titles you'd be looking for after having this experience and also a salary range for those entry level jobs and maybe just touch on job positions/titles and salaries down the road?  Thanks again.
yDG5KiiOZcQ,Thank you so much Alex your video helped me a lot
yDG5KiiOZcQ,So I have to be smart and be good at math? Fml
yDG5KiiOZcQ,"I'm a pharmacy student on my 5th year, i really found myself attracted to the domain of data analysis and i would like to get a foot into ii so i can  develop my career because i think gaining data analysis skills will open a lot of opportunites in my pharmaceutical career ."

Z7hPEwCzk2s,thank you i am going to interview with super store at australia
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Good job, sir.
Please, can you provide the link for this dataset?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,I've got a WhatsApp group for us that are just starting up just like me. And I am willing to find that studying community where we progress using my mentor Alex the analyst!
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"I'm no expert but for the xlookup mulitple rows. If you want to select different rows and they are not side by side, you can select the first row, hold ctrl and then select the other rows while still holding ctrl"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,how can i get the dataset you are using?
Z7hPEwCzk2s,nice nice great do more alex
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Ended day 2 here
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Thanks Alex. I've been using Excel for many years now and I've always been using V or H lookup. Now I understand why the X lookup came about. Thanks for making it simple!
Z7hPEwCzk2s,where can i download this particular dataset
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hi Alex, in my Excel, XLOOKUP doesn't work. So, how am I doing for that tutorial? Can you help me?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,How can i practice this on my excel2013??
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Thank you, Alex. One video per day, and I will soon get there. Happy Mother's month to every woman out there trying to break barriers."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Great work Alex, pls how do i get the Dataset for the xlookup class"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"My excel is an older version and so I couldn’t do Xlookup but i tried to do vlookup instead but I got an error and I believe I entered the right formula.
Is there a reason why that happened?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Thanks, Alex."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,I enjoyed this tutorial. Thank you Mr Alex.
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Hi Alex! Some of us don't have the higher versions of excel so can you please make another video of you doing the same things with index/match. I already learned it from other resources but I think it will be more beneficial for other people following this bootcamp that don't have excel 2019. Thanks a lot for everything tho 
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Thanks for the tutorial, really useful.
3:50
You should have locked the lockup and return arrays"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"The Office characters, I actually loved this"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Shouldn't the next best date to ""1/1/2000"" be ""7/4/2000""?
Please clarify."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"As a data Quality Control specialist, in our organization we use macros to check data inconsistencies. Your Excel videos have really changed how approached my quality checks using excel functions using INDEX MATCH, VLOOKUP, IF/IFS and others to automate my Excel Sheet. Planning to use your way by creating new macros from scratch in my next project moving forward.

Kudos @AlexTheAnalysit! You've made Excel to look soooo easy. Many thanks🤗."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,which version of excel are you using Alex
Z7hPEwCzk2s,getting the dataset as being a challenge. @alex with this.
Z7hPEwCzk2s,13:49 How about if months are not next to each other? Like I want to add up March and June?
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"for Vlookup, we need to place the formula in every single cell in order to get more info from the row. thanks for it."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hey guys I used this for Xlookup Sum 
=SUM(INDEX(H2:S2,MATCH(I1,H1:S1,0)),INDEX(H2:S2,MATCH(J1,H1:S1,0)))
I used this very long boring code because my excel is not paid so I can't use Xlookup"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Hello @Alex The Analyst my excel does not have the function of an XLOOKUP what do I do
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Hi Alex I love your videos easy to understand and very engaging
Z7hPEwCzk2s,What about HLOOKUP?
Z7hPEwCzk2s,✅
Z7hPEwCzk2s,it  is important lock ranges (use F4) before generating the formula for the rows below
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Xlookup does not appear as a function here. people say that it is only for  Office365 subscriber licenses.
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Why can i copy the formula like the way you copy yours 😢
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"At ""10:22 second"", for Match mode=1, why the output is 1/5/2000 when the next larger value to 1/1/2000 is 7/4/2000? (considering that the date is in dd/mm/yyyy format)"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,I think we should use F4 or add dollar sign ($) to lock the range before double click to automate applying the function for below rows
Z7hPEwCzk2s,If you're unable to find xlookup function in Excel then try the same in Google sheets ☺️( like my comment if you found it helpful)
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"The xlookup formular isn't working on my excel, is there like a particular version of excel to use for it..........vlookup is working tho"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"I can't find an XLOOKUP formula in Excel, I can only find LOOKUP. And it doesn't have the same description when entering tap. Any idea why?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"I understand, I’m just unsure how is this feature used in the field?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,D13 of my yt bootcamp
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"For those having error on the XLookUp Multiple Rows, someone here commented ""add ( & ) sign between the two outputs you want like this (=XLOOKUP(A3,I2:I10,O2:O10&P2:P10) and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter at the end"". That returned the date and email for me, but it put them both in the same cell instead of separate ones like in the video"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,5:11
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hi Alex, thanks for the videos, been really helpful. But can you assist with the files? They seem to be missing in GitHub. Thanks"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Thank you alex ❤
Z7hPEwCzk2s,HII Alex do we not need VLOOKUP for Data Analysis?
Z7hPEwCzk2s,its easy to understand..
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Till today I didn't focused much on Xlookup, and was only using V and Hlookup formulas, but now i got to Know
  Xlookup is a different beast"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hello Sir, In every single time when you used drag for the next names to auto fill-up there is a single mistake. As you drags down the range array is also changing by 1 row. so after any random search at the second time if we search for the first person we will get error or the message ""Nor found"" as the range is now changed. And for that we need to fix the range and return array values so that it searches within the same exact column and do not misses any upward values. Am i Right? I'm a big fan of yours as what you did is awesome. Please reply if possible."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Guys, I used this for the February-March sum
=SUM(XLOOKUP(I1:J1,H1:S1,H2:S2))
apparently, the search item can also be a range.😎"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Great video Alex.
I want to know what is the workaround if you want to return 2 or more values which match the search?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"23/74
Lets go!!!"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,THANK YOU.
Z7hPEwCzk2s,THANK YOU.
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"My Excel don't have XLOOKUP it's just LOOKUP, when I try multiple rows and Exact match it doesn't work. What souled I do ????????"

Z7hPEwCzk2s,I really can't understand that xlookup exact match for beasely and Meredith. Could someone explain it to me in a simple way please.
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hey Alex,

Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Thanks Alex for an amazing course!

I have a little comment regarding the formula. I think ""$"" should be added for a fix range. For example, in tab ""XLookUp"", the range H2:H10 and P2:P10 should be fixed. Therefore, the formula should be =XLOOKUP(A3;$H$2:$H$10;$P$2:$P$10), and then it can be applied to other below cells."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,hai mr alex i have a doubt i am not able to use xlookup in my pc can you please tell me hoe to use it
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Awesome . I had check out alot of data analysis courses on youtube but your teaching sytle is the best
Z7hPEwCzk2s,THANK YOU
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Thanks a ton Alex
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Thanks for the video, but I have a question for the VLOOKUP part, why do I get #N/A result if I write the formula like this: =VLOOKUP(A5;E1:P10;12;FALSE). what's wrong with the table array range?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Legendary content sir, thanks alot, also loved the office reference with the names lol"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hi Alex 
Please i need a more deep dive into different lookup functions. Would you be kind enough to send me some Udemy courses you’d recommend that’ll really be beneficial to me?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Why xlookup isn't working now today 2024
Z7hPEwCzk2s,The file for this tutorial isn't downloading

Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hey Alex,
Learning alot from your videos,
Your simplicity is truly inspiring.❤"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hello, When I typed in the XLOOKUP formular I kept getting NAME? as a result. Please how do I solve this?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,Brilliant tutorial
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"If anybody is having trouble with XLOOKUP Exact Match try it with =IFNA( XLOOKUP(A3,H2:H10,O2:O10),""Not Found"")
it worked for me."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"5:00 when i use this same exact formula, it doesnt work. it just says #N/A"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,i can't found this function XLOOKUP over in my excel how can i add it ?
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"the formula  =XLOOKUP(A3,I2:I10,O2:P10)  is not working for me, it's showing me an error message ""#value!"""
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"pls Alex what is the different between xlookup,xlookup exact match xlookup search order,need more clearification,if someone can explain better on the comment"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,I keep getting an value error for the xlookup formula for multiple rows
Z7hPEwCzk2s,i want to download the raw file but it is  not dowloading from github please help me 
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"I got this solution to value error from the net;

When using XLOOKUP with multiple rows, the result may be an array of values rather than a single value. If you enter the formula in a single cell, and the result is an array, it will return a #VALUE error.
Solution: To handle the array result, you need to enter the formula as an array formula by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing the formula. This will enclose the formula in curly braces {} and allow it to return multiple results.
For example, if you want to get the corresponding values from columns O and P for each matched row in column I, you can use the following array formula:
=XLOOKUP(A3, I2:I10, O2:O10&P2:P10)



and it worked for me"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hi guys! , When I choose multiple columns as the return array, I get ""#Value!"" Error. Can someone help me?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,THANK YOU Alex! I've decided to write a gratitude comment in every one of your videos as an appreciation for everything you've done for all of us as well as offer feedback/thoughts on each video. I liked how you explained how the VLOOKUP function is used in Excel and the benefits of XLOOKUP/comparison to VLOOKUP. I can't believe all the time and energy you've put into this Bootcamp series. You are AWESOME!
Z7hPEwCzk2s,I used to use vlookup a lot and this video about xlookup has helped me think better on my solutions. Thanks!
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"hello alex, when im using xlookup for multiple rows its showing value error.
how to resolve it any 1 or alex please tell me.
Thank you"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"For the section of XlookUp-Multiple Rows, anyone getting spill error for end date?? Please let me know.."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"when i do the xlookup for multiple rows  or anthing with a date in it i get a '#value!' why? 
how do I fix this?"
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"Hi Alex, Thank you so much for your excel tutorials. I was practicing on this template and I noticed something. The lookup array and the returned array keeps on changing as we move down looking up for more value. We did not run into error(#na) in the video because the items are arranged well.  At first I ran into trouble but then I remembered the F4 lock. Locked the lookup array and the returned array such that it does not run into an error by searching empty array. 
Just wanted to share how exciting the experience was!

Thank you."
Z7hPEwCzk2s,"I am doing exactly what you're doing at 04:57 in video, yet my Excel is giving me an error ""A value used in the formula is of the wrong data type"" when I hit ENTER after typing the formula. Please help."

lH7HfwUFnYA,is it normal if i started with excel before MYSQL
lH7HfwUFnYA,"Mi tried learning from several youtube channels but i failed however you are just fantastic and your quick video work likes magic
Thank You Alex"
lH7HfwUFnYA,HOW TO GET THE DATASHEET OR EXCEL TO PRACTICE PLEASE HELP?
lH7HfwUFnYA,❤❤❤
lH7HfwUFnYA,"So helpful, thanks for making the nice tutorial."
lH7HfwUFnYA,Is it me that finds it blurred.  I can't even see the places he's clicking
lH7HfwUFnYA,Now I can finally say I'm proficient in Excel on my resume THANK YOU!! lmao
lH7HfwUFnYA,thanks for the calculated field function.
lH7HfwUFnYA,"I'm completely new to excel, anyone tell when selecting the sum % of grand total why does it shows 0% completely"
lH7HfwUFnYA,Does he provide the dataset he is using in the video for hands on experience?
lH7HfwUFnYA,"Hello @Alex, am looking for PIVOT in SQL, do you have the course ready? please"
lH7HfwUFnYA,As far as I can tell only the desktop paid version has calculated fields. I'm running on web based 365 version of excel so if I'm wrong in saying that the web version doesn't offer calculated fields I'd be happy to hear it.
lH7HfwUFnYA,lit
lH7HfwUFnYA,"Amazing video, very well explained. Thank you so much👏"
lH7HfwUFnYA,"veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery useful video, thank you so much 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹"
lH7HfwUFnYA,Wow Pivots have never been this easy
lH7HfwUFnYA,as soon as he said 50 videos i  immediately check i thought i clicked wrong playlist
lH7HfwUFnYA,Hey bro how did i get that data
lH7HfwUFnYA,"I had tried for one hour, and for me, pivot option don't work and control-shift arrow also doesn't work. I use Excel 2016 and also try with Excel online and nothing."
lH7HfwUFnYA,"With displaying the revenue per year, is there a quick way of finding a percentage increase as per a base year or a previous year in the same pivot table instead of the actual revenue values?
Here's is what I mean
2013| 2014|
13.2%| 10.2%|
To mean that revenue increased by 13.2% from 2012 to 2013, and then from 2013 to 2014 it increased by 10.2%.
I am new to Excel, I don't know how I am going to do this"

zOR0-nygfDE,I have a question !! before jumping to create visualizations isnt it better to clean the data are these datasets are already clean?
zOR0-nygfDE,For those trying to explore the latest data make sure to first check the calender file if it has some data !!! some are empty
zOR0-nygfDE,"Hi Alex, was wondering if you can help me. I've tried to filter the data as you showed so that on tableau it only shows data from 2016. It's taking hours to prepare the data. How can i sort this issue out? I'm. using Macbook air and also using tableau public"
zOR0-nygfDE,Great tutorial
zOR0-nygfDE,done 32/84
zOR0-nygfDE,Thank you Sir!
zOR0-nygfDE,"In measure its not showing any price. So , i converted dimension to measure for price but its still not showing average option as shown in the video"
zOR0-nygfDE,"Really amazing :), Sir"
zOR0-nygfDE,Can someone explain me the steps he did to prepare the dataset(s) for the project? What I achieved was to gunzip the three files into csv files but now he merged them into one. Does someone know which steps I need to take to have a similar dataset? My idea is to use a newer dataset for another city. Thanks!
zOR0-nygfDE,"Alex create Joins between listings and calendar and remove reviews but mine is not going still it says tableau publi only works with less than 1,000,000 rows of data. Your data exceeds this limit. Add filter below to reduce the number of rows to import...
Please how do I go about this Abeg any one to help"
zOR0-nygfDE,"I’m having issue plz and the issue is that I want to create joins between listings and calendars but it’s still showing what it show when Alex want to create join ma between listings, calendar and Reviews"
zOR0-nygfDE,"Loved everything about this lesson, I've learnt a lot from your channel .Thanks"
zOR0-nygfDE,"Seattleite here. Zero bedrooms means it's a studio. Totally legit. This video is so helpful, thank you so much!"
zOR0-nygfDE,"In my map, it does not show any color and I didn't fix it. Could you please tell me about this problem?"
zOR0-nygfDE,Alex the main man🔥🔥
zOR0-nygfDE,In 17:18 price is not available for me. ?
zOR0-nygfDE,how do i add this to my portfolio?... i think you should do a video explaning how to add all these projects to our portfolio website
zOR0-nygfDE,I'm trying to use this sample data and cannot get the calendar to open. When I download the calendar.csv.gz it opens a folder with individual data in the folder instead of being able to open in excel like the other ones. Any suggestions on how to get it correctly?
zOR0-nygfDE,"Thank You so much to this point, but cant seem to find the Tableu project on github"
zOR0-nygfDE,"H! When I try to open a new sheet, I get this error. Has this happened to anyone else?""Unable to complete action
Internal Error - An unexpected error occurred and the operation could not be completed.
Error Code: 44A7CD32"". Thanks"
zOR0-nygfDE,i cannot find the zipcode data in the listings dataset. How to resolve this problem?
zOR0-nygfDE,t and f means true and false? available = true/false
zOR0-nygfDE,DONE!!!
zOR0-nygfDE,thanks alex !!
zOR0-nygfDE,thanks
zOR0-nygfDE,Thanks Alex !
zOR0-nygfDE,"Im guessing that this had already been answered somewhere in the hundreds of comments - but - when I drag the zipcode to columns it tells me on the bottom right of the map that I have 27 nulls and not 1. I dont get any highlighting over the area. Not sure if it understands the zipcodes properly maybe ? Dont know that being in Australia should make a difference but could be the cause...
thanks in advance for any assistance 🙂"
zOR0-nygfDE,20:00
zOR0-nygfDE,I don't know if anybody told you this Alex but you have a great voice. It is kind of distracting even like it is so good.
zOR0-nygfDE,"When I try to save it to Tableau Public, it asks me to extract the data, and the extraction process takes a lot of time. Any suggestions?"
zOR0-nygfDE,"I made sure to like and comment before even going through the tutorial cuz I'm coming from a 17 minutes video on tableau and I'm sure this one is even more beneficial. 
Best of luck"
zOR0-nygfDE,For those who can't visualize the map you have to modify the geographic role. Right click on the map field > edit locations > change the country/region based on the data resource you'll use.
zOR0-nygfDE,Tips: When you have dragged your tables to column or rows. And you want those Rows for to be in the 'Marks' section too. You can just simply 'CTRL + drag' into the Marks Section. That way it will make the copy instead of removing it from the row/column tab. This is easier to navigate since the table column have a lot of overwhelming data to scroll through.
zOR0-nygfDE,i am not able to do map (second sheet) i tried different ways but is not getting marked in map
zOR0-nygfDE,Thanks Alex!
zOR0-nygfDE,"For those using the current data, what did you use instead of zip codes? I've playing around with the longitude, latitude, and neighborhood_cleansed data but it doesn't provide a clean map from sheet 2 shown from the video."
zOR0-nygfDE,"Thanks a lot man! 
Really a great series of videos to learn Tableau. I just did it in just a day and am decently confident enough."
zOR0-nygfDE,"I downloaded the updated data, but the graph showing the price per week didn’t work as expected. After some troubleshooting, I noticed that the Price field included the $ symbol, which prevented Tableau from recognizing it as a number.
To fix it, I went to analysis -> created a calculated field using the formula: FLOAT(RIGHT([Price (Calendar.Csv)], LEN([Price (Calendar.Csv)]) - 1))
That worked for me, but I noticed your dataset also had the $ symbol, yet you didn’t seem to encounter this issue. Did anyone else run into this problem? I'm curious if there's a different way to handle this."
zOR0-nygfDE,'t' and 'f' stand for true and false...
zOR0-nygfDE,"Hey Alex, thanks for the detailed video, i find it very helpful :)"
zOR0-nygfDE,Thanks Alex sir for this Great Project.
zOR0-nygfDE,"Thank you Alex
God bless you, Amen."
zOR0-nygfDE,You are the goat. Big thanks i learn step by stp.
zOR0-nygfDE,"This video is amazing!! I was trying to use updated data, but is so big for put this data in a Excel and then work on Tableu. Any advice on how I could use large amounts of data?"
zOR0-nygfDE,"i had error while opening the sheet can someone explain what is wrong with that 
""Unable to complete action
Internal Error - An unexpected error occurred and the operation could not be completed.
Error Code: 44A7CD32""
this was the error message"
zOR0-nygfDE,This was very fun and worth learning thanks Alex!
zOR0-nygfDE,"at 33:42 should wee take ""host id"" instead of ""id"". because distinct count of host id will give us exact no of hosts right?
can somebody help me out in this pls?"
zOR0-nygfDE,I downloaded dataset from insideairbnb but listing csv does not contain zipcode.
zOR0-nygfDE,Thank you so much Alex

zOR0-nygfDE,Thank you very much sir
zOR0-nygfDE,"Hey Alex, Good Day. I keep getting this message after my join at about 13:00, ""Unable to complete action
Internal Error - An unexpected error occurred and the operation could not be completed.
Error Code: 44A7CD32"" could you please help me out?
Thank You."
zOR0-nygfDE,I really wanna thank you on this huge effort. you changed my life
zOR0-nygfDE,"Thanks for the amazing videos, Alex. Much appreciated.   Quick question though: I tried joining just the Listing and Calendar as shown in the video but I’m getting an error message that “Tableau Public only works with less than 1 million rows of data”. It’s not 15 million for me. I even tried the Date filter of just the 2016 data, that too is more than 1 million rows of data. How should I go about this?"
zOR0-nygfDE,"Please can someone help me out, I  filter it to 2016 but got no results i have been on this for the past two days help me"
zOR0-nygfDE,"Hi Alex, don't you think that the first and second viz just show the exact same info, so maybe we could just use one of them instead of two to avoid repetition.
Anyways, much appreciation to you and your amazing content !"
zOR0-nygfDE,Learn a lot from your videos. Thanks alot Alex
zOR0-nygfDE,"27:00 Hello got question about this interpretation - I think it doesnt show the quantity of renting because the price is different in different airbnb, for example one night for 1000 show, that more people traveled this day than 10 people for 20 $ in this visualization. Was the correct way to set Count(price) ? It would show the rows(number of rentings) ?"
zOR0-nygfDE,Still moving forward
zOR0-nygfDE,"Thank you so much Alex for all the wonderful content, I started watching your videos last year March 2023. All the content is short, crisp and easily understood. I completed Excel, SQL, Power BI and Tableau videos from the Data Analyst Bootcamp Playlist. Many more things to learn from you until I get a job in Data Domain. God bless you!"
zOR0-nygfDE,"What a great tutorial on Tableau. I had taken a course elsewhere and felt really confused. I came across your video and just in a day I was able to go through the Five videos.  My  goodness you make it really easy!!!! Thank you Alex, you are a saviour in Data Analysis.  I will be watching all your videos. Sure will be a professional  by the time I am done.

zOR0-nygfDE,"00:00 🛠 This video is the final installment in a beginner Tableau tutorial series, focusing on a complete project.
00:46 🎨 The project aims to cover basics but offers insights into various visualizations and data analysis techniques.
01:56 📊 The project uses an Airbnb dataset, specifically the Seattle Airbnb open dataset, with listings, pricing, and reviews.
02:53 📈 The data has been consolidated into one CSV file and made available on GitHub for ease of access.
04:29 💡 Understanding the data columns is crucial as not all data may be relevant for visualization.
06:04 🧩 Proper understanding of data relationships is essential for accurate data joining and analysis.
07:15 🔍 Data manipulation, such as filtering and joining, ensures accurate visualization creation.
10:50 🔄 Checking and confirming joins is vital to ensure correct data integration.
12:30 📉 Removing unnecessary data helps optimize visualization creation and processing speed.
15:44 🏡 The project's use case involves optimizing Airbnb listings based on factors like location and pricing.
17:58 🎨 Creating visualizations, such as price by zip code, helps identify optimal locations for Airbnb listings.
18:39 🗺 Maps can be created using location data like latitude and longitude to visualize distribution and patterns.
19:20 🔍 When working with zip code data in Tableau, ensure consistency and separate zip codes for better visualization.
21:13 🎨 Visualizations in Tableau can be enhanced by adding labels and average price information for better understanding.
23:20 🏡 Analyzing the best times for Airbnb listings can be done using time series data in Tableau to identify peak periods of demand.
32:52 💰 The number of bedrooms significantly impacts Airbnb prices, with larger homes commanding higher prices per night.
35:40 📊 Visualizing competition for Airbnb listings by the number of bedrooms can provide insights into market demand and competition.
40:17 📊 Completing the dashboard layout in Tableau by arranging visualizations and discussing its potential for answering questions and generating further inquiries.
41:54 💻 Sharing the Tableau dashboard to Tableau Public for easy access and viewing by others, encouraging viewers to explore the provided link for personal use or comparison.
43:07 📈 Encouraging viewers to utilize the Kaggle data for additional fields and explore different data points to create unique dashboards and visualizations for their portfolios."
zOR0-nygfDE,"Your teaching style is awesome! I appreciate your thoroughness , thank you!"
zOR0-nygfDE,thank you alex learned alot and created my tableau dashboard
zOR0-nygfDE,"Airbnb has taken down the zipcodes from the updated datasets. For anyone who's having trouble visualizing the map due to this, you can make something similar by putting Longitude on columns and Latitude on rows. Good luck, everyone!"
zOR0-nygfDE,"O wow! thank you so much this is really insightful But a quick question how do i generate the zipcode, i got the original data with the intention of redoing the entire project myself but there isnt any zipcode in the listings, how can i get the zipcodes?"
zOR0-nygfDE,Thank you! This was very informative. Great introductory to Tableau!
zOR0-nygfDE,"I have a question regarding the 'Avg price per bedroom' chart. Does it mean that for 6-bedroom properties, the average listed price per bedroom is $584.8? It doesn't seem right for such a high price for just one bedroom. It seems more reasonable to say that the average price for 6-bedroom properties is $584.8, pricing the bedrooms as a whole. If this is the case, shouldn't the title of the chart be something like 'Average price by bedroom number'? 
It's just a little confusing for me to analyze the data."
zOR0-nygfDE,Great tutorial! You are a great teacher! I love how you solve errors and explain them as simple as it is....I will continue with your bootcamp and other courses you have on your channel. Congrats Alex!
zOR0-nygfDE,guys i am not able to save the project it says free tablue limit is 15M how i can save this data
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 31 / 84"
A4SVUF-fTwc,done 31/84
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thanks for your work !! 
A4SVUF-fTwc,great work! thank you.
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hi Alex, I just wanted to say that your tutorials are amazing! I recently took a data analytics course on Coursera that covered Tableau, but your tutorial provides much more detailed explanations and features. Thank you for what you do👍"
A4SVUF-fTwc,files can't be downloaded on GitHub
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great video.
A4SVUF-fTwc,where is the excel file?
A4SVUF-fTwc,Wow! Joins! I am enlightened
A4SVUF-fTwc,"i watched the full SQL series beforehand, so that lecture was A piece of cake"
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great thanks
A4SVUF-fTwc,I did not know that Dwight earns almost the same as michale scott XD
A4SVUF-fTwc,THANKS
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you
A4SVUF-fTwc,"But like if i have null in my tableau, it means I was doing something wrong in my SQL/Excel"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hello Aled sir, Thank you so much for this tutorial. I learned tableau in a very easy way. I was facing a problem for 2 months and by these 5 parts I got it. Thank you to adding each feature, especially you are elabarating each types like average, sum, count why they using. Good job"
A4SVUF-fTwc,ahahah Assistant to the Regional Manager for Dwight love it
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Very good video, with a great explanation! thanks!"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"I was so scared of joins but I have learned joins from your sql video in my semester break , Now joins are on my finger tips .Since my concept are clear , this video was so easy to follow up ."
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Great summary of joins! I love the way you explain all of these concepts and functions so clearly. It makes learning wayyyyy more fun. As always, THANK YOU!"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"I have already learned a lot about joins from your sql course and other sql courses, but in this video, the part where you join the demographics and job title tables via employee name is such a clear and clever way of explaining again how the joins work. It consilidated my understanding for joins. Way to go alex!"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Thank you for this tutorial, I am really learning a lot. Apart from this tutorial but Mr. Alex you are really good looking which gives some of us hope to keep on learning............."
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank You Alex I am mastering Tableau because of you!
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you Alex
A4SVUF-fTwc,not a sheer one.
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Any chance of explaning please the benefits of joining a table to itself in Tableau, and how that's useful?"
A4SVUF-fTwc,I'm sincerely grateful for the video. I have learnt something new (joins) today. God bless you.
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Apparently, since this video has been posted, they've updated Tableau. Now, it spits out all the join info for you automatically. I'm going to do many things, but complain ain't one of them."
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hahaha Alex, I just want to say. You explained JOINs better than the Google Course 🤣"
A4SVUF-fTwc,orrrr just use sql
A4SVUF-fTwc,Not able to download the file from git
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Aren't joins easiest & best in SQL, then in excel power query, & least in Tableau?"
A4SVUF-fTwc,I'm unable to download the join file from github
A4SVUF-fTwc,I'm not sure to understand why not simply doing relations instead of joins ? (still new to Tableau but experienced with PowerBI)
A4SVUF-fTwc,Big thanks for your video Alex.
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Thanks so much Alex 
However I need help!!! My joined table is not showing but rather it's saying ""data preview unavailable"" what do I do please 
Pov I am using Tableau public"
A4SVUF-fTwc,I watched the whole tutorial. This is much appreciated thank you.
A4SVUF-fTwc,Done
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Alex, you explained the joins very clearly. Thank you so much"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Alex, you look much better without those glasses =).  What I do not understand about this example is:  Does it assume that the user is aware (or unaware) of the missing data?  I would have to think that if one was aware of the missing data, the better option is to simply update the original data source, so if the user were unaware of the data issue, what is your suggestion as to how this would materialize during the selection of Joins?  (In this example, I believe you were searching for it only because you were aware of it, so just questioning how obvious it might be for the average, unaware user.). Thank you."
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Great vid. At first, I hated everything about joins BUT since I learned them its make Tableau so much easier! Keep the vid coming your amazing!"
A4SVUF-fTwc,love the fact that you play League of Legends
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Oh, you play League of Legends. Nice to know lol"
A4SVUF-fTwc,My Measures and Tables didn't get the names of the Excel file tabs. I have no idea why.
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thanks♡♡
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank a million for sharing. Your tutorial is helpful for me.
A4SVUF-fTwc,Alex The Goat
A4SVUF-fTwc,"13:30 man, Michael Scott's salary is super low for being the boss man. 😄  lol.  Great tutorial Alex!"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Understandably explained, thank you!"
A4SVUF-fTwc,Where do we get the Tableau Joins file at????    Help      Are we supposed to be following along?  Where is the file at?    Thanks in advance
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Love the reference from ""The Office"" with character names, haha."
A4SVUF-fTwc,Just realising that those where The Office employees. Awesome!
A4SVUF-fTwc,Alex now that we know you play League of Legends... what rank are you?
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Your tableau join file has an ""xlsx"" extension. It does not download correctly. Maybe you meant ""xls""."
A4SVUF-fTwc,Loved the fact that you are using tables with information about the characters from the office. I like you more just for that
A4SVUF-fTwc,How do we join the data if they are from two separate files?
A4SVUF-fTwc,"so you made the joins but for the visualisation you didnt use it, correct ? or am i understanding this wrong ?"
A4SVUF-fTwc,when will be the remaining part is going to be uploaded?
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hi,
Can you make a video on difference between Busi. Analyst and Management information systems?
Really confused about these 2"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Hi Alex,
But off topic, but I have a question about learning my data analytics skills. I am currently learning Python. Now I saw you highly recommended the Google data analytics course. Is it worth to do both courses simultaneously? Or should I choose on or another? Side note, until the end of the year I can work full time on courses."
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Can you make an in depth video on data granularity and LOD's(ok, two :)? Found these topics of great importance for understanding Tableau and its power"
A4SVUF-fTwc,Is Your enough Tableau Interview
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thank you very much Alex for this useful tutorial
A4SVUF-fTwc,Please upload microstrategy tutorial videos aswell. The youtube has very less content about it.
A4SVUF-fTwc,I check your page everyday waiting for the next tableau tutorial. Thanks a lot Alex.
A4SVUF-fTwc,"I have a question not about tableau. I just wanted to ask you and this was your latest video.
The question is there is a path in LinkedIn Learning to become a Data Analyst and it is for free and was there before Google Certificate and IBM too. 
But no one talk about it and if it is good or not, if it is updated or it is old for nowadays data analyst career, and a comparison between the 3 of them.
And a small tip for google and IBM, we don't have jobs we do not have money to bay for Coursera why do not make the full course on your site if u do not get any revenue from Coursera"
A4SVUF-fTwc,"Thank you, it helps me a lot."
A4SVUF-fTwc,I wake up in the morning to a new tutorial vid! Thank you!
A4SVUF-fTwc,Great tutorial 🙌🏼
A4SVUF-fTwc,Thanks you 🙏

FnTunxd8tAM,"I'm currently interviewing for another data analyst role. I rarely ever use SQL in my role, mostly use Tableau, GTM or GA Looker Studio, other visual tools. I've had 12 years in creating high ROI digital marketing campaigns,  so when I became a Data Analyt,  it still baffles me why there needs to be so many visualization tools to make educated marketing decisions on how to optimize campaigns  (Python, SQL,  GA4, R, Tableau, Power BI, etc, etc). Truely, in all my years doing digital analytics,  we rarely ever used all these tools. So many exceptional data anaysts are passed over because the hiring manager is hung up on specific tools that are rarely used and specific tasks  can be taught to almost anyone. It feels like hiring managers are looking for unicorns, but they just a need a reliable horse 😂"
FnTunxd8tAM,I have seen so many entry level jobs that ask for 3 to 5 years experience
FnTunxd8tAM,I am in one now like you were
FnTunxd8tAM,"I came across an entry level accounting job from concentra career choice. Some of the job description contained the following:

“The Staff Accountant will be responsible for account reconciliations and other projects as assigned. This position is entry level and requires someone with eagerness, enthusiasm and problem-solving skills. This position will report directly to the Accounting Senior Manager. They will ensure the delivery of exceptional customer service by putting all customers (internal and external first and displaying:
• A healing focus
 • A selfless heart
 • A tireless resolve
I was like is this accounting position or am I also going to be doing mental counseling for l others and eventually myself 😂"
FnTunxd8tAM,"Other red flag phrases to look out for:

""Family environment"" = Gaslighting and other manipulation tactics runs rampant.

""Attention to details"" = Your boss will start the papertrail if you make even the most minor mistake.

""Must work well under pressure"" = You will be under chronic stress

""Fast-paced"" = Unreasonable deadlines and never ending work

""Multitasking"" = You will do the work of fifty people.

""Self-starter"" = Boss is a boomer that believes in ""pull yourself from your own bootstraps"" when you're thrown to the wolves day one.

""Show initiative"" = Boss is a boomer that  believes in ""if there's time to lean there's time to clean"" instead of delegating work.

""Problem solver"" = Your competency will be questioned if you ask a single question.

""Fast growing"" and ""disrupting X industry"" = Expect mass layoffs."
FnTunxd8tAM,When they say we want you to have “tough skin”
FnTunxd8tAM,Thank you Alex for the enlightenment!!!
FnTunxd8tAM,"Another is if they mention H1B Visas. 

Stay Away!! Far away. You’ll get stuck in a department of mud"
FnTunxd8tAM,"I don't like working M-F 8-5, so flexible hours sounds really attractive, but I've never done it before. Would that be a good option in my case?"
FnTunxd8tAM,Being the first or only person in a role can be very tricky
FnTunxd8tAM,Please make a video on how to prepare for data analyst interviews
FnTunxd8tAM,2:15 I'm on the 7th course of the Google Data Analytics Program and I'm really afraid of that. The course teaches a lot of skills and sometimes it's just too overwhelming and I'm always thinking that I will be expected to know EVERYTHING when I start applying for jobs and I have already forgotten a lot of what I learned in the previous courses. 😅
FnTunxd8tAM,Thank You Sir for your guidance. I'm a fresher looking for data analyst jobs and your videos about your experience give me a lot to guidance about what to look for in job profiles and how to build a good portfolio.
FnTunxd8tAM,Very nice tips...really appreciated
FnTunxd8tAM,"Hello Alex, you've been truly an inspiration to me.

Graduating straight from college, I took a BootCamp and made my skills stronger in the technical term. 

I do have a question regarding data analyst. Would you label it more in the i.t. field or financial field?

I'm currently interested in the i.t. field to transition more into data analyst, but I feel like being in accountant side of things help too."
FnTunxd8tAM,"Amazing video as always, Alex! unfortunately, I was scammed into providing my personal information a few days ago on LinkedIn so be careful you guys. I was too excited and quick to reply. I questioned their request after I submitted my personal info which was a little too late so TAKE YOUR TIME AND ANALYZE EVERYTHING before going out any personal info."
FnTunxd8tAM,Haven't finished my course yet but just browsing LinkedIn jobs and I've definitely seen all of these. Especially #2 and #5. I see #2 in every field unfortunately. #5 I've seen labeled as a junior level a couple times. It's frustrating. Flexible hours does sound tempting to me but being on call is not 😂
FnTunxd8tAM,Swear some people think we're like data accountants lol
FnTunxd8tAM,"I love this channels, I’m glad that I came across with your channel. Keep the good work."
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks Alex
FnTunxd8tAM,Please when will you conclude the Tableau series? Thanks
FnTunxd8tAM,"What is the difference between SQL SERVER, MySQL , PostdgeSQL and others?"
FnTunxd8tAM,"These tips are great! I'd add if anyone you interviewed with resigns from the company during the hiring process, you may want to decline any job offers. LOL!

This happened at least 3 times to me."
FnTunxd8tAM,"I have an idea as good as linked in but not the same. I Need a Data Analyst or scientist, app and web developer to help me to develop the idea. Since this is an idea I will share everything in equal parts. Who ever that is interested message me."
FnTunxd8tAM,Complete the tablu series plzzzzz
FnTunxd8tAM,Hi Alex your videos always have huge amount of information and special thanks for that 👍👏 As a Tableau learner if you make a video on some important terms in resume of tableau/ BI developer it will be really useful for us.
FnTunxd8tAM,I use the exact same mouse. Are you trying to copy my style? Next thing you know I might shave my head to copy yours
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks for this video and always sharing your experiences. Can you do a video on possible interview questions they may ask in a data analyst interview thanks
FnTunxd8tAM,If there is company values and you cant speak out - leave immediately
FnTunxd8tAM,They want a data scientist or data engineer but are saying they are looking for a Data Analyst.
FnTunxd8tAM,"Alex, I appreciate your mentorship on YouTube to those of us looking to break into data analytics.

However, I'm a Nigerian (Africa) where the unemployment rate is sky-high. Because of this, many companies list DA Job descriptions exactly like this. In fact, many give you age limits!! They tell you to have 3-5 yes experience as a Junior DA. They expect you to have a Post-grad degree in statistics, economics, business, CS et all making it hard to break into the DA field in my country. 

Currently. I just finished a DA bootcamp with a start-up and I'm about starting a 1 month internship with that start-up. 

I have my Bachelors and Masters degree in Pharmacology. Switched into DA too late (I'm almost 30). 

Really need your candid advice and encouragement because what works in your home country - USA may not work in Africa. We don't have the luxury of choice here. We take what jobs we can get even if the envt is toxic and the manager is Lucifer's elder bro. 

So, what are your thoughts? How can you tailor your videos to account for those in Africa?"
FnTunxd8tAM,You mentioned specific pitfalls for series A abs C but what about B? I just got a phone screening with one and would love some questions I can ask to see if it’s a good fit. Also awesome video thank you so much!
FnTunxd8tAM,The most common one is listing the JD of a data scientist and label it as a data analyst so that they can get cheaper DS
FnTunxd8tAM,Almost all of these are exactly like what I applied for as a junior web developer position haha...Currently switching my career so hopefully I've learned it now and you confirmed it!
FnTunxd8tAM,"One general one to look out for , ask within this position, who is the oldest member that is in that exact role. Chances are if it's less than 3-4 years it usually means either somehow people keep getting promoted out, it gets burned out or kicked off"
FnTunxd8tAM,"I agree with you 100%! Places looking for junior ""rockstars"" ultimately want you to do everything and don't want to teach you the skills you don't necessarily have (like Python).

I think it's important for people to check Glassdoor on interview reviews and job reviews. For example, is there a live coding session or is it a ""homework assignment""? (Where the company tries to steal your work).  My company has very bad reviews on their interview process (due to a homework assignment that can take 3+ hours) and then they wonder why applicants are dropping out of the process!"
FnTunxd8tAM,"100% correct from my experiences. I appreciate that you mention to still apply, just ask about it then make the call. 

I try to ask indirectly about work load. I use things like “what is the busy, all hands on deck times for this team?” - that method has served me well. 

“Alex, the (mentor) analyst”"
FnTunxd8tAM,Thank you!  Those insights were quite helpful!!
FnTunxd8tAM,"Woow .. Omg this is exaactly the job description of a start-up I joined a few months ago .. It was for a pre-hiring internship, I finished the internship and declined the offer"
FnTunxd8tAM,"Great video! Please, make more portfolio projects! :)"
FnTunxd8tAM,"This video is everything. Literally, everything you mentioned is exactly what I've been seeing. I can't get an opportunity tp save my life. I saw a job post that was for a Jr DA and wanted 3-8 years of experience with everything a Data Scientist does... I was puzzled. About 90% of the jobs I've seen want the world out of the DA."
FnTunxd8tAM,ALMOST ALL jobs postings in greece are like this.
FnTunxd8tAM,Can you make a video about the data analyst horror story if you haven’t already?
FnTunxd8tAM,Great video. Thank you
FnTunxd8tAM,"what are your thoughts on remote internships site by career up?
is it worth it  ?, I'm still a student."
FnTunxd8tAM,Any posting that mentions ninja or rockstar.
FnTunxd8tAM,"Great video Alex and thanks for posting it.  I was thinking about you the other day tho and since you came from a psych background……I wonder if you had it to do over again, would you have skipped your first job in the field if it meant waiting longer to become an analyst?   I ask bc I have an accounting degree and going for a career pivot as well."
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks Alex
FnTunxd8tAM,Thanks
FnTunxd8tAM,complete the Tableau Series PLZ
FnTunxd8tAM,"I’m about to enter my final semester this spring and begin applying for jobs, so I love these kind of videos and your project videos. Thanks for sharing your experience and knowledge!"
FnTunxd8tAM,"Alex a question, im in monitoring unit dept . I m not learning anything in my job . I all day monitor screen and alerts and report it to relevant dept. Is it good or should I move ? Idk I'm so confused."

Literally that’s been my life going through this google analytics course while working mandatory overtime since March 😭. Halfway through it though."
-_z_aphWSEo,"So much truth I so can relate. It seems the more I learn, the more often I google things."

pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex,

I’m interviewing for a Data Analyst position and they want me to complete an exercise where I need to analyze a large dataset in Excel (42 columns, 10 millions rows) using Python or SQL.  Then I have to present it. Do you have any suggestions/tips on the best way to do this?  

Thanks for any feedback you can provide!"
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex, how are you doing?
I have a question to ask. I have been googling it for a while now and the answers I find, is either too old to be applied to 2021 or not well defined. 
The question is; is Chrome Os good for data analysis?
There are a bunch of reasons why I prefer to buy a Chromebook to start my data analysis self teaching journey.
1. I am extremely broke and Chromebooks are a bit cheaper.
2. I kinda like the Linux way of doing things than the Windows'
3. I like the ecosystem between Android and Chrome Os
I don't know (to what extent) how the slight differences between Excel and Sheets might affect me. I would like to work with Sheets than with Excel.
Please let me know (at your leisure time) how safe or unsafe it is, buying and doing data science with a Chromebook. 
I have another question in the pipeline, but I feel like, adding it to this one makes things lengthy. So I'll come up with that next time. Thanks. 
And lo, if you have a video or any document somewhere,  answering my question, please link me. I think that will be much simpler for you"
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex, a lot of big, competitive, and low tech market cities in Europe, Australia, and Canada have incredibly low success rates and awful application-to-interview ratios for data jobs. Some cities are so competitive, they set the entry-level minimum requirements to a masters degree, and even then, too many masters holders in low-tech-job cities like Toronto are sitting unemployed and switching to similar dev/IT roles just to make a living. What do you recommend in those scenarios? Is it worth moving to the US?"
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Alteryx is an amazing tool and replaces the need to learn SQL, Python or Data Science related coding. The only problem is, you need a company that can afford the license fees to get you a seat"
pL0jEjeM5hI,"I love the content. I have to disagree with the education. I have 15+ years analytics experience in the military, built a portfolio but keep getting passed over for fresh college grads. 65+ job applications fromAug 8 through today.  one job went to a 23 year old who didn’t event know pivot tables in excel. 
From my view, to make it as self taught it is all about being at the right place at the right time. Good luck with that. For every Alex (who I do appreciate, nothing but appreciation from me) there are 2000 others that are not given that chance. Go get the education, certification and anything else to help you stand out. Keep trying, don’t quit - but stay realistic and get certifications."
pL0jEjeM5hI,I wonder how long it takes to get a job after taking a data analysist course at a bootscamp like Faltiron on average.
pL0jEjeM5hI,Lets assume i am total beginner in analytics. I have very poor knowledge of Microsoft Access.Should i learn it or i can start with Sql right away?Thank you for your answer in advance.
pL0jEjeM5hI,As a Marine vet who is coming from Aviation data admin and worked as an Army contractor to now working towards my data analysis degree this is helpful. Especially since right know college is a hard for me because I know from experience that while college is good OJT is the best teacher. As you mentioned I also try to do other projects to have a small profile to show
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hey Alex, can you recommend a python track alongside the google analytics cert. ?"
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex I just gotta say, this is a awesome video. Thank you. I say this because it gives me a sense of hope and inspiration that I too can become a data analyst. I'm currently in an online school right now taking a course in data analytics. I'm also  taking a course in SQL . I'm learning SQL on Microsoft SQL Server. I'm currently 5 months in on the data analytics course. I'm 2 months in learning SQL at another online school. I'm coming from working 30+ years in the United States Postal Service 📫 . I wanted to start a new career that involves me solving problems and no more heavy lifting Amazon packages 😄  Keep up the good work you're doing.  Peace"
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hey! I have been following you for a bit and I wanted your advice because I was actually interested in BI analytics but I am not sure which master or certification online I should apply to. I come from a total different background so I am kinda on the edge between the BI analyst or data analyst . Please help 😅
pL0jEjeM5hI,"I wanted to take this moment and truly appreciate how selfless you are, you have made my college life a lot easier. You are a life saver, THANK YOU so much!!!!!!!"
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Very helpful information right here, I didnt think much about he domain knowledge and now I know thats something very important to keep in mind, thank you very much Alex for your excellent content!!"
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thanks alex. Been loving your content as a whole. Very inspiring and very helpful at squashing imposter syndrome when it inevitably creeps up on a self taught analyst. I haven't been actively practicing my data tools and certainly needed this one. Thanks again =D
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hi Alex, just wanted to say I recently found your page and am loving all of the advice and examples.  Thanks for your hard work!"
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thanks for sharing this. Very encouraging and inspiring to see these people coming from non analytics background and became a data analyst!
pL0jEjeM5hI,How about power apps? Is there a need to learn it to grow as data analyst?
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Hey Alex, I'd like to show my thanks and appreciation quickly before I get down to work. Your channel has opened up a world of opportunity and potential to me. You make high quality videos, high quality in production but also content. You've drastically changed the way I think about data and the IT field whether through the topics you discuss, the tutorials that you teach, the references that you share, and so much more. I appreciate all the work and dedication you've done for us since the very beginning. I hope to give back in return by watching all of your videos and someday buying your merch. Sincerely, from an aspiring 18-year old data analyst."
pL0jEjeM5hI,Thank you Alex. This is more than an inspiration.
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Alex! Great timing: my last interview mentioned Alteryx as a skill I’d use on the job! Will definitely watch this tonight/tomorrow as I prep for interview #2!

Thank you for all your content, it has helped me tremendously as I transition into data analytics! Do you have any advice for those of us who are getting interviews, but haven’t yet gotten an offer? I’m still applying and studying, putting myself out there, but want to improve and get hired already. Is it just a patience game and keep staying as positive as possible?"
pL0jEjeM5hI,Love that you all did not study data analytics in college because I for sure would not want to rack up more debt by going back for a second degree in data analytics. I truly now believe it is about finding your resources and grinding. Thank you!
pL0jEjeM5hI,"In terms of Data Analytics I have over 5 yrs working w/Alteryx, 5 w/Tableau and 9 w/OBIEE BI literally 0 recruiters knocking on my door regarding these programs.  If you're like me and you don't have SQL experience then you're nothing to recruiters."
pL0jEjeM5hI,Hey I live in Allen TX too and also in the same field!!!
pL0jEjeM5hI,"While Domain Knowledge is very important it is something that can be learned, quicker & easier than the technical skills. 

So, if you’re hiring someone who has most of the technical skills but not the domain knowledge don’t count them out. Just cause someone has domain knowledge doesn’t always mean they’ll be the better analyst. 

At least that’s been my experience in Analytics. It might be easier for Analytics managers to think that way because it’s more convenient/self-serving for them but doesn’t mean it’s right. 

As a matter of fact, when you see an Analyst who’s worked in multiple industries and done well then you know they must be good at learning."
pL0jEjeM5hI,I appreciate that last question. I’m 44. I  explained to my wife that I can make a career change at my age. Currently learning python 🐍for data analytics on udemy and working on projects.  Thanks for the encouraging video.
pL0jEjeM5hI,"Thank you, Alex!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,That has been my biggest issue trying to pick a domain. Finance is my first idea or healthcare. I do a lot of reading but I'm leaning towards finance/fintech
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thanks a lot ALex
eg_5EAUXs5o,"I am transitioning to data science right now. I am not interested in any domain but I got one opening at a sports analytics firm in Berlin. But there are very few players in the market of sports analytics and only one in entire Germany. So that means, less room to switch jobs for salary hikes and chances of boss turning toxic due to  domain niche would be more. So I would target more generalist domains like banking or audit where tones of players are there in the market. More room for growth and I will have a parachute ready incase work place turns toxic."
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Thank you very much Alex for making a great and instructive video regarding a topic which often ignored in other data related channels. It was really beneficial.

Have a really quick question on this topic: As you know there are many data consultancy firms which offer services to a many clients from a wide range of topics. Do you think these firms are better place for a Jr. Analyst position as you could get experience with different domains? Then, perhaps after 2,3 years you could focus on the ones you like most."
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Ah, ok. By ""domain,"" you mean industry. Which industry or type of business you want to be an analyst in. I was thinking you were going to talk about technical domains and to specialize early in a combination of machine/platform/languages. Like, chose Windows or Mac, then choose Google of Microsoft, and then choose their preferred suite of tools. Get good in one combination before you branch out into something else. Does that make sense? Or should you just git gud at it all?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"As devils advocate, a mistake you can also make is choosing a domain too early. If you specialize too early in a young career, you can limit your opportunities down the road. I think there is a balance."
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hey Alex do you think it's still suitable if its done in reverse, like getting a degree in a domain (finance) then learning about data analytics?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thank you so much. You have really helped to things in perspective.  I look forward to you the complete video.
eg_5EAUXs5o,Alex if you could explain how data analysis works in health care system then it would be great.....
eg_5EAUXs5o,Happy New year  . How can I register for the mentorship program
eg_5EAUXs5o,So agree on this.  I decided early on to stay in the HR Domain/function and it is was a good choice
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thanks for the advice!
eg_5EAUXs5o,This is an awesome point Alex. Domain expertise is almost as important as tech expertise.
eg_5EAUXs5o,"I would be wary of throwing salary numbers without considering cost of living, size of company, reputation of company, etc. I'm an incoming Data Analyst at a large company making $100k, first time in the domain, with 1.5 of total YOE. Glad you're discussing these sorts of topics though, super interesting!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thanks a lot Alex for always ditching out good content and admonishing people on how to be successful in their career path.👍🏻
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hello Alex. I just found your channel, and I have been really enjoying it! I am making the switch in careers from a High School Math Teacher to Data Analyst (hopefully soonish), and your videos have really helped me acquire some much-needed insights to make the switch less confusing. Thanks for all you do!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Thanks for the great content. Since you moved to SC, what ever happened with your promotion here in DFW?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,I think that I might be more attracted to data than a specific domain. Although geospatial data seems to creep into many of my portfolo projects.
eg_5EAUXs5o,to much beard not enough mustache :(
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hey Alex, I really really wanted you to ask this question.
How the hell do you manage time????????
I recently got a job and I am really having trouble to manage my work-life balance in this pandemic. I don't know how you manage to work at a job and still are making such great youtube videos. Could you make a video about this. I am in no position to learn new things as I get all messed up with my job. If you are reading plzzzzz unmystify this secret of yours being so good at the things you do!!!!
I could really use your advice.
I work as a Jr. Business Analyst for a company and I want to switch to data analytics. But I've got not time to learn/study new things.
Please help!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"This are some good tips. For some places, finding Jobs in one particular domain might be very difficult."
eg_5EAUXs5o,Great content as usual Alex! Thank you for this kind of heads up. Also would like to share that thanks to the guides from your channel I was able to get a Data Analyst Job. Hope you keep making videos like this!
eg_5EAUXs5o,"I Found it difficult getting a job straight out of college. I Majored in Business data analytics this spring, 5 years of military experience, and countless data projects. The job outlook isnt as good as they say it is.. but im happy to be where i am now"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hi Alex,
I guess we need another video about top 5 domains (except  healthcare and consulting;) what do think about databricks?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Quick question bud. I am a Tech Support Engineer for a premium WordPress plugin. What should be my ideal direction? Watching your videos and subscribing to your channel made me want to be a Data Analyst or Data Engineer.
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Really looking forward for the next video, great video as always!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"can i have main analytics jobs like regular job or full time jobs but in startup or tech company like tokopedia (indonesian amazon), gojek (indonesian uber), the domain is depend what the project i hands on, but i also have freelance analytics for side hustle in particular domain like maybe sports like sport analytics for football or basketball or badminton (my country superior sport branch that win tokyo olympics 2020 gold medal for double woman, and championship of thomas cup 2020 recently) or tennis (my family sports environment) or esports like dota / valorant(you know lah wkwkwkwk)?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hi Alex
Thanks for your advice. 
Could you talk about DA in the supply chain (or logistics, and transportations), and service platforms during your next videos?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thank you again Alex!
eg_5EAUXs5o,"if you're not ready to pick a domain yet, but still want to make $$$ I highly recommend consulting! good vid :)"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hii Alex , I am a Dentist however i have lost the interest to practice clinical dentistry.  I wish to pursue Healthcare Informatics masters program. What do you think about this change? Do Healthcare Data Analyst make good money?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Hey Alex! So I'm currently an HVAC tech and I started looking into data analytics as a full time career. I am going to be enrolling in Google's data analyst course as well as doing a python course and 365 data science course on udemy. My two major questions are: what domains would you say are the best paying ones and what are some other areas or skills that would be good to study to put on a resume? I do have a couple years of coding (C and C++) experience from university but nothing else really skills related that would make me stand out on a resume from all the other Google course candidates.
eg_5EAUXs5o,is telecommunications a good domain?
eg_5EAUXs5o,Do you think 365 Data Science plus doing projects are enough to prepare for a job?
eg_5EAUXs5o,"thank you Alex ,people tend to ignore this although it is extremely important for them, I've been wondering:
1) in this context I've been thinking about Finance can you make a video on what should I learn in order to break into this domain does a Master in finance worth it ? or it would be better to learn by my own? 
2)I'm majoring in computer science(bachelor) in my last year and I'm seeking an internship/entry level job in data analytics during college I've been working on software projects only,lastly I switched my interests into data analytics so I only have a certification from google as a junior data analyst and two minor case studies (project stone in my certification) should I put my previous projects in my resume and start applying now? or work on other data projects and then put them instead of SW projects"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hey Alex, I have no experience as a Data Analyst and want to start studying for it.
Do you think taking the ""top 10 courses on Udemy"" would be enough materials to study for entry-level?
Also, thank you for all the helpful videos!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thank you so much for posting this wonderful video.
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hi Alex, Thanks a lot for making again an amazing video. What domain is good if I want to make a transition from teaching to Data Analyst? I check your mentorship program, but it's sold out. How can I join the waitlist of the mentorship program? I really want to join that as I have full trust in your mentorship. Thanks"
eg_5EAUXs5o,You're a godsend. Thank you for making these extremely informative videos.
eg_5EAUXs5o,The next month is too long but I understand😁. I think age is an important factor to consider on this topic- if you're younger you can explore domains but an older individual with more responsibilities will have to put more consideration in selecting a domain especially if they are just entering the field.
eg_5EAUXs5o,"I'm just starting out with my career switch to data analysis. I'm teaching myself the big-picture of what DA is and then I will dive into courses.

I'm really interested in renewable energy; I like to keep track of it in my free time. It is also a growing field. I hope when I'm done studying, I can find something in that domain."
eg_5EAUXs5o,"To Alex and people in the comments section, what domain can a Data Analyst or a Data Scientist be in that has to do with Psychology?"
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Thank you Alex. I hope you can dive deeper into this topic by giving us a tour of the different domains. We appreciate your work, thank you."
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Alex u still look good even without glasses, background and all..... you legend....."
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Hello Alex, just wanted to inquire how to enroll for your mentorship program. Thanks!!!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,Thanks Alex! This video is super useful. I have finance background but I am interested in data analyst. I am still thinking of the right path to pursue cuz as you said I should figure out my domain. I cannot wait for your next videos about this field. How can you find out your domain during working as a data analyst? And where can I find your mentor program?
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Graduated in spring with a Business degree and no internships so it's been difficult getting my foot in the field. Followed your advice and did some projects, created a portfolio, and updated my resume with that and I've been getting more interviews these past few weeks. Thank you so much Alex."
eg_5EAUXs5o,@Alex the analyst where is the link to your mentorship program ?
eg_5EAUXs5o,"Good Morning Alex,
I am a senior in college studying Consumer Insights & Data Analytics and MIS. I am finishing up my internship this week and seeking a full-time position for 2022 at the moment, however I am unsure which websites to use to do so. Also, is retail a domain with a high salary cap? Thanks!"
eg_5EAUXs5o,i thought this was gonna be a vid on hoarding website domains to make money lol
eg_5EAUXs5o,This guy makes me want to become a data analyst.
eg_5EAUXs5o,I’m going to be graduating in the spring and I’m so happy I recently found your channel to start working on portfolio projects and setting myself up for success as a data analyst. Thank you!
eg_5EAUXs5o,Awesome Alex... thanks for all the hardwork you are doing for us🎉
eg_5EAUXs5o,First like from your num 1 fan 🥇 😂❤️👍
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 30 / 84"
ebjDwX8sUMk,done 30/84
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 30 / 84"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Seems like the Data has been changed since the release of this video. Unfortunately they dont show the same for me in tableau :(
ebjDwX8sUMk,"youre so near to the million play button, advance congratulations"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hey Alex, amazing content! just a quick question, @3:25, did you miss synchronizing the axis?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi everyone ,am I the only one who is having a problem with my tables not showing like Alex's for Directory data source?

Mine doesn't show options like country, postal code etc. under Tables and I cant practice along ,someone please kindly help."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I downloaded data from kaggle, but it is different, not as in the video."
ebjDwX8sUMk,Looks like you are also learning Tableau. Even you don't have any idea what you're doing 😂
ebjDwX8sUMk,When importing data csv file isn't read properly. Get into the data source tab and click the arrow sign next to the directory.csv text that appears middle of the page. Then select text field properties and choose comma instead of other on field separator. This will solve your problem.
ebjDwX8sUMk,"hi everyone, i have a dumb question though. How do i zoom in, zoom out the chart that he does at 12:49 ? Please help me , thank you everybody"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hello, has anybody experienced that the states/provinces aren't filled but just show dots? I'm trying to resolve the issue but haven't found how to do so."
ebjDwX8sUMk,thank you
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I am not able to change the colours, you showed in first part. I choose a color and than assign palette than again the color than apply than ok. but it is not changing the color."
ebjDwX8sUMk,Busted up laughing with the pie chart sizing fiasco cause I was going through the same😄
ebjDwX8sUMk,Data visualization depends on personal logic and creativity. Like there is no actual preference for these.
ebjDwX8sUMk,How come NA sales is more then global ? I mean global always more then a particular region. 4.56
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I am loving these videos!! I am currently taking a Data Analytics certification program course through Google and I am having a lot of fun so far, while I learn the key terms and skill traits of a Data Analyst i've been learning these videos as well and Alex does a great job explaining in a simple and welcoming manner, Thanks Alex! :)"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Fun to watch and intuitive! Thank you Alex.
ebjDwX8sUMk,Alex's instruction is so clear and easy to follow!
ebjDwX8sUMk,"the data that I download is not complete, it has only 3 columns? can any body tell me what is wrong?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"watching this from Palestine, my man right here saying ""Exciting news, in 2 days, 7th of October"""
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi Alex, thank you for the effort to deliver this amazing series. i have a question is it possible to use tableau for qualitative data?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Loving the content :) Thank you very much!!

Small tip or at least a favour: Add the tutorial/part number to the title as well ahahahhaa"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Pls ser...how can I get the data that's being used...I tried the two link dropped buh still it disentangle look like what you downloaded ser
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hey Alex, Thanks for the videos. I had just 3 columns in Tableau for Directory database, then I realized that the delimiter in Directory is (,) and when I changed it  to (#), everything worked perfectly. I thought I'd share this in case others run into a similar problem and need a clue to resolve it."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I'm SUPER grateful that you always include how to download the various files and datasets in your videos. This process often seems easy and straightforward, but I've had many times where downloading specific software or files has proved to be a real headache. As always, THANK YOU ALEX!"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Just started watching the Tableau playlist and I've got to say, I love the way you deliver these tutorials. Very different from a lot of professional courses and you just seem like a really cool person having fun with the data and teaching us at the same time. Thank you for doing what you do."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Dear Alex, In this lession, i'm not sure why doesn't show any blue circle point in map after i drag the ""Postcode"" into Marks, can you help? Thanks."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hello Mr alex, The data set pasted here isn’t the same thing as the one you are using to teach.
Tried to download it but it doesn’t seem to be the same data set"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"drag vertical and horizontal to make more space to adding size for pie chart is so frustrated, It only show very thin unvisionable line and have to put the mouse exactly on it to drag, how they design the way zoom like that"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Was the Webinar recorded and where can we find it?
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Dear Alex, Abu Dhabi is not in the United States. Did you make a mistake?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I'm a new subscriber.  Just completed the Google Data Analytics Program.
I'm experimenting with Tableau with some datasets.
One thing I'm finding confusing is where we can place the tables to populate are visuals.  For example,
I can't always just randomly drag a table into the Column or Row field, or the Marks or Filters area? What are the guidelines for this?  Thanks."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"At around the 4:19 mark it kind of looks like NA Sales is higher than Global Sales (left side / 1980s), which shouldn't be possible. Any idea why North America is making more sales than the whole world?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi @alex the Analyst, i don't understand something, i dont have the same display or the directory.cvs file, it semmes aggregated in mine ( i downloaded it on the same website)...so  i wasnt able to follow the same steps. i wasnt able to add postal code,etc. it seems agregated to a lot of filed, like Province,Country,etc"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"what did u do to fix the pie chart size
edit: ctrl shift B"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"starbucks data is not being uploaded to tableau properly - I'm getting raw 1 column data, and split doesn't work well for all rows due to comma inside ""..."" making extra columns for some rows . any suggestions?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Can you please do a video with Days of the week.. For example if we load daily data to create visuals on the sales per day of the week.  If you already have a video can you please send me the link.  Thank you.  Great content
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thanks
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thank you for being such a wonderful teacher
ebjDwX8sUMk,Kamala Harris enters the chat:” Im a fan of pie charts 🤣😂 Raise you hand if you like pie charts!”😂😂🤣😂
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Theres an issue, that i have to look up how to fix now. From the last video we created a BIN… thats now auto formatting the new data in worksheet 3."
ebjDwX8sUMk,Done
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi, Did anyone have a completely different dataset for Starbucks data? The data set I downloaded was for global + it was so messy, after importing it I had just 3 columns which I tried to split and then I ended up with an even bigger mess with values in the wrong columns... Did anyone else have this issue?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Came to this video because I heard there was a large pie and I like pie 😂😂 jokes aside, amazing content and walk-through. I've been re-learning Tableau and this video series has been amazing!"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Excellent videos Alex, i'm learning a ton"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hello Alex, I downloaded the dataset starbucks but there are only 3 columns when I import the file. The field columns like province, counrty,postcode, phone number are on the same column. What I do wrong?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thank you Mann
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi Alex, I cannot connect my SQL server to the data source in my Tableau public. It's not even showing the option of SSMS in the list of servers. Would you happen to know if I have any solution for that problem??"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hello Alex, I really enjoy all your video tutorials. I always try to follow along but I always run into some issues. I downloaded the data set from Keggle by clicking on the link in the description but I get maybe an update data set from when you made this video. I guess because it was a year ago. I will do my best to do as much as possible with the dataset I have. Thanks again."
ebjDwX8sUMk,Uhm.. nothing happens when I add the postcode or State/Province to the Marks.
ebjDwX8sUMk,"When I found out I can make big dough and work-from-home, just fuckin' around with some charts and spreadsheets, I damn near busted a nut. This series rocks, Alex the Analyst!"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I ran into a problem on the latitude and longitude where nothing was displayed on the map. But after going through the comments, I decided that the solution to this --> after dragging postcode on the Marks field, right click on the map > Edit Locations...> change the Country/Region to United States. Hope this helps for those who encounter the same problem :)"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"one question, dont you have to clean the csv file before uploading it?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi Alex. I only managed to display the map. The rest of the vide starting from the Postcode did not work with me. Nothing is displayed on the map. And, I did noticed that it displays >19K unknown on my screen, while on the video, your screen displays 285 unknown. I did use the provided link to download data. Please, help!"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Thank you very much, it's very helpful, please how can I save tableau sheet into my PC??...
I didn't find save and save as"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hi I had done the postcode part twice and its giving very few points on the map in United Kingdom, 
please do you know why it's so?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hello Alex, First of all, I love your content. Simple and effective. 
I need some help with this one. I gett error when I move from one sheet to the other when a new data is involved. For instance, if I move from directory data to vgsales, the analytics done in vgsales disappears and error msg - ""worksheet unavailable, There was a problem connecting to vgdataset source, this dataset doesn't currently support editing""
I also get this when i move from vgsales to directory. What do i do to fix this?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Loving this tutorial thank you very much. I also now just realized that was a microphone in front of you. I thought it was a glass of red wine!!
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Thank you a lot Alex for this video.  I have a different position of postcode for my latitude and longitude cart. In my case, the postcode is located in Europe(Belgium). Could you explain to me why, please?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thank you!
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hey Alex,  thanks as always for all your tutorials and mentoring.  On your suggestion i picked up the  Python for  Data Analysis book from O'Reilly, (when you still listed book resources in your descriptions) but i never saw one for Tableu (or don't remember ot if i did). Now, i happened across what I think is an excellent reference in book form, and wondered if you could check it out and consider it as a possible addition to your recommended reading : ""Tableau Strategies: Solving Real, Practical  Problems With Data Analytics"" by Ann Jackson and Luke Stanke (O'Reilly, 2021)"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"+1 For using Brave
-1 For no having the Cortana Search Bar disabled"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thank you for always taking your time with these videos
ebjDwX8sUMk,I have learnt so much from your tutorials. Thank you so much
ebjDwX8sUMk,Last viz was great👍
ebjDwX8sUMk,Pie chart in this case is bad choice
ebjDwX8sUMk,"If I am given the start and end lat and long coord. from a tornado data set from Storm Prediction Center data archives and want to plot those data on the map, caould I do that in tableau? Can I also plot information on when the tornado crosses state and/or county lines?"
ebjDwX8sUMk,where can i get country data file?
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hey Alex! Loving the course so far.
Ran into a problem, after adding the longitude and latitude.
I tried adding the postal code to ""marks"" but no data is showing, not dots or anything.
I tried adding countries and it worked just fine.
Is this a problem in the settings that I need to fix?
If anyone can help it would be highly appreciated."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I'm having problems at  5:38, when I load drag and drop ""Postcode"" only about 4 dots appear and they all are allocated in the UK. Anyone know how to solve this problem? - it seems like Tableau is not recognizing some of the post-code data"
ebjDwX8sUMk,I get Visualization only for India  and not for any other country any faced the same issue and know the way out ?
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thank you
ebjDwX8sUMk,Waiting for 4th and 5th part of the series...
ebjDwX8sUMk,"To be honest, Tableau seems to be very limited compared to Power BI."
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thanks
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Thanks Alex I'm wating for the part 4 & 5, you are awesome man you are changing my life 😀"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Great video series. Thanks !
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Hey Alex! Thanks for the wonderful content

I just decided to jump on learning data analytics and I really have no idea in what order to learn or where exactly scratch (basics ) is ...I'd appreciate if could help with what that"
ebjDwX8sUMk,Can you make a video of the data analysis  career when it will die  because of ai
ebjDwX8sUMk,Tried out other charts too. Must say it is both intriguing and interesting how we can play around and get to know different kinds of charts and where and how to use them. Looking forward for more on Tableau.
ebjDwX8sUMk,Alex does the google data analytics certificate will help us to get a job
ebjDwX8sUMk,"I'm switching my career from Electrical engineer to become a Date Analyst, your videos are very insightful and educational. Thank you!"
ebjDwX8sUMk,I have a question. I'm in the market for a new Laptop and i was wondering if Microsoft has a version of SSRS/SSIS/SSAS for Mac. I know you can get SSMS for Mac but what about those three....Cos those three are important for my Data Reporting learning path
ebjDwX8sUMk,Thank you sir for these great tutorials!!
ebjDwX8sUMk,All your videos are full of clarity and are well made.
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Thank you so much, Alex!"
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Alex great video as always love this series. Filling a huge gap in the Tableau community. I have one bit of critical feedback which is the way you’re using show me to get some final results. It’s generally okay especially for beginners but the issue with it is it obfuscates why the charts work the way they do. For example on your pie chart to box and whisker plot click, it changed the chart but there’s probably about 8 to 10 steps it did for you including adding what tableau considers a reference line and if you don’t clock those steps it’s actually a huge blocker for so many people when they go to build this charts later down the line. As a trainer I see a lot of approaches that people have where they build a chart then use show me but then get stuck on the final mile. I have a video just highlighting this issue here https://youtu.be/nal52Cdnm0o but again this is meant as friendly feedback and I’m being 110% pedantic about this."
ebjDwX8sUMk,"Been waiting for this video and it finally came on my birthday🕺🕺🕺
Thank you, Sir."
ebjDwX8sUMk,I learn english and Tableau with your video. Thanks!

f6qxxtWkaUg,"Thanks for sharing Free Data Analyst Bootcamp, having zero knowledge or background , but challenged myself to upgrade skills. Done 29 / 84"
f6qxxtWkaUg,Alex thanks so much for amazing tutorial tableau . 🙏🙏
f6qxxtWkaUg,thanks king
f6qxxtWkaUg,Is MACHINE LEARNING REQUIRED FOR DATA ANALYST
f6qxxtWkaUg,How many months approximately should I need to practice before starting to apply for jobs?
f6qxxtWkaUg,Well explained thanks 😊
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hello Alex, where’s the link for the 45 minutes series video you mentioned in the previous video?"
f6qxxtWkaUg,thnk you
f6qxxtWkaUg,how to find Customer Retention & Acquisition rate or number for specific time period?
f6qxxtWkaUg,👍
f6qxxtWkaUg,So easy to understand. Thank you Alex.
f6qxxtWkaUg,"I have 3 years experience of working as a data analyst at a large retail company with python, sql,  power bi and gcp Still recruiters discard me for entry level data analyst roles since I have no ""work experience"" of Tableau. I guess they dont understand what transferable skills are....."
f6qxxtWkaUg,Thank you sir for this😢... I just enroll in this course. And I am already learning a lot from you.
f6qxxtWkaUg,Wanted to enjoy it but that exclamation point in the bins title was too spicy.  Got indigestion.
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hello,

When I put the Global Sales in the Rows it doesn't give me the SUM. Anyone knows why? Thanks"
f6qxxtWkaUg,i dont see the option to create bins when i right click on the measure
f6qxxtWkaUg,"i had a question, what does 5 indiciate"
f6qxxtWkaUg,why is my y axis (% of total global sales having 5% interval instead of 2%
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hello, i have one question. If you filter for ""Shooter"" how is it possible that only this column is shown? And the other disappear. in Other words, i dont want to have a sum of all genres. Thanks for your help"
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Really enjoyed the Calculated Fields portion of this video. Very helpful! As always, THANK YOU ALEX for everything you do!"
f6qxxtWkaUg,How do you create a bin on a date field? I have water quality data and each collection point has a date and a value. I want to bin the median of the values by decade. I can't create a bin on a date though. Thanks!
f6qxxtWkaUg,Is Tableau Public free for use?
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hi Alex, great content and delivery for me, thanks. Would the differences not be even more visually striking for the dual bar chart comparison at the end to have same scale? How would you do that?"
f6qxxtWkaUg,"I am learning Tableau and these videos are very helpful.  I know there are many videos out there but your speed is great and easer to follow. 
One question, take the final bar graph you showed as an example, if you want to show the percentage within each bin (instead of % of total), how do you do it?  TIA
Also, I can't find quick table calculation in my newly downloaded Tableau Public. I wonder if they have made a change..."
f6qxxtWkaUg,4.14 I am facing a problem with using ctrl and dragging SUM(Global Sale) to the table? I cannot see the calculation? Anybody has this problem?
f6qxxtWkaUg,sir....is this series enough for tableau ??
f6qxxtWkaUg,Awesome!
f6qxxtWkaUg,Thank you for your information. At least I have learnt something new today.
f6qxxtWkaUg,"WOW JUST WOW!!!! I just want to say thank you for taking the time out to create such awesome content, I'm learning so much in mere days, thank you for all that you do!"
f6qxxtWkaUg,I am actually amazed at how flexible Tableau is. Thanks for the series.
f6qxxtWkaUg,Aaaaaaaamazing!!!
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Using the same file, my data starts on 1980. But the weird part is that my bins are grouping the amounts per category & totals in a very different way.
You're getting largest amount of sales for 2000-04, for example. I'm getting for 2005-09. Any idea why that might be Alex? Or anyone?"
f6qxxtWkaUg,Done
f6qxxtWkaUg,5:09 what is EU Sales
f6qxxtWkaUg,"""I'm gonna give it an exclamation point to really spice things up here.""

Who says data analysts don't know how to have fun"
f6qxxtWkaUg,very helpful! thank you!!
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Am not able to see the bin tag on dates 
It only shows on numerical data"
f6qxxtWkaUg,Does anyone know why his bins start from 1990 even though the range is from 1980-2020? Mines start from 1980
f6qxxtWkaUg,"your introduction to Tableau is very nice Alex! I am currently doing the coursera google cert for data analytics right now, and had to a mini project using Tableau (which was really bothersome for me as the intructor didn't even mention where she got her dataset from ie what was the title of the set). I am learning a lot more through you videos on Tableau. I have already learned that in the excel sheet the attributes in the sheet become the list at the left hand side when you are making your graphs and charts (through my own experimentation ie making up a dataset using 5-6 attributes)...I like your video as it is more subdued and calm..."
f6qxxtWkaUg,I feel having worked with a similar software during my summer internship is really helping me to pick this back up really fast. Thank you Alex for making concise videos!
f6qxxtWkaUg,"88F at 10PM, man it stays warm where you are all night."
f6qxxtWkaUg,I love how you chunk the glasses and how you teach. Thank you for the lessons
f6qxxtWkaUg,Thank you!
f6qxxtWkaUg,How do you make sure that data is consistent across multiple reports?
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Thank you, Alex!!!"
f6qxxtWkaUg,you make looks like really easy!! where can i learn about dashboard and questions ideas?
f6qxxtWkaUg,thank you for making this video
f6qxxtWkaUg,"alex, Please make in depth video on calculated field . Please."
f6qxxtWkaUg,Alex what is sub charts in tableau ? Please tell me. And how to create ?
f6qxxtWkaUg,"In case anyone was playing around after the first tutorial and forgot how we left off,  we had a filter on Platforms: PS, PS2, PS3, PS4. Also, my vertical axis wasn't refreshing so I double clicked the Global Sales vertical axis and changed the Range to update Automatic. This is a great introduction to Tableau, Alex. I had been using Excel to review and analyze accounting data for years, and could never get the graphs to do what I wanted."
f6qxxtWkaUg,"This seems a lot interesting. Initially I thought it was going to be difficult understanding how to go about Tableau features, but I am sure your videos are helping me a lot not just with visualisations but with Data Analytics as a whole. I have a small personal project with  basic data which I will try on Tableau to get a better understanding. Thank you Alex for the video."
f6qxxtWkaUg,Another great video Alex!!! But please release leet code hard sql questions Video.
f6qxxtWkaUg,why do you prefer tableau than google studio?
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hey Alex , Presently I am pursuing my graduation 2nd year.U really inspired me .
Iam in a road to become a successful data Analyst in India. Really I learned many good skills from u.And Still Iam going on.Keep up the good work buddy."
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hello Alex...I'm a big fan of your channel. Your content was absolutelly amazing. I was wondering I f I could ask you a question , I finished my masters and now I am looking on a job role for data analyst. Can you guide me and show the road map on the skills required for data analyst. I've got 100's of friends which are in this same situation. Don't know where to start really !!"
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Just popping in to say that your videos helped me immensely in creating a path toward gaining the skills that would eventually land me my first job in data analytics. Your series on building a portfolio was probably the most helpful in helping me understand how to transition into this new career. After 7 months of online studies (including learning from your videos!), and nearly 100 job applications later, I was finally offered a job as a marketing analyst. I've been at this role a little over a month, and I still can't believe I get paid to do something so fun. It feels like I'm just solving puzzles all day! I signed up for an Alteryx training the other day, and I was pleasantly surprised and stoked to see you as one of the speakers. Your videos helped me land this job, and now I get to watch your trainings as a part of my job! Thank you for all you're doing for us newbies to the field!"
f6qxxtWkaUg,What would perfer mac os or windows for data analytics???
f6qxxtWkaUg,Why we create bins ? What is the benefits/ use of creating bins ? Please say Alex. Thank you
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hello Alex ,, I’m one of your fan from Saudi Arabia

f6qxxtWkaUg,Thank you Alex!
f6qxxtWkaUg,"I saw this video from this YouTuber about data analyst pathway, i wanted to hear ur input on a video or comment section ———>>>>>>. https://youtu.be/_eAl7vuVu3U"
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hey Alex, you'd referred to a Tableau course that was essentially just projects. Could you please mention where i could find that course?"
f6qxxtWkaUg,I literally used that data set for class project about a year ago 😄
f6qxxtWkaUg,"Hey alex

6xv1KvCMF1Q,so nice video to get undertsanding basic logic of Tableau. Thanks sooooo much
6xv1KvCMF1Q,If you are dividing them into five videos then atleast provide their link rather then chit chat for no value and give some thoughts before making the video. Worst video ever
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"Thank you so much, you made it a lot more easier to understand."
6xv1KvCMF1Q,I didn't know the Eric ten Hag was a business analyst.
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"Thank you, Alex!
I am very new to this data world thing, and 've been lurking for two days on these streets to find something i can follow, but i was discouraged when i came across someone with ""30 HOURS"" in one video :( 
Thank you for making this doeable!"

6xv1KvCMF1Q,Thank you for the video. Really grateful!

6xv1KvCMF1Q,Why is the weather quality changing so quickly during the course of this video? So strange. Maybe strong winds in an industrial zone?🤔

6xv1KvCMF1Q,"Thank you Alex for this beautiful introduction into how to use tableau for Data Visualization, I started using Tableau for Data Analysis, yet I don't find it that difficult but the only thing important is to understand all the features and their uses in tableau to make it easier when applying."
6xv1KvCMF1Q,i am not able to do max count by genre in label
6xv1KvCMF1Q,Appreciate your sharing things. But I found a mistake that Action is not peaking at every year. Min/Max does the operation of Alphabetical Min/Max of Genre. Hope you got it. Refer: 10:22
6xv1KvCMF1Q,Alex! Thanks for your fantastic video.

6xv1KvCMF1Q,"I love what you are doing 
But I have a problem 
I can't download tableau public 😢😢"
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"That pop-up window that allows you to adjust min/max and labels does not show up for me when I select ""labels"" Am I doing something wrong? I am very new to this. Is there a different way now since I am on a newer version since this uploaded?"

6xv1KvCMF1Q,"Thanks Alex!!!  I am trying to learn this Tableau thing, I found another group of videos and they were always like doing something, then changing their minds, then changing it again... like if they were learning by themselves, recording it, and posting it as if it was a course hahaha!
But your video,.,,, uh lalá! I really got it.... hope the following videos are just this amazing and not forcing us to purchase something else.

6xv1KvCMF1Q,"28/74
Lets go!!!"
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"Hi Alex, I notice that in my Tableau, it reads the data as a String and not as a number (I talk about the Sales one), Am I doing something wrong with download or it's a common error? Plus if I try to modify that he says me ""NULL"", so I think that he see 20.3 as a string and not a number"
6xv1KvCMF1Q,how to find Customer Retention & Acquisition rate or number for specific time period?
6xv1KvCMF1Q,I cannot download it😢
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"thank you for the video. It kinda sucks that we need to create a Kaggle account to download the data. Also, when I imported the file, all the columns were interpreted as text"
6xv1KvCMF1Q,Alex- this was a BIG help. Thank you for helping me understanding some of the basics of Tableau.
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"short  , simple , organized , thanks Mr. Alex"
6xv1KvCMF1Q,"I know that I am 2 years late to the show but if someone is reading the comments, 
Please tell what I am doing wrong. 
I get completely different values than Alex. I have noticed that after opening the file, I don't have Sums of sales, I have something called CNTD count distinct so it gives me wrong results. 
Can someone ease tell me how to change that. Thanks."
6xv1KvCMF1Q,thankyou sir

465x3JmMJYU,I will definitely remember this video way better than I remember the portfolios😂
465x3JmMJYU,😂 this was nice man!
465x3JmMJYU,Jesus! The shirt is everything and more!
465x3JmMJYU,"Ahaha, that is amazing, Alex. I love the jamba juice and the shepherd dog parts, lol. How can you connect them together in the interview? Hilarious!!! :))"
465x3JmMJYU,"Lol, Funny.
I have a question though.
So do I need to understand statistics to be a good data analyst?
In your experience as a junior data analyst did you really work with statistical programming?"
465x3JmMJYU,They have great juice 🤣🤣🤣
465x3JmMJYU,This is hilarious. Alex  interviews Alex freebird... LMAO 🤣
465x3JmMJYU,"Stooop, Alex Freebird is so fun man!!!!"
465x3JmMJYU,He is overqualified lol great video
465x3JmMJYU,Epic!! 😂🤣😂
465x3JmMJYU,"""I don't think I'm getting hired because I'm TOO GOOD of a candidate"" - Alex Freebird"
465x3JmMJYU,How did you land the interview when those ATS won't even accept Jesus's resume? 🤣Just be careful that PWC doesn't see this video 😅
465x3JmMJYU,Should everything in this be taken as contraindicated?
465x3JmMJYU,"""I tried it once, but it was super confusing."" 😂😂 Laughed nonstop through this."
465x3JmMJYU,"Alex Freebird, the free-spirit, interviewed by Alex, the (psycho)analyst.  You should send this video to anyone scheduled to interview with you now that you are a manager.  ;-)"
465x3JmMJYU,"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great laughs for my day. THANK YOU for the needed comic relief. Hey buddy .... if this analyst thing doesn't workout, let me manage your new career as a comedian. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
465x3JmMJYU,Does this qualify us to get free Jamba Juice for a lifetime? I mean “they got good juice”!
465x3JmMJYU,"To be honest Alex, I don't think anyone would answer interview questions this way unless he purposely wants to loose the opportunity.

Otherwise, funny content Alex."
465x3JmMJYU,Great piece! Kept me smiling throughout.
465x3JmMJYU,"Hahahhahahaha....this was super entertaining as well as knowledgeable .You definitely covered many points of "" don't s "" in the interview with humor....

I was just going through interviews related content and this was really refreshing 😂

Thank you so much again. Huge fan of yours. You have been literally my guide for last few months ( learning data analytics with architecture background )
Really appreciate your work !!"
465x3JmMJYU,"Hey now, don't come for Alex Freebird's love of Excel. 😂 This cracked me up because this could've been almost any interview nowadays. Folks really add keywords just to get the interview. Great job, Alex (Freebird not The Analyst)! 😝"
465x3JmMJYU,Your funny dude! Absolutely loved that ending. The deadlines response had me cracking up.
465x3JmMJYU,It's the Data Mining for me 😄. I must say Alex Freebird has A LOT of confidence!
465x3JmMJYU,"funny! please invite Freebird again to show us how not to behave in the corporate environment,"
465x3JmMJYU,Hi Alex. Nice skit. Keep them coming. Is that a Casio square g-shock with bullbars?
465x3JmMJYU,"All I'm here to say is....






grape juice"
465x3JmMJYU,"So this may be a dumb question, but for informational interviews specifically is it still bad to ask for feedback on why they think you’re not getting call backs?"
465x3JmMJYU,Haha you should see the guy who does jobs interview for YouTube content
465x3JmMJYU,"Now, this is absolutely hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 Whaaaaat!"
465x3JmMJYU,Too soon
465x3JmMJYU,"This was very funny Alex 😂, pretty good for a first attempt 😛"
465x3JmMJYU,Sir can I get you email please need some suggestions
465x3JmMJYU,I thought that u r going to say not to become data analyst 😂
465x3JmMJYU,"Oh, no, is drinking during an interview really that bad?! 

Ok, loved that portfolio comment - I had a friend who asked my mom for business advice once but wanted her to sign a non-disclosure before he explained what he was trying to do.  Mmm no."
465x3JmMJYU,2:38  Heard a coworker say this before and almost lost it.  I do think plugging Gam-Gam is a solid move tho lmao
465x3JmMJYU,"To be fair, that is a pretty sweet fish shirt"
465x3JmMJYU,Asking of adding tiktok was legit!🤣
465x3JmMJYU,Nice 👌👌
465x3JmMJYU,"If you asked me in April of this year what a Data Analyst does, I really would have had no idea what the job involved. After watching your videos, starting the Google Data Analytics Course I am now running SQL queries on all kinds of random things. Did you know for instance that the largest county was in Alaska or that there were 79 counties where water covers a greater area than land - the largest of which is Keweenaw County in Missouri? (I think). Anyway, thanks Alex, I'm really enjoying Data Analytics so far. Who, knows, might even try and get a job in the field next year from randomly stumbling across your video. I love YouTube."
465x3JmMJYU,Seems a bit counterintuitive don't you think? 🤔
465x3JmMJYU,This was the best thing ever lol
465x3JmMJYU,😜🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😁 Data mining = I don't know 😜🤭
465x3JmMJYU,😂😂😂
465x3JmMJYU,Hahahahha just finished my Google data analystics course on your recommendation. Gonna apply for jobs with the confidence of Alex freebird😂
465x3JmMJYU,Alex should go easy on Alex
465x3JmMJYU,"Hahaha, that shirt reminds me of an English teacher that had a new goofy tie for every day of the year…."
465x3JmMJYU,Alex Freebird or Alex Freefish 💀
465x3JmMJYU,Real funny.
465x3JmMJYU,"Hahaa that was hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣 You've got an amazing sense of humor, Alex! Looking forward to more of these! 😈"
465x3JmMJYU,😂😂😂😂😂😂
465x3JmMJYU,Alex freebird got all the things right for not being selected as a data analyst 😅
465x3JmMJYU,🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
465x3JmMJYU,🤣😅🤣
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Y’all are the real MVPs 🙌
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,“I AM the team” hahaha

Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Congrats Alex! Leave the plaque behind you in videos, I think it looks cool and it shows off how legit you are haha"
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Congrats ,where and how did you applied for your 1st data analysts job."
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Tableau tutorial from you will be a breakthrough for me. Please we wait.
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Congrats, Alex. I forever appreciate your works. Learning from you always and I believe in your words in becoming the Data Analyst I dream of. Thanks a big deal."
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Hi Alex.. Big congratulation.. 
Could you please help me to creat a gauge chart in tableau which shows the target sales"
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Hey Alex, can you tell about  financial analyst in your next video? Please."
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Congratulations! Well deserved.. quick question about the portfolio website.. About 4 days after building my portfolio website through your video, I had a new project I wanted to add, I added it, it showed through the live server but it didn't reflect on my website. I had to delete the portfolio repository on goy up and add again.. Do I always need to delete the old repository on gitup and create a new one for my new added project to reflect?"
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"I really think you are awesome. You made the decision to change careers, which most won't dare. You produce awesome content and you are clearly a great data analyst. Thank you for sharing your journey with us. It's not just the hard skills you teach but the motivation you give out by showing what you did. Thank you a lot, keep it up"
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Wow congratulations 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Hey Alex, I'm a data scientist at Google. I'd be interested in hopping onto your show as a guest speaker and talk about my experience as a data scientist at Google."
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Congratulations Alex!
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Congrats! You deserve it!
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Hi Alex, I want to say thank you for posting all these great videos, you motivated me to make the decision to switch career, and helped me to achieve this goal in so many ways. I just got a data analyst offer today with an amazing package, this is my dream come true. You are the best Alex! I will continue to watch your videos and I will support this channel forever."
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Congrats Alex!
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"Thank you for all your videos Alex, im currently comparing 2 different jobs to choose from, very different salary offers. But I was hoping to talk to you for 5 minutes to help me make that decision. Probably a long shot, but i figured its worth trying as im thinking about taking a 8,000 paycut to get into the field but im not sure if this job of ""Data Quality intermediate analyst"" really is the correct path to Business analysis. or would i be making less money and not really benefiting my career much. Would greatly appreciate a few minutes of your time"
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,I'm currently a senior in hs and I'm wondering if data analyst would fit me. Can I ask what degree do you need to get to become a data analyst? How long is it gonna take? and what is the starting salary? Thank you! And would you mind if I reach out to you to ask some specific questions about this career?
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,Congrats! 😉
Ns1ZpTxQnUE,"deym alex, you did pretty well. glad to see this"

HiOtQMcI5wg,"The real talk is nice. “It took ten hours over two weeks”. These are things people need to hear. Some people watch these videos on YT and think it is just that easy. This is why your channel is on my short list of channels I subscribed to. Thanks for all your time on these. 

Hey MS Excel - sponsor this channel!"
HiOtQMcI5wg,"This didn't work for me as Amazon has blocked my IP from Web Scraping.
HTML pulled does not match HTML on page.
When I run the get request i get a Response [500] meaning an internal server error.

Just to let anyone else know that is running into this issue.
At least we did a web scraping project earlier in the bootcamp that I can review."
HiOtQMcI5wg,"If getting stuck 14:49   to get title , Below code works for me.

HiOtQMcI5wg,Successfully completed this too. I learned a new thing today . Thank you so much Alex. yet to complete remaining
HiOtQMcI5wg,"14:49  -  this video dosent work as Amazon found a way to encrypt the html page if it detects a bot. (trying in 2025).

ALTERNATE WAY: instead of making the request and getting the html page, download the page manually from browser and save it in TXT file. use the TXT file to pass the html page to your 'soup1' variable and continue the video. (basically bypass the step where you request the page and getting caught by Amazon)

code will be like:
html_code = pd.read_csv(""file.txt"")
soup1 = BeautifulSoup(html_code, 'html.parser')

HOPE THIS HELPS! IT WORKED FOR ME! cheers 🍻"

HiOtQMcI5wg,"Anyone struggling with get_text() error, try putting this ( ""Priority"": ""u=0, i"" ) in your headers variable after User-agent. If this doesn't work, try to copy everything from the headers section in httpbin and see if you still get the error. If this works, you can start emitting the unnecessary headers one by one! Hope this helps!"
HiOtQMcI5wg,Great tutorial! Quick question: can HasData help with scraping more complex Amazon pages with dynamic content?
HiOtQMcI5wg,"Heads up... Amazon can IP block you if they want for web scraping. Aside from being outdated, this is just not worth the headache, but shout out and props to Alex for putting this together."
HiOtQMcI5wg,"Thanks for the insights! Quick question: when scraping Amazon, has anyone tried using HasData instead of adjusting requests?"
HiOtQMcI5wg,Thankssssssssssssssssssss Alex ! ! !
HiOtQMcI5wg,"Hi Alex, thank you very much. I found your video to be very useful, and the community you've built here is amazing. You have yourself a new subscriber. Much love from Britain."

HiOtQMcI5wg,"Hi, why do i get this error ""AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_text'"" i don't understand this can anybody help how to solve this? 
TIA"
HiOtQMcI5wg,"idk if someone is running through the same issue but when it comes to automating the process the code doesn't work, and it throws the following error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_text'.
I looked it up in stack overflow and apparently, it happens because Amazon itself is blocking the request. Does anyone know a way around it?"
HiOtQMcI5wg,Is second part or 20 page web scraping video is released??
HiOtQMcI5wg,"if you dont pull in the data due to the captcha, dont use the headers as second argument."
HiOtQMcI5wg,"Though the project was quite tricky, I got over it.
Thank you so much Alex."
HiOtQMcI5wg,"I can't follow this project if I use a big company like amazon or twitter, I tried with a website from a smaller company and it worked. I'm doing this project in June 2024."

title = soup2.find(id='productTitle').get_text(strip=True)

price_whole = soup2.find(class_='a-price-whole').get_text(strip=True)

HiOtQMcI5wg,"Hi, thank you so much for showing interesting ways we can use web scraping.  While I was watching your video, an ad popped up showing an 'AI web scraping tool'(forgot the name). Just want to know, is it good to use web scraping tools which saves a lot of time in real time projects? Do you recommend any AI web scraping tool? Thank You so much for helping many with your videos!"
HiOtQMcI5wg,"Thanks for the clear tutorial! Any recommendations for reliable proxies to keep my scraping sessions smooth and secure? Came across scraping proxy packages on Proxy-Store, anyone tried them? Are they safe to use?"

HiOtQMcI5wg,"Thank you so much, Alex! Your teaching style has made learning incredibly enjoyable and accessible. I've learned a lot in just one month and completed my portfolio projects, even though I skipped Excel and Power BI for now. Your anecdotes about your dog, family, and personal experiences have added a fun touch to the learning process. Your impact on learners like me is undeniable, and I'm looking forward to purchasing a course from your website soon. Keep up the fantastic work! 🥂🥂"
HiOtQMcI5wg,This project gave me a taste of how challenging web scraping is. Great video that makes things look easy and less intimidating.
HiOtQMcI5wg,I'm watching this in 2024 working on learning all the tools to become a Data Analyst and just realized that the price of the shirt never went up since inflation. I might need to buy myself one now lol
HiOtQMcI5wg,"It's not that he is skilled and dedicated. It's all about cool glasses and a cooler bald head jeez!

/sarc off ;)"
HiOtQMcI5wg,"man i've been battling with the bot blocker from amazon and also some scraping issues with price because the website display was changed a while after this video was uploaded, but I've managed to pull it off so i hope this might help those recent viewers who might be as confused as me when I started writing this code on my own.

apparently you need to divide the second cell so you need to run the soup1 first before you run the soup2, then for the price you need to pull three part of span class=a-price-symbol, span class=a-price-whole, and span class=a-price-fraction and combine it together into 1 new variable (price), then you need to clean it using strip() and replace() to clean the whitespaces and \n's.

hope this helps!"

CUa30M_FPhk,"As a recruiter, the main takeaway that I already knew is that ""Time kills all deals"". In recruiting, you have to move fast because if they are a good candidate, you're not the only company that would want them."
CUa30M_FPhk,"So, basically PwC is not worth it unless you're a grad and you want to work 60+ hrs a week?"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hi Alex,

Which pharma company do you work for? I have watched your whole video, it was very interesting."
CUa30M_FPhk,whats the difference between an interview for a senior data analyst versus an entry level/ junior data analyst interview?
CUa30M_FPhk,Hey Alex love your content. Also came from industry as a SA at PWC. Seems mike Big4 are looking for SME over core consulting candidates. Was a huge learning curve for me but fun picking things up
CUa30M_FPhk,"the hiring manager was right on asking you why you were going backwards to consulting...really long hours and almost no personal time is the target they look for, young unskilled people (right out of college) so they can exploit them at their fullest. you were in the wrong place trying too hard to get into a big4"
CUa30M_FPhk,What was your answer to why you took the opposite road? Going corporate and then going into consulting?
CUa30M_FPhk,"Did you have to do a case study while one of the interviews ?
Thanks"
CUa30M_FPhk,"I found your yt channel week ago, and I already like you. Good luck with your Manager position :)"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Two months, talk about respecting your time."
CUa30M_FPhk,Thanks Alex
CUa30M_FPhk,You're awesome!
CUa30M_FPhk,I had a similar experience as a data consultant for deloitte
CUa30M_FPhk,Cant believe YT recommended this video to me today as I just finished a multiple offer situation for a senior data analyst this week too. I had a similar choice between a senior analytics consultant role with a major financial institution but ultimately chose to take a senior analyst role with a start up. I think it’s really crazy how much the salary bands for data analyst has clearly changed in the last year or 2 with the advent of remote work. Some of the start ups are legit throwing engineer money at senior analysts just to stay competitive with these big fortune 100 companies. Happy to hear that it worked out for you and I hope my new gig will be everything that I want it to be too. Cheers on a great video! Subbed
CUa30M_FPhk,"Damn, 120 to be in that work environment is not worth it. Seems low with those skills."
CUa30M_FPhk,You didnt solve any case problems? This is problematic. I think your knowledge base doesn't deserve a job in PWC.
CUa30M_FPhk,105 to 120k holy crap
CUa30M_FPhk,"Alex is such an honest guy, most people might not share some of this private information. Thank you Alex for all you do.."
CUa30M_FPhk,"About 15 years ago, we received an RFP (Request for Proposal) from a major company - the day before it was due! We cranked out a response and sent it in before the deadline. We were then informed that we were one of two finalist companies. My company was small but comprised of well known leaders in the field; a boutique, specialist firm. 

We were invited for an interview along with the remaining competitor who turned out to be PwC. We walked in and they were immediately ""Oh, it's you!"" They were going to ask interview questions - using my book as the reference! They saw the other person I brought with me and they knew him well too; I planned it that way. We got the deal. Later, for marketing research, I asked the client where PwC was judged to be better than us. They said that PwC had ""really nice brochures..."""
CUa30M_FPhk,"Isn't speaking in depth about your previous data work in your previous company a beach is data protection law?
Absolutely."
CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulations Alex! Love your channel!
Hope to find a Data Analytics job soon enough)"
CUa30M_FPhk,"I 100% agree.  I just got a consultant/analyst role and they were getting applicants left and right with plenty of SQL experience, but I got the position because they are an ERP/CRM implementation and support company which I have obtained extensive knowledge of over my previous roles."
CUa30M_FPhk,massive congrats to you Alex !! thank you for inspring me as well as other viewers. keep on the great work !
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hi Alex, I am wondering which is the best course (and which Uni) to study to become a Data Analyst ?"
CUa30M_FPhk,Interesting. I'm astonished you had next to no technical questions though.
CUa30M_FPhk,Thanks for sharing your story. Great to hear your feedback.
CUa30M_FPhk,Congratulations Alex. You’re literally hot cakes now
CUa30M_FPhk,Hello Alex.  I decided to quit a Data Science Master's Degree that I enrolled on online after I found out about all the other resources like Khan Academy and Udemy through you. It sounds like knowing the skill is more important than having an expensive Master's Degree. I'm pretty sure i did the right thing. Congratulations to you Sir.
CUa30M_FPhk,Crazy 105-150 k per year sounds crazy. While football player could get that amount in a week. I know it is different thing. But still. There is so much unbalance resources spread in the world. The person back door that make improvement to this world to become better really get paid by a peanut
CUa30M_FPhk,"120k a year is pretty low for a *_senior_* consultant in a technical role, especially for a really large consulting firm like PwC.

Consulting is a notoriously intense line of work. Despite what they told you in the interview, you always go into those jobs knowing you're going to be working long hours. They know that and they compensate you accordingly. They retain you with money, not by making you happy. And you end up having to sacrifice plenty of things if you want to keep that salary.

The fact that you don't know this makes me feel you would have burnt out quickly because of misaligned expectations. There just aren't enough hours in a week to run a youtube channel, spend time with your family, sleep _and_ have a consulting job."
CUa30M_FPhk,Hi thanks for giving information about data analytics course.I am thinking to do this course from google and I don’t have any experience and I am also 40 years😊
CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulations on the new managerial position!  I just started at one of the big 4 about a month ago.  My interview process was pretty much identical, though I am in a different tech related field.  One of the reasons why they are SO into domain knowledge rather than technical knowledge is that, to be honest, there are hordes of people who can do the technical part, but it is more difficult to find someone who can sit in front of a HUGE client and really dig out all of the details of the project from them.  Then that same person needs to relay that information to the developers so they can do the coding work.
Consultants, at the big 4 level, are more advisors and SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) than coders. 

If anyone has any questions about what it is like to be a consultant in the big 4, I would be happy to share my experiences."
CUa30M_FPhk,Congratulations on your new job! Thanks YouTube referred your videos to my homepage. Absolutely love all your videos
CUa30M_FPhk,I’m so proud of you baby! Your transparency and candor is so brave and admirable! Keep it up! ♥️
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hi Alex, - silly question - age = 40yrs with no experience in coding / data science (the person has been working on the oil patch for more than a decade) ...is it too late to train to be data scientist / ML eng? Most of the jobs require a few yrs experience which in this case (data science) is 0. Whats your take on it? Should the person try something else?"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Great insights. Could you suggest few good reads regarding the pharma domain. I have worked in the same domain, but I want to learn more about the same. Any video/links about pharma domain?"
CUa30M_FPhk,hey alex even i m trying to get the job in data analyst is that possible for fresher can u just guide me
CUa30M_FPhk,Tableau is best or power bi for data analyst?
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hey Alex, thanks for sharing your interview experience. Congrats on the manager position! :D"
CUa30M_FPhk,Thanks for sharing your valuable insights! Best of luck in your new gig
CUa30M_FPhk,Why there're too many interviews?
CUa30M_FPhk,"I agree that just stonewalling a recruiter on salary can result in wastes of time, however, I still don't think you should give a range because you could be low balling yourself. If a recruiter is pushing for a number, I'd ask the recruiter what the salary range is for the position and will just say yes or no if that range is worth moving forward (without them knowing if you are jumping with joy or they need to hit the top of the range to get you :) but this way you still get the desired result of both of you knowing you aren't wasting anyone's time.

Great content as always, thanks Alex, and looking forward to hearing your perspective on the management role!"
CUa30M_FPhk,domain knowledge?
CUa30M_FPhk,"Alex, thanks for being one of the most transparent and genuine people in the Analytics realm here on YouTube. I remember subscribing to you when you ad like 100 subs and now you're at 100k thanks to those qualities!"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulations mann, I am pursuing some courses for the same. Your videos actually help alot, thanks for the videos ❤️🔥"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulations, Alex.
I appreciate your down-to-earth approach. Your disposition to your YouTube channel issue is also very commendable.
I hope you are able to keep it up.
All the best on your new role."
CUa30M_FPhk,Do you think is possible to find a remote job as a data analyst if I am in another country (not USA)?
CUa30M_FPhk,I really love how honest and real you are with your experience. It really helps us all to consider this type of careers and also to preapare ourselves!
CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulation on your new role. You have inspired me a lot, Alex. I have learned through your helpful contents and hopefully I can get something in the future. Thanks thanks thanks a lot!!!"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Started watching these videos 1 year ago and since then I've gone HR admin to now getting an HR Data and System Analyst Lead, I honestly can't thank you enough for these videos, Thanks Alex :)"
CUa30M_FPhk,Im new in this data analyst jobs and im just starting to learn withe one of the courses you recommend. But I need to know if your advices for getting jobs applys for remote jobs or primarly to get full time jobs in the USA?
CUa30M_FPhk,"Congratulations on scoring the interview and in your decision to move in a more project management oriented path.    My take on Travel-having been in a role that was 3 weeks every month, travel from M-Thursday and back in the office on Friday.   It's not all it is cracked up to be. It puts a strain on families and relationships (it was single-handedly the reason my first wife and I divorced). Most of all, it's simply exhausting. 

That's my take…YMMV."
CUa30M_FPhk,"Alex,thank you very much. I'm starting out in Data Analytics and I was kindly requesting if you can recommend a book on the subject that would help me"
CUa30M_FPhk,Congratulations! Just applied for Data Analyst position at PwC.
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hey Alex that great...! I watched to whole video to check whether any changes interview process of PwC. Seems likes it not changed but like the fact that you experienced it! 
Thanks for great content! 👍 love it always"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Very Informative Video, Thanks For Sharing Your Story Alex!"
CUa30M_FPhk,If possible would you make a video on terminologies associated with the pharma industry and how data modelling is done by analysts for data analysis?
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hey!, greetings from Colombia, im a DA too for a big 4, but is not a direct contract, your videos inspire me to keep going Thanks a lot!"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hi Alex. My name is Sodeeq, I am an upcoming data analyst, learnt a major of the tools needed, excel, R, SQL, Tableau (not completely) but despite all the knowledge I've acquired, I still can't bring myself to do any project. I'd be very glad if you could provide any guidance for me in the is journey, tried to get your mail, but I couldn't, I'd be extremely glad if you could reach back to me. Thank you."
CUa30M_FPhk,Congratulations dear Alex
CUa30M_FPhk,"thank you Alex for sharing, i am currently taking the Google certification you talked about in 1 of the previous video, i am hoping after this, i should be ready for a data analyst entry job interview."

CUa30M_FPhk,Congrats! Great and insightful content as usual and I'm sure we're all more than grateful that you stood your ground with this YouTube channel. Your videos help me on my self-teaching data analytics  journey immensely.
CUa30M_FPhk,Alex read your emails! I sent you a mentorship request!
CUa30M_FPhk,"In my experience, best way to get into a big 4 company is through employee referral. They get preference on the ""interest"" scale. But it's not a 100%."
CUa30M_FPhk,"Very interesting about the primary focus being on your industry knowledge. I guess that truly is more rare, and most firms can assume that any reasonably bright person can be taught or learn the data analysis stuff."
CUa30M_FPhk,What camera you use for your videos Alex?
CUa30M_FPhk,"Thanks for the deep dive. Very helpful. But why do I have a sense you were more like Ben Affleck saying ""Retainnnerrr"" during the Good Will Hunting interview scene???"
CUa30M_FPhk,Let´s gooooo. My dude over here about to spill the tea.
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hey Alex, what does a Catalog Quality Specialist(at Amazon) do? Do you think it would be a good starting point as a data-analyst wanna-be with no experience? I've been asked if I would be interested in that job just now. Hoping for an answer from you!"
CUa30M_FPhk,"New subscriber, one question as a data scientist can I work in machine learning and AI ?"
CUa30M_FPhk,Great vid. Keep up mate.
CUa30M_FPhk,"Thank you for sharing your story Alex. It was really interesting to hear the entire process that you went through. 
I recently got accepted into a Data Analytics role and I like to attribute part of my success to the interview prep videos, SQL tutorials, and the guided projects you shared on your channel. 

I can't say thank you enough for your commitment to this channel, and the knowledge you are able to share to so many people like myself."
CUa30M_FPhk,That's great more wins to you my mentor
CUa30M_FPhk,"Wow, bold move, putting the people (YT) before the position. Much love from the YT community, your content has helped me out a lot as I continue to grow as a data analyst."
CUa30M_FPhk,Thanks for this video Alex
CUa30M_FPhk,"Thank you Alex, for this valuable insight into the interview process for PwC. Especially since it was for a senior position. There doesn't seem to be much info on the net about how these types of interviews go. Keep up the good work!

I would also like to apologize for my conspiracy theorist-esque comment on your ""I am no longer a data analyst"" video. I guess I was just scared of possibly loosing access to high quality free content like this some day!"
CUa30M_FPhk,Great video and insight 👍🏾
CUa30M_FPhk,it may be out of data analyst context but i really like how your videos are very calming. maybe u can make a video on how you record your videos
CUa30M_FPhk,"Alex i want to ask one question:
Is google data analytics certificate give me financial analytic job ?"
CUa30M_FPhk,"great video as usual, alex"
CUa30M_FPhk,"Hey Alex,

CUa30M_FPhk,"Very interesting to hear about your experience. Thanks for sharing this, Alex!"
CUa30M_FPhk,Is it necessary to learn data structures and Algorithms for a aspiring data analyst?

DKrSgSy6F1o,"I’m a student working towards a Data Analytics degree. What are some good jobs to apply for (related to data analytics) that don’t require a degree or a lot of experience?

I was thinking Data Entry was somewhat related and does not require a lot of skill or experience."
DKrSgSy6F1o,"Nice to see you, I am happy, once again simple with doubt, difference between power bi developer and analyst"
DKrSgSy6F1o,"Congratulations Alex , Alex the Analyst channel to the moon 😀"
DKrSgSy6F1o,"I wanted to ask, I'm more familiar with python but if I want to take the Google learning path with R, can I learn R with Google or I should take a separate course on R?"
DKrSgSy6F1o,"Congratulations Mr Alex analytics inspiration. I'm in Nigeria in Africa currently learning Data analysis on Udemy, hopefully soon I'll be able to take the Google analytics course on Coursera.
You're a blessing sir.
Congratulations on reaching 100k subscribers."
DKrSgSy6F1o,Congrats for reaching 100k
DKrSgSy6F1o,If the manager thing doesn't work out maybe sign up for Cameo and do mustache shaving messages???
DKrSgSy6F1o,"Everything you can do in Alteryx you can do in SQL Server with CTE’s, Stored Procedures, Power Query, and python almost for free. Idk why companies pay so much money for it."
DKrSgSy6F1o,"Congrats again Alex on the 100k milestone, the new role and thanks for the casual Q&A!"
DKrSgSy6F1o,Hi Alex.  Yay you sound better. I just want to say that I recall you saying that you might show us your tattoo if you reached 100k.  I have not forgotten that😂
DKrSgSy6F1o,"glad to see u're good, welcome back! Sad to see that mustache going, but yeah, it get in the way, hehe."
DKrSgSy6F1o,Hello alex i hope you are fine ..we missed you alot
DKrSgSy6F1o,Good morning
DKrSgSy6F1o,Hi
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congrats Alex!!! A really big step forward, well done!"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Pwc is certainly not one of the best consulting firms😂
_zxPx1PQCqI,A year late but good luck to you. I’m a specialist in a specific area. After a long career I realised I liked to “DO” rather than to manage.
_zxPx1PQCqI,14:38 -- I could see tears... Hope you're all okay in life now
_zxPx1PQCqI,Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings throughout the whole process of changing your career. This is very valuable for an intermediate data analyst who started to think about the future career path!!
_zxPx1PQCqI,"I laughed at ""if they already valued you, they would've already given you the money/position"" because I JUST said that to my sister. She stayed with the company though."
_zxPx1PQCqI,Product owner is higher in rank than manager on IT side.
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations Alex  you are  amazing !!
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hey congratulations Alex on finding a data role you're more excited about! 

So it sounded like you left your previous data analyst role in the heathcare company is that right? If i am, I am interested in becoming a data analyst for a health/healthcare company.  I have a question on skills, other than the standard excel/spreadsheets, python, r, tableau and SQL skills - are there additional skills required for the healthcare industry?"
_zxPx1PQCqI,TLDR?
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congrats and recover well. 💪
_zxPx1PQCqI,"If I can give a second reason to always go with the other job over staying. Playing the “I’m quitting” card, only really works once and flags you as someone they need to be replacing. I see it happen all the time. They take the stay offer, and get replaced within a year or two. Sometimes they are desperate to keep you just to give time so they can replace you comfortably."
_zxPx1PQCqI,Is it just me or his moustache looks like the guy on Pringles?
_zxPx1PQCqI,Jalapenos
_zxPx1PQCqI,you're that egg guy from sanic
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Thank you so much for keeping things so real and relateable.  Congrats on your string of brilliant career choices and the latest promotion.  You inspired me! Hopefully, I'll be chatting with you next year as a data analyst :)"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Cool mustache 👌👌
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hi Mr. Alex
First i would to thank you about big effort for people actaully you don't know them and you feel happy and satisfy when you help them so i would to motivate you and give you the love and the respect which you deserve them
Second if i am not alive in usa is any opportunity to me to work with american companies and is there real opportunity to work without involving in cyber crimes or something like that or no Finally thank you for everything"
_zxPx1PQCqI,"your videos are my serious classes, i have programmed myself because of you."
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congrats man, a good one!"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congrats on moving up 2 floors 😃😄
_zxPx1PQCqI,Changing careers and just started my journey with a D.A. can't wait to get to that point where I can reject a job because it doesn't align with my values.
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Great come back, I am new to your videos and I am very excited to have found a great tutor."
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hi Alex, I'm thinking Data or Business Analysis may be over my head and too time consuming for my personal life situation.  Any suggestions for more entry-level  IT job titles?  And thanks for the real deal informative videos!"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Shave the beard!
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Thank you Alex your advice has motivated me and I am so excited about becoming a Data Analyst. I am on week 4 of the Google Data Analytics thanks to you. Keep up the amazing work, you have no idea of the impact that your videos make and you have the voice for the job😆. Thank you."
_zxPx1PQCqI,hi been watching your videos and i love them. Could you mentor me perhaps? I want to do a career swap
_zxPx1PQCqI,Dump the Data Analyst but keep the mustache!!  It is AWSOME!!! I wish I could grow one like it!
_zxPx1PQCqI,谢谢！
_zxPx1PQCqI,I love this guy
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Thank you for sharing. I agree with you when you say that if they valued you, they would have offer you the position/salary already.  I would love to say that out loud, but what are some phrases that you actually say when exiting a job that tries this?"
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hi, I just started to watch ur channel last night about 5 things not to be data analyst.. and this is my 2nd video watching ur content. but from what I can tell, that this channel will be a good channel !! so I'll subscribe now, and I really like how you do content about what u are doing in ur job right now, about your perception. I got a lot to say, to compliment but I'll just keep it short :) hope u read this and it make ur days 

and last thank you for making this channel"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congrats on a very deserved chance to grow in your career!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations on your new position!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Hey Alex but will you continue to upload content about Data Analyst?
_zxPx1PQCqI,I'm super doubtful on switching to management or staying technical. I will appreciate a LOT management-related videos! Good luck :)
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations on the new job and best wishes for a faster recovery! Thank you for your taking your time and teaching us.
_zxPx1PQCqI,"congrats alex ,,,, goodluck."

_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congrats Alex, your new team is blessed to have you, you're a great teacher"
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Pretty shocked for me (in a good way), I follow you since you’ve became transition to data analyst since first job. You’re nailed it!!! Congratulation with you man, anyway as I was an auditor and studying data analytic right now, I’m quite pity PWC but on your shoes, I thought you choose the right one, Good luck Man"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Snidely Whiplash moustache
_zxPx1PQCqI,Ok so I listened more and I think our careers are aligned. Working on my MBA then planning on an MBA in Data analysis and then management in the future and then teaching business and analysis at the high school or college level. I work for Kroger now and hope to do data analysis for Kroger in the next three to five years. I’m 50 as of august 16. Love your video.
_zxPx1PQCqI,"I just subscribed because I wanted to become a DA now I’m not sure.  In any case ,  I’m glad you’re better"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Can u work remotely as a data analyst?
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Huh, didn't know monopoly guy was a data analyst. Guess we're going to be getting manager videos now?"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Thanks for sharing Alex! :)
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hi Alex, I hope all is well. Great news! So happy for you!"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations on your new job! Well relatively! I took the Excel course on Coursera that you recommended and found it difficult but I learned a lot! Now I started the IBM Introduction to Data Science Specification. Thank you for these videos and glad you wouldn't take a job that would tell you you had to get rid of the videos! It helps so many!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Hope you are well now💕
_zxPx1PQCqI,what company do you work for? I just found the channel and plan to take the courses at the first of the year.
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations! Great to hear you are moving into a new role.
_zxPx1PQCqI,Gotta rename the channel to Alex the Manager
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hello Alex, Congratulations 🎊 Please keep us updated on your new position!"

_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations.. you deserve it!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations!
_zxPx1PQCqI,LOVE TRIANGLE????
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Hey Alex, great video as always. I would love to hear your thoughts on career paths for people who DONT want to go into management?"
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congratz on the new job Alex! You are put in that position so you can inspire more people while you challenge yourself. I can extremely relate when you said ""You don't accept when they come back to you, because if they valued you, they've already offered you that position""."
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congratulations,  I'm so happy for your success."
_zxPx1PQCqI,yes more management content pls !
_zxPx1PQCqI,"I need a data analyst mentor, where can I find one?"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Are you going to change location?
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations man. I wish I could be you.
_zxPx1PQCqI,Hope you're doing ok man
_zxPx1PQCqI,"The best manager in town! Really excited for your new Journey, you're aspiring me to do the same"
_zxPx1PQCqI,"So great!!! Congrats, friend! Please keep bringing us your words of wisdom - I need 'em! Glad you are feeling better, too."
_zxPx1PQCqI,Thanks for sharing your journey Alex. This had been a great help 👍
_zxPx1PQCqI,either the mustache goes or I do! :-)
_zxPx1PQCqI,Glad you’ve recovered. Congratulations on your new job / career path. 🌅🏆
_zxPx1PQCqI,Uts really awesome congrats bro..
_zxPx1PQCqI,Gonna change your name to Alex the manager now? Congrats.
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Not long ago, I found your channel...absolutely love your content! I've learned so much from you...Thanks Alex for staying with us and saying that giving up your Youtube channel is a non-negotiable. LOVE IT...STICK IT TO THE MAN!!!! LOL"
_zxPx1PQCqI,God bless you abundantly
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations
_zxPx1PQCqI,I want to work under you!!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Glad ur better!!!
_zxPx1PQCqI,You have a new subscriber. I’m really happy to hear you are doing better. Major congratulations!!!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations! I came to your channel thinking of getting some info on data analysts but after seeing this video I am in two minds lol. I am from management background and not sure if I should continue with management or change to data analytics.
_zxPx1PQCqI,Your new job title sounds like something Dwight would write on his business card 🤣
_zxPx1PQCqI,I think it's ridiculous for companies to expect you to give up other things in your life to have a job with them.  Working for them isn't your whole life.
_zxPx1PQCqI,"The abundance of options is just so awesome, I am very happy for you and I hope to reach your position."
_zxPx1PQCqI,"My last name is Abushanab, it means a man with a big mustache. So now you became part of the family. Alex Abushanab 👐"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Sir which corse is good
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congrats Alex :)
_zxPx1PQCqI,If someone want you to mentor him what should he do?
_zxPx1PQCqI,The amount of um's was almost unbearable
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congrats Alex on your new job. Awwww 100K!!!! Awesome!!!!
_zxPx1PQCqI,take care man..!
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Alex, this video is very helpful for me. I am on the verge of changing my job from financial analysis (in investment fund) to data analist position. I have similar thougths, because my working conditions are good and I'm sure the company will be trying to keep me. On the other hand, I don't have opportunity to get promotion because it's a small company and I've become interested in data analysis which I believe better suits my predispositions. I will be making decision in next few months."
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Gratz Alex dude, wish you the best luck!"
_zxPx1PQCqI,Smart to be super selective. You owe it to yourself.
_zxPx1PQCqI,Do you think StrataScratch is good platform for learning coding? Thanks!
_zxPx1PQCqI,Nice mustache!
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congrats there Alex!!! Wow, that's a shocker!  ;)"
_zxPx1PQCqI,"Congratulations Alex, very proud of you man."
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congratulations! Your team is so lucky to have you! 🥰
_zxPx1PQCqI,Congrats Alex! The way you engage with your subscribers and your willingness to share  knowledge and guidance I can totally understand why your company will not want to lose an employee like you. All the best in your new role. Looking forward to the new content!
UGF49YZZRNc,"Know a fair bit of power bi atm, looking at more sql, got a few decent projects to show off... Hope I'm gonna land something soon ;)"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Or like Chandler (from Friends)- he accepted a job offer that required horseback riding skills and... signed up for horseback riding lessons :D:D:D 
Half-joking/ half-serious, but many companies have such a low level of HR knowledge/ awareness that they could make a problem out of something so simple (they don't understand that the ""technical part"" is the easiest part when you have the right ""attitude""/ talents/ DNA/ etc.)."
UGF49YZZRNc,Thanks for having been part of my data journey!
UGF49YZZRNc,"Wow
The best video I have watched from Nigeria 🎉
I have been having sleepless nights on issues that I know a lot of power bi and excel and some of SQL
I was thinking I can't apply cos I need perfection 

Thanks 
I will start applying as soon as possible"
UGF49YZZRNc,You're a God sent
UGF49YZZRNc,Winter arc is about to go crazy
UGF49YZZRNc,"I think I have intermediate level sql, python and excel. I just need to practice more and create more projects before starting to apply. thank you for reassuring me that I dont have to be perfect before applying to a job. I'll update when I land a job"
UGF49YZZRNc,How many jobs can I apply per day via LinkedIn (Maximum)?
UGF49YZZRNc,Thanks Alex. Could you recommend websites apart from Linkedin for securing fully remote jobs.
UGF49YZZRNc,Anyone got job recently?
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hey Alex, thank you for all your courses. I followed them all and I am now a full data analyst🎉. Thank you this won't be possible without you.

But is it possible for a Nigerian (West African country) citizen and resident to have a remote job in USA or similar countries?"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hey Alex, thank you so much for these videos! How can I test myself for Python, would you recommend LeetCode for that as well?"
UGF49YZZRNc,Hi thanx for the video. Is it possible that I get an injob training for data analyst job. Please help
UGF49YZZRNc,"What about R over python? Like the google certificate program teaches R instead of python, should I be looking to learn python in addition to R or do you think R is good enough to get started?"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Alex. i would really love to build my resume, can you please post the link to your video on how to build a data analyst centered resume."
UGF49YZZRNc,"Ive done alot of things but Im still not getting a job... Been applying to entry level positions, I need help pls 😢😢😢... Ive got a portfolio and resume and set up my accounts"
UGF49YZZRNc,"How about this combo?   SQL, Python, Tableau   or SQL, R, Tableau?  But I feel these 3 are not enough. You should have spreadsheets under the belt as well (both google sheets and excel). There is a redundancy of skills here from my point of view and that is because I am speaking as an outsider. At the moment, I don't know how companies actually utilize these above skillsets. 
SQL can manipulate  large amount of data  very quickly and efficiently so there should be no need for excel manipulations. Once data is cleaned in SQL and ready for analysis, it can be imported in Excel for whatever reasons (for reports, to share with management) so you don't need Excel that much (of course it is good to have the deep skills in it). Similarly, what is Python used for? Mostly for automation, doing complex ""calculations"" fast. They say it is used in data science model (like numpy etc) [I am not familiar with it yet]. I am learning Python at the moment and doing the object oriented part but not sure if OOP is really needed for data analysis.  Tableau, you defninitly need. It produces very good visualization. One should go deep in it. The google sheet chart capability sucks."
UGF49YZZRNc,Needed this piece of advide at this point of time! Thanks a lot
UGF49YZZRNc,I recently got my first ever job and it's data related (Reporting Specialist). Thanks to you Alex. Your videos helped me a lot to learn all those technical skills❤
UGF49YZZRNc,amazing
UGF49YZZRNc,Thank you Sir. I have some of this skills. Please which online platform do you recommend for jobs?
UGF49YZZRNc,I am no where near ready
UGF49YZZRNc,"By the standards in this video, im ready to apply and inhave been applying but i havent got a call back. Do you have any tips to increase my chances?"
UGF49YZZRNc,Please alex where do you find this jobs
UGF49YZZRNc,Is it realistic to find a remote-based entry level data analyst job?
UGF49YZZRNc,Thank you for the valuable advice!!! ❤
UGF49YZZRNc,Hey Alex! I have basic - intermidiatishhh knowledge of handling databases with R language as well. How good of a skill is that for a data analyst ?
UGF49YZZRNc,That was really what I needed to hear
UGF49YZZRNc,Pls can someone put me through on how to write my entry level data analyst CV
UGF49YZZRNc,"I so needed to hear this. I already knew before this video that I wasn't ready to apply for jobs, but this video made me realize I'm a lot closer than I thought! I've been putting so much pressure on myself to know SQL, Excel, Tableu and Python really well, and this has relieved some of my anxiety about getting a new job soon. Thanks again, Alex 😌!"
UGF49YZZRNc,thanks for this
UGF49YZZRNc,Comment section filled with bots
UGF49YZZRNc,2:27 so true!
UGF49YZZRNc,"Everytime i watch video of Alex, i learn something new."
UGF49YZZRNc,"my case is also same as Alex i have completed google data analytics in nov-2022 from that time i dig almost every area of SQl server, i think  some times they just want fundamental knowledge for entry level job.......its been 15 days of starting pandas as i get confident i start getting applying for jobs 
some peoples are like that until they get satisfied they never step forward.....but its a valid point by Alex in video if you have strong fundamentals do start for job applying."
UGF49YZZRNc,"I think what I need to the confidence to do a project to add to my portfolio by myself , I’ve watched and completed the portfolio projects you have on your page but getting started on my own with data is hard for me ."
UGF49YZZRNc,"I personally haven't move on to a visualization tool like tableau or Power Bi but my question is when you say learn two, investment in Python has far steeper learning curve so why isn't that mention? Is the assumption that the weight is equal? should I just learn the two topic that require the least amount of hours to be job ready?"
UGF49YZZRNc,"I had an interview I thought went great, but wasn't really asked any technical questions. I thought I was going to get the 2nd interview, but had to hear from the recruiter I wasn't. It put me in a funk for some reason.

I'm getting my mind set back to do some more training so I can feel more experienced since that was why I was rejected."
UGF49YZZRNc,Jalapenos
UGF49YZZRNc,Alex you're God sent to me honestly.
UGF49YZZRNc,"""How come they dont want me man"" 

-will smith voice"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Holy cow, thanks a ton Alex! I love your positive attitude and demeanor towards this subject. I am towards the end of the Google Data Analytics course and was just kind of like... ""What the heck am I getting into? This stuff is way over my head and I have no idea how my very basic level knowledge is gonna do a lick of good to help any company."" Lots of doubt, lots of thinking that I wasted my time taking courses on data analytics because in the end I wasn't good enough, and all that stuff... But this really sheds some light as to how good companies actually expect me to be in order to land my first job! Thanks again!"
UGF49YZZRNc,I was so asking myself this question this morning!
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hello Alex, I am a little bit discouraged right now. I've been sending resumes for a month now, and haven't been able to place even an enterview yet.

The thing is I'm still studying programming at university (at nights), but I'm already doing pretty well with Python and SQL, I've made Dashboards for clients and I have some work experience already (less than 1 year in Data Analysis related work). Ah, I'm taking the Google Data Analytics Course in coursera also. 

Where I live, it seems that recruiters are only interesed in people with a degree and around 3 years of experience 🙄"
UGF49YZZRNc,Hey Alex. Is it enough to know Power BI and Sql to start applying for position Data Analyst in 2022?I live in Serbia. How can i improve my knowledge of Excel and Python?
UGF49YZZRNc,"I am from Germany and i believe, the German job market is different than the US. I am going through the requirements list of jobs and they are asking everything like excel, python/r, BI/Tableau, SQL., and above this they asking for some cloud tech tools and other techs. data bricks, apache-spark, ec2, s3, google analytics, SSIS, and much more. So what should I do? Right now I am focusing on 4 top skills, should apply to these jobs? and one more question, the German market is kind of divided into three parts. First: AWS pipeline, Second: Azur pipeline, Third: open-sources pipeline. I can't decide from three which part should I focus. I can't learn everything. what is suggestions?"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hey Alex., although I am able to solve some leetcode questions of easy to moderate level, I later tend to forget the solutions and i  often get self-doubts on my interview preparation. Is this common as a data analytics fresher?"
UGF49YZZRNc,"I've been really worried that learning a heavy programming language like Python was mandatory to become a successful data analyst, maybe that's not so much the case after all! Great thank you!

I'm going to put my full focus this year into learning SQL, Excel and Tableau then start applying!"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex, Thanks in large part to your videos, I just landed my first data analyst job!! Thank you!
I'm switching from a completely non-technical field (my college degree is in the Humanities, and my most recent job experience is in a library), but I studied on my own and followed your great advice! Thanks for putting this awesome content out there into the world!
Btw, for all those in the grind: I studied early mornings over the course of 1 1/2 years - did it with a family, had a baby during that period, kept at it! You can do it!!"
UGF49YZZRNc,"If I prefer R to python, am I still good to go?"
UGF49YZZRNc,"OMG, thank you for the video,.I am getting really overwhelmed rn because I feel like all the companies are hiring for ppl who know everything (cloud computing, API, ETL, SQL, Looker and endless skills). I am trying to switch career. When I read the JD, I am really thinking I am never going to make it. Your video makes me feel a lot more confident now."
UGF49YZZRNc,Absolutely love your content and delivery of info. Would you possibly do a video on domains for data science & analysis? I’m new to data and I’m not seeing much on this. What are they and what does data science look like within them? Which soft skills translate to which more easily maybe?
UGF49YZZRNc,"Alex, thank you so much for this video! I am interviewing for a data analyst position and feel like I am not ready because there is still a lot I don't know about sql and python even though the position only asked for a basic knowledge in these two (which I do know, thanks to you!) But after I watch this video, I feel a lot more confident that I do have the skills that they are looking for."
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hello Alex, I currently hold a masters in healthcare informatics. I am having trouble finding a job in this field. I am wondering if I should be focusing on data scientist or data analyst. I don’t have much experience when it comes to SQL, Python etc . I am wondering if I should consider enrolling in a data analytics Boot Camp. What are your thoughts?

I have not had any luck with exposure to the field as I work in HR benefits currently and my internship was terminated early due to COVID. I will start watching your videos on SQL. I know that will help"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex. Thanks for sharing your experience. I know sql and excel, I am watching online pyhton course and waiting for my DA-100 course to start within a month. I got support and approval from my boss  to go in this path. My current job is Jewellery Photographer but these data things are in my head all the time."
UGF49YZZRNc,"Wanted to give you a big shout out! Your videos motivated me to start applying and interviewing for jobs. I had a bit of imposter syndrome going on. I could check off two of the skills you mentioned at an expert level, so I started to apply like a mad man. Now I've landed a data analyst job and I'm getting my master's in data analytics at the same time. Things are definitely coming along and you played a big part. Thank you!!!"
UGF49YZZRNc,Had 2 interviews for some company all they ask if I knew r and Tableau and I was like yeah. I also had to talk about myself. Next week hey you want a job? I think my degree basically got me job. Have masters in business analytics.
UGF49YZZRNc,"Thanks a lot Alex , this was what i was looking for."
UGF49YZZRNc,"thank you very much for this video Alex. just got done with my program and was having the usual elf doubt about applying. im very good at Excel, SQL and Power BI, while still polishing my Python skills, so this video filled me with a lot of confidence. thanks"
UGF49YZZRNc,I am good at both Python and SQL. But...no HR is getting back to me yet. Sigh.
UGF49YZZRNc,Loving your videos!! Thank you!!! Data Analyst in the making here
UGF49YZZRNc,"just wanna say thanks
I watch your video when I fell down on my journey of becoming a analyst"
UGF49YZZRNc,Alex please be my coach!!!!…. I’m in my last year of obtaining a degree in data analytics….. Bu the way I watch all ur adds lol….. I really enjoy listening to you!!!
UGF49YZZRNc,i am located in egypt  was wondering best freelancing sites to start data analyst career even to gain  experience money is not important now .
UGF49YZZRNc,"Just Awesome Brother 
You always Keeping me to go Ahead and stay positive 
Thank you !"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hello Alex, I want to become a data analyst. I have just completed my graduation in Mathematics 🇮🇳. Now I'm looking forward to persue pg diploma in Big analytics in Canada. It is a 2 year course in Lambton college with co op in last semester. I am working on Google data analytics certificate course. I have basic knowledge of python, sql and excel. AM I ON THE RIGHT PATH? CAN YOU GIVE SOME SUGGESTIONS?"
UGF49YZZRNc,I BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU! Hahaha Back in March I saw a video of yours that really got me into data analytics! I may I started the Google Certified for Data Analysis! AND I BEEN LOOKING for your videos! Finally I am done with the course and about to start applying to places and here you are! I made sure to subscribe to not loose you again! hahaha Love your content!
UGF49YZZRNc,Hey alex ! how are you ? Just wanted to ask if i can be data analyst without a degree?
UGF49YZZRNc,i am near zero at math - can i learn python?
UGF49YZZRNc,"I’m a student working towards a Data Analytics degree. What are some good jobs to apply for (related to data analytics) that don’t require a degree or a lot of experience?

I was thinking Data Entry was somewhat related and does not require a lot of skill or experience."
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex, love your videos and projects but I have a question for which im troubling to find the solution as an inexperienced data analyst. What's the best way to present your insights and thoughts from a dataset in a PDF/PPT"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex, have a question that: When do a project follows a tutorial then put it in a CV, do we need to write that this is the project we did by following a tutorial."
UGF49YZZRNc,"Welp. I'd started applying a couple of months ago and hit a jackpot recently. I'm starting my very first Jr. Data and Analytics Development position on Monday :D

Thanks for the SQL project vids, they helped me get some bare bone basics that I was able to expound upon during the interview :)"
UGF49YZZRNc,"I don't get a fresher job because I don't have experience, and
I don't have experience because I didn't have a job (True story)"
UGF49YZZRNc,"I just had a second-round interview today with a cool company and I thought it went really well. Hopefully I get the job!

Edit: I got the job!"
UGF49YZZRNc,Thank you so much
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hello Alex, I am from India and I wanted to know if your videos are valid in India or not! Sorry to ask but just had a doubt. Hope to hear from you soon."
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hey Alex could you make a video about these certificates if you had the opportunity to take one of them and if they are worth the money either for skills taught or for being suitable in case of a new job?
Certified Analytics Professional (CAP)
IIBA Entry Certificate in Business Analysis (ECBA)
IIBA Certification of Competency in Business Analysis (CCBA)
IIBA Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP)
IIBA Agile Analysis Certification (AAC)
IIBA Certification in Business Data Analytics (CBDA)
IQBBA Certified Foundation Level Business Analyst (CFLBA)
IREB Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering (CPRE)
PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PBA)"
UGF49YZZRNc,Dude you're the man. I love your vids and your calm demeanor and simple explanations really reduce a lot of doubt and stress I put on myself. Thank you so much.
UGF49YZZRNc,"Am totally green about anything concerning computer science and data science as well, do you have any advise to that or else any help"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Sir please make a video on Google Data analytics apprenticeship , What it is and what are the benefits."
UGF49YZZRNc,Thankyou sir u are really helping us a lot in landing a job
UGF49YZZRNc,"Thank you, Alex."
UGF49YZZRNc,Hey Alex! I recently saw a job posting for a BI analyst position! They required a data analyst course/certification that had a statistics base. Which course/cert would you recommend to check this box?
UGF49YZZRNc,Dont forget R!!! So many aspiring data analysts are only picking up Python which makes it much easier to get into companies that use R as their go to programming language for statistical analysis and visualization.
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hey Alex , Can you please make a video on how much statistics do you need to know to get started as a data analyst , How much statistics do you personally use , Thx"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex, I took a 19 week data analytics course and have certs in Google Analytics and Tableau Desktop. Im thinking I need to pick up SQL (learned the basics in the program) while I apply. How large should my portfolio be?"
UGF49YZZRNc,have you any data analytics tutorial first to last?
UGF49YZZRNc,"Man your help and links are precious. Just messed up 3 interviews when companies tested my SQL level and I failed the tests. Certificates are not good enough. Peactice, practice, practice 😎"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex, thank you for all the videos, they've been very helpful in preparing me for a career switch to data analyst. I have gone through all your videos I think, and I have also carried out all the processes. Please, where can I get more data to practice, I feel I need to do some more data cleaning, visualization, etc. I think you recommended a platform in 1 of the video, I have been trying to locate which of the classes but couldn't. Kindly assist!"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Good morning, I’ll like to get somebody who can put me though this."
UGF49YZZRNc,Can you do one on entry level remote jobs
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hey Alex 
I have a question if you don’t mind please,did you got your bachelor or just certificates ,I have an associate in computer programming,I got good skills with sql server,excel/vba and others programmes.so I am trying to figure out if it’s worth it to get my bachelor and add other certificates or just get the certifactes 
Thank you very much in advance"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi Alex could you make a video about what maths notions are needed on being a data analyst/business analyst vs data scientist 
I’m still deciding between being a data analyst/business intelligence by the age of 24 vs becoming a data scientist by the age of 26/27, I’m 22 currently"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Hi, Alex. I've been watching your videos for 1-2 weeks now. Question: Do you think it's necessary to know BOTH PowerBI and Tableau before applying? It seems like if you can learn one, you can learn the other and it also seems like the one you'll use at work depends entirely on what company you end up working for. I figure that focusing on just one would let me get to the point where I'm ready to apply more quickly, while still showing that I have visualization skills."
UGF49YZZRNc,Is Data Analyst an evergreen career? I am still in dilemma of picking my career path. Data Science or Web development 🤔
UGF49YZZRNc,"This is great Alex! (Side note - it's giving off a very Binging with Babish kind of video vibe, which is also good! :) )"
UGF49YZZRNc,"This is on point! I made sure to focus my resume on data analyst relevant skills only and it at least landed me a job interview which was the precursor to me getting my job. One thing that makes you stand out from other tech channels on youtube is the fact that you explain the ""why"" you need to know a certain technical skill. This really helps keep motivation when learning such a skill. I would recommend that in a future video you explain in more depth why you choose these core skills (Excel, SQL, Tableau, or Power BI, Python), and what people should focus on when learning each of these tools because they are so vast and the information overload can easily feel overwhelming"
UGF49YZZRNc,"Do you offer any coaching services? I have about 3 years of SQL work exp in the healthcare field and I want to land a Data Analytics job In the nearby big city, but it feels so impossible and I'm so lost."
UGF49YZZRNc,Hello Alex...could u pls tell me how stressful is a data analyst job
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Did I overdo it with the sound effects? Maybe.

Do I regret it? No."
aLp-6C-p-T0,No one made video about this but this is must video for so many people to understand that y only courses are not going to help you need to do actual practical work and to work on skills
aLp-6C-p-T0,"During the past year, I have been taking multiple classes. I felt that courses are not the best way to learn something. You have to learn by doing. In 2024, I want to increase the number of projects that i do."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I just started learning SQL last Wednesday and I'm a person who can get stuck in a course loop too. I'm at that point where I know I need to start playing around with datasets since I have a decent grasp of at least the very basic commands now, but I guess I'm a bit timid. So I appreciate this message very much! I think I watched this video at the right timing for me to hear it. Thank you Alex for all your insights and wisdom!"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I agree. Start doing courses and finishing them. Once you have done enough, do some guided projects. After you do enough, do some of your own projects and build your portfolio."
aLp-6C-p-T0,There comes a time when knowledge needs to be translated into actual use.
aLp-6C-p-T0,I just saw this video and that exactly what I needed to hear. Thanks once again!
aLp-6C-p-T0,I just signed up for my first course :) im thinking of splitting my time between 50% course material and 50% implementing those strategies with projects !
aLp-6C-p-T0,I love courses 😅 but this video is accurate.
aLp-6C-p-T0,"This course is designed for the challenges I'm facing now.
I have taken a series of courses before without practice. 

I need where and who I can work with as an intern and I can do it for free for anyone that could help me out and mentor me.
I have excel knowledge and little SQL. 
Thanks"
aLp-6C-p-T0,Great message! Agreed! Thank you!
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I feel like there is a balance, you want to learn the fundamentals properly, but then you have to apply them to understand how things work in practice. I think this is an iterative process, learning something, apply it, be confused about another aspect, take a course in that, apply it, confused about another thing, read about it in forums, apply it…etc"
aLp-6C-p-T0,This video came in timely considering I personally decided not to take anymore courses but to build my portfolio this year👍
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Thanks for those words!!
I need to stop doing courses and run away from the course purgatory"
aLp-6C-p-T0,bloom's taxonomy
aLp-6C-p-T0,I feel like your youtube series has helped me learn sql waaay more than any sql courses i've taken. i think what also helped was i used data from twitch to make my own tables and play around with that data
aLp-6C-p-T0,Thank you so much! I hope I will find in your videos how to create a portfolio.
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I've learned a lot of online courses about data analyst for maybe 3-4 months. It feels like, I do nothing without applying it to a real project and I want to start it from this week

But an online course is really helpful if you are from beginner level and doesn't have a background in"
aLp-6C-p-T0,What if the course you are taking is actually a project?
aLp-6C-p-T0,Hey Alex Thank U for that insightful wisdom.  I am concerned on the type of statistics class someone must take for Data Analysis.  Is that a course on Udemy?
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Alex i took more than 10 courses on Data analyst and I cant focus on anyone ... Thanks man , I needed this video"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Hi Alex, I'm from Indonesia. This is my first time learning about data analysts. My background was a programming bachelor's degree, but I have no experience of programming or analyst. In my country, they're always looking for experience for an analyst, so I think it's really hard for me to find a job or even an internship. I've taken a few courses too, and I think it didn't help a lot. Yes, I need practice, a lot of it. Thanks for your video. I'll try my best to keep doing my best as an analyst and put it in my portfolio."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Thank you so much, I bookmarked your links. Love this stuff! Thank you thank you!"
aLp-6C-p-T0,The problem is that I don’t know how to get started with a project. It’s challenging to marry what I’ve learned with what I need to do with what I know.
aLp-6C-p-T0,If Stephen Amell was a Data Analyst
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Hi Sir Alex, I want to take the course for data science, but I am not a bachelors degree holder and I have no experience in this field. am I qualified?"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Course ""purgatory?"" I see you are being generous. 😆 Per data, if you have a city with an open data portal, like Chicago, you can hit up that."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Thanks Alex I hope you are getting better now.
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Hey Alex, what do you think about Datacamp?"
aLp-6C-p-T0,lol I just saved half a dozen guided projects on coursera...thx for the advice
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I have never in my life took a single course. But I wanted to do it now, so I clicked on YouTube and the first video that gets recommended to me is this."
aLp-6C-p-T0,i think i still need a courses to understand the basic. i can't do anything with data if i doesn't even know what process i need to do 😂
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Unreal how many programing videos YouTube suggests...I don't have the slightest interest.

I must have similar likes to people who program.."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I know I'm a course addict. My portfolio is virtually non-existent yet I'm a recent university graduate with a computer science degree. I just don't have strong enough interest in anything to make a meaningful project. As a result, I can't land any job interviews, let alone jobs, since employers are not compelled by my resume's project section. Am I screwed?"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Very true. You need to apply what you learn in the courses straight away in your work or projects, otherwise, it's just head knowledge and soon forget it."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"True,I only do this because HR likes to see this in your resume, if not of this I would busy myself self-studying documentations, books etc. And not courses or certificate"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Do you think taking courses is a by product of the job hiring process as a whole? where ""credentialing"" is the primary motivator for hiring as compared to experience ?"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Wow, i get to know about google's Dataset search!"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"And don't be afraid to fail:  "" The Master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried """
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Some people  just gets enrolled in online Courses just to get ""Certification of Completion"" like me"
aLp-6C-p-T0,Passive vs active learning
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Wow, thanks for sharing. I think it's good business as there is more course taking individuals compared to self project making ppl. It makes sense to advertise new courses and not where to apply using the self project. Besides, I think it is difficult to convince ppl that you know how to without a certificate/course. 
I was told in two interviews that I was lying and don't know what I was talking about. That's cos I wasn't certified. Maybe one should stop with online courses and rather focus on joining a community through certification or being chartered."
aLp-6C-p-T0,I just started being productive from my lazy ass and was going to enroll some courses but youtube recommend me this thing i-
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I have a shit load of courses on Udemy, and I'll take your advice at face value. I'll finish them all eventually, but 2-3 at a time and then apply the knowledge in a few projects."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Stop using imperatives in almost every video title! Getting annoying over time!!
aLp-6C-p-T0,Take my course on how to stop talking courses
aLp-6C-p-T0,Yeah thats True..Now i should Start a Course on 'How to stop Taking Courses' 😂
aLp-6C-p-T0,Same is true for college degrees.  So many people get a college degrees as if that is all they need to get a good job. You need to get actual hand-on experience also.
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I am the same , literally on my last of 11 for the past 6 mths lol... and I made up my mind about actively practicing now that I found an area I can use to maintain my career as a main skill  and the rest as knowledge. I wanted to make sure I can always understand all the departments I deal with (and planned very specific courses to be of value) ... so after personally developing that understanding and im now I can focus on actively practical skillset and apply them as much as possible."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Thank you Alex. Timely word!
aLp-6C-p-T0,Great channel brother. How can I get in touch with you for a 1 on 1?
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Oh, you need to tell this to every HR on the world."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Great piece of advice 👍
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Make a course about ""how to avoid course purgatory"" to make the idea more clearly."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Youtube 😭😭, how to stop taking courses"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I think course is only good for jump start when you really a beginner, acquiring the basic knowledge, and then the rest is about practice more"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"At a certain point, books are better. They go into way more detail. If you read a few of the best books on a programming language and apply it, you are well on your way to become an expert."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Watching this and getting inspired to take course on data analysis
aLp-6C-p-T0,Main idea that I took away: diversify your knowledge of how you apply what you learned in your courses. Seek ways of applying knowledge to grow your understanding and don't trap yourself to a course. Courses are not bad though and good to start out.
aLp-6C-p-T0,This video made me realise that I was doing it wrong.😱
aLp-6C-p-T0,"What about taking new courses about new skills or knowledge?

I mean I get your point regarding ""I took 8 courses on Python"" (BTW, why did you take so many of them? 😂), but I was wondering whether ""one course per new skill, and a fair amount of exercises afterwards"" was a good approach."
aLp-6C-p-T0,I feel that's a bad clickbait. This will discourage good teachers to come out with innovative methods. I learned all my coding from courses and wonder if the teacher would have ever taught if not paid. This is individual's responsibility to finish the course.
aLp-6C-p-T0,Imagine only taking courses and not practicing with what you have learned🤣
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I'm not a coder, but I do takes a lot of courses. Skillshare, Udemy, Coursera, Masterclass, Domestika, you call it.  I'm on art & design course purgatory, lol"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I hate course. Simply because it will make you lazy to do things on your own. I prefer self learning and ask people when I hit a wall. Or you can ask someone to teach you, so much better than pay a course."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"So Praxis then? Praxis =  The synthesis of theory and practice, i.e. you practice the theory of what you learnt and develop the skill. Basically, practice makes permanent. The more you do it, the better you get."
aLp-6C-p-T0,My Udemy library is starting to look like my Steam library. Lots of stuff unplayed
aLp-6C-p-T0,Shows an ad to buy a new course..
aLp-6C-p-T0,"We stil need to take courses that are neccesary. They are like tool boxes. Once we have those, we can use those in our projects. Without courses we find it difficult to start."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Any course worth it's salt will invite you to embark in a project right after it
aLp-6C-p-T0,"This is good advice. I've been quite the opposite throughout my career and that fact is one of the primary reasons I have been so successful. I'll take a course every so often, but then I immediately turn to real world experience to truly solidify the knowledge in my brain. Until you see the technology implemented top to bottom in a system that actually does something useful, it often remains an abstract concept that needs to take root. There is no teacher quite like experience."
aLp-6C-p-T0,This is happened to me now I'm trying more practical approach
aLp-6C-p-T0,Great advise thanks a lot and also great to see so many people on the path of self-improvement :D!
aLp-6C-p-T0,"It makes sense because companies that provide courses make their money... by providing courses. And the more courses you take, the more money the providers make."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Your example of For Loops hit me. I'm still not sure how they work lol
aLp-6C-p-T0,"According to Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at Stanford, THE best way to learn is to make and fix mistakes during repeated practice on a single detail under different scenarios, as many as possible, and mistakes are essential in the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills. However, ironically, taking courses basically takes all that mistake-making away from you. So it's pretty reasonable to say that taking courses is an overrated way of learning.

By the way, I highly recommend Andrew Huberman's podcast. Check it out if you're interested."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Why you need to stop posting clickbait.
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Can I go to Google Datasets, type in my name, and see everything they have on me? Asking for a friend (who works at the NSA, but don't worry about it)! ;)"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I like to take courses to learn what a language can and cannot do.
And then I do small projects to learn how to do it :)

Most of my learning time is spend on tinkering.

About scraping, as I can understand, scraping from Facebook is not permittet anymore without the expressed consent of facebook.
I talk with a guy who did a NLP project as his bachelor thesis, and he told me they had to copy paste data manually. Here we talk about comments, is there any other data they have which is still up for graps?"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I've following rules when it comes to consumption and masterting any INFORMATION:
1. Mantra: Knowing without applying is not knowing
2. Knowing is 1%, Applying 99% to achieve mastery"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Just pick a course(educator) you like, cause going through books/documentation are kinda very tough at first then try to apply it on small projects(50% different) from the ones shown in the course. Thats my go and it really helps. Educators like : NetNinja, Stephen Grider, Brad Traversy, Abdul Bari are  awesome. I think knowing the basic features and implementation is worth knowing. We need not invest hundreds of dollars on COURSERA just for certification and stuff."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Alex: Don't take too many courses
Me: Logs into Coursera and see only 1 course with 10% completion.

Me haz sad."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"This is what I've been calling a tutorial hell. I've been there. I always remind myself how I wasted like half a year on doing python over and over. I get reminded of this anytime I see some free courses on a subject on YouTube, and people being extremely positive and happy about them in the comments while they are literally just learning for loops over and over :/

Also there is a severe lack of intermediate and advanced courses that would either force you to do much harder projects or challenges or give you a lot more information on optimization of your code and deep dive into the software-hardware interactions, like memory allocation and so on."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Now where can I sign up for the full version of this course?
aLp-6C-p-T0,Only take a course when you are going to use it soon. Just-in-time learning 🙌 or apply for an exam so you’re forced to use it.
aLp-6C-p-T0,Why You Need to Stop Watching Youtube!
aLp-6C-p-T0,Can you recommend a course about quitting courses
aLp-6C-p-T0,"I completely agree. I learn by doing; however, I did learn some tricks while taking the google certificate, the best way for me to understand is by doing stuff that is part of the job."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Gee, who would have thought being a mindless idiot about something doesn't work. Paid courses aren't designed to teach you - they're designed to get you to do more courses. There's SOOOO MUCH free python stuff which is put out not to make money."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Yeah a person ""gets good by doing"". So if you are say, learning Python, you do TONS of Python coding and consult online resources when you need to know something or answer a question. There is also a talent factor ( in anything ) which will limit the results of any individual. You can't learn or buy talent, you are born with it. Things like hard work and experience simply develops the talent a person is born with it, but won't surpass it. What this means is that you can never use courses/hard work/experience to COMPENSATE your way beyond your natural talent level. That's just a fact of life. Your potential in ANY field is limited by your natural abilities in that field. You develop that max-potential mostly by doing, with the right amount of instruction/studying mixed in."
aLp-6C-p-T0,YouTube and Instagram will make you believe that anything and everything you do in your life is a mistake.
aLp-6C-p-T0,How can be possible this video shows recommended to be. 😂
aLp-6C-p-T0,You mean getting scammed by stupid “enterpernuers trying to sell a course?”
aLp-6C-p-T0,Build and end-to-end project( from live data scraping to plotting predictions on a live website) you'll learn more than any course you've taken
aLp-6C-p-T0,Most are not able to apply.
aLp-6C-p-T0,Dislikes are from udemy addicts
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Hello.
Quite an interesting advice there. 
I seem to be in a ""Wilderness"". 
Is there an email address I could reach out to?
I really would appreciate some expert advice, but don't want a plethora of suggestions to confuse me further.
Thank you!"
aLp-6C-p-T0,"To be honest, YouTube crash course and free videos and Google searches when the problem comes in real life taught me a lot rather than courses on Coursera and Udemy. Just my views but yes real life problem are best."
aLp-6C-p-T0,"Come up with a project and then learn the skills that you need to complete that project. For example, in learning python I came up with my own hangman game. There were a lot of skills I either didn't have or didn't fully understand that were necessary to complete the project, so I looked them up as I coded. Slowly I learned new things or finally understood how something worked once I was applying it to my unique situation and learning how changes affected how that code worked."
aLp-6C-p-T0,Thank you so much!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"You often say that you make videos to help people along their data analyst journey because you didn’t have many resources when you started yours. Dude, I want you to know that you are far exceeding that goal. Your videos give me (and I’m sure many others) tremendous value. I started this journey back in April and I’ve learned so much already. I seriously don’t know where I’d be without your guidance. Thank you so much!"
ocdwh0KYeUs,this may have been one of the most amazing videos I've ever watched
ocdwh0KYeUs,17:30
ocdwh0KYeUs,"I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Alex the Analyst for creating and sharing such an insightful and practical Data Analyst course. Your clear explanations, hands-on projects, and structured approach made learning data analytics both engaging and accessible.
Thank you for generously sharing your knowledge and helping aspiring analysts like me gain the skills and confidence needed to grow in this field. Your efforts truly make a difference."
ocdwh0KYeUs,"My first thought was that a 35-minute-long video would take me 2 hours max to finish, but this actually took days. I didn't even know how to upload stuff to GitHub in the first place. But I'm actually proud of how things turned out. Thank you Alex."
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank You Alex for what you are doing for the community, Please I need guideline on how to attach a powerBI and Excel project on this template, I will appreciate anyone who can give me a clue on how to get it done. 

I understood the SQL and Tableau because they've link that can be copied but how do I attach my Excel and PowerBI project?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,Just use wrap-text alex😂😂
ocdwh0KYeUs,"At the start of the video after clicking the link ,the page that I get doesn't give an option to download the files 
Any help @AlexTheAnalyst"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"this helps so much cuz most of the other apps for this use cost money, Thanks! 👍"
ocdwh0KYeUs,
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hello Alex, thank you so much for this video, it is invaluable. Please, how do I add my Power BI projects to the website? I only use Power BI desktop, and I don't have access to Power BI service."
ocdwh0KYeUs,Seriously! Thank you! Like seriously!!!!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"thank you bro, really good"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you soo much ❤.
I hope that you can do a part 2, to show how to add more Projects and sections to the portfolio"
ocdwh0KYeUs,I am not getting same design I am getting just text can anybody help me
ocdwh0KYeUs,Done with the 5th video in portfolio project series . It is really helping me to learn . I will do the remaining too . Thank you Alex
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you Alex! I learnt a lot from this video 💫
ocdwh0KYeUs,How to display plotly outputs on Github?
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hi everyone,
I developed a model using Google Colab and uploaded the project to GitHub. However, the plots I generated are not displaying correctly on GitHub. Has anyone encountered this issue or have suggestions on how to troubleshoot it?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you so much ❤
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Great video, man! Seriously, you have no idea how much this helped. I was totally breaking my head trying to figure out a portfolio, and with your tutorial, boom! Done in under an hour. Thanks!"
ocdwh0KYeUs,THANK YOU A TONNNNNE
ocdwh0KYeUs,OMG alex you made it soo so so easy. thank you very much!!!!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"How long did it take you guys for GitHub to build your website, it has been over 20 minutes so far, is this normal?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you so much
You really made the steps easy to follow"
ocdwh0KYeUs,9:45
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Watching you video ,i have been able to finally build a free portfolio website ........Yeeeeeeeeh 💃💃💃.I would tag you on linked in when am done with uploading of my projects. Thanks Alex."
ocdwh0KYeUs,"For someone who is totally a beginner, I was wondering what was happening. Apparently I have to create a github. Off, to learn how to create and use github, then I will be back to continue."
ocdwh0KYeUs,Hello Alex . Can you please tell me how to update this website ?
ocdwh0KYeUs,anyone knows how to change that weird contacs alignment?
ocdwh0KYeUs,Can we donwload this portfolio as a pdf and to put in linkedin
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Absolutely helpful videos! Thank you so much, Alex~~"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you soooo much! Github was intimidating to me before, but your tutorial is so easy to follow and concise that I finally got my first portfolio on it!"
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you for this informative video
ocdwh0KYeUs,Im not getting the correct data
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you very much for this video. It's amazes that I now have my own website through such a stress free process and ZERO PAYMENTS.
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Fantastic portfolio tutorial, Alex! 🚀 It was so clear and straightforward. I had a great time creating my own portfolio website thanks to your guidance. 🙌 Appreciate your effort, cheers! 🎉✨"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hey Alex, I appreciate so much bro, this is a lifesaver and a footstep into doing more projects, thank you :)"
ocdwh0KYeUs,16:12
ocdwh0KYeUs,How do you make changes to the website? Do you just go straight to the Github code or make changes in VScode and repost it back to Github? Sorry new to Github and HTML!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Oh shhhhhh its Alex The Developer 😅😅😅
Thanks for the video"
ocdwh0KYeUs,I just created my first website  it's crazy
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you so much it was helpful
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hi, I have a questions how can  upload a word document.  I’m a student and all my projects are on Word documents."
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Did GitHub update pages? I don't see ""GitHub pages"" as a section in the settings 😭"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Alex I love you, buddy, but a simple wordpress free template would have been more than adequate.  No coding needed, just use the editor."
ocdwh0KYeUs,Good job
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hi Alex, please I can't find the web server to download . Pleaseeeee help. Thanks"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Google Sites is a great and easy one, you can even do some HTML, like i-frames and stuff."
ocdwh0KYeUs,"I cannot believe i was able to follow through to the end and even successfully did a website, and uploaded to github, thank yu so much i am elated"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"How would I go about updating the website? Let's say I've finished a new project and want to add it, is there a better way than reuploding the new files? Tried creating local repo on GitHub desktop but any changes I make via VisualStudioCode don't seem to show up."
ocdwh0KYeUs,This is awesome thanksssss
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hello, Alex

Thanks for this video.

I'm kinda  stuck...
Linkedin icon not reflecting on life server.

What could I be doing wrong?

(I put it in lowercase)"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thanks for the very helpful video. I've created my website, but wanted to tweak a few things and have edited the code after. Do I need to delete and upload again?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"thank you so much for this, i just have a question. after creating the portfolio how do i add a completed project to the website?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"hi alex, this video was very helpful. thanks!!"
ocdwh0KYeUs,On github it's not possible to have a php website ?
ocdwh0KYeUs,You are THE best! Thank you so much.
ocdwh0KYeUs,How do you change colors on the website
ocdwh0KYeUs,"So useful, congrats!"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Truly you are astonishing and we are grateful for you super efforts 
May Allah grant you gannah and guide you into Islam 🤍"
ocdwh0KYeUs,Where can I download those images plz
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Good day Alex, am just seeing this video for the first time since the time of upload 
Am following the steps but my visual studio code doesn't have live server 
And stuck on how to open live server . please help"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you Alex. I was build my portfolio with this way. And if I want to make a change, how is it? Where I have to change? GitHub or html?
Thankyou"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hello sir, im facing domain name issue can you please help me"
ocdwh0KYeUs,The Boss
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Alex, I don't know how to thank you for this. You have no idea how much this helped me to build a portfolio and my self-confidence at the same time. Keep this up, good luck Alex!😊"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you, Alex. please can do more on Power BI project?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,how can I put my power bi project ?
ocdwh0KYeUs,"3 years later I am stuck. A non programmer,🤦can someone help"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"I am experiencing an error at the hosting part kindly help.The error is in the ""Build with jekyll"" part"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"gracias Alex, eres el mejor, Te amo :D"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you for this video,  am able to successfully create mine 🎉"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"I don't know why but when I try ""Open Folder"" to open the index.html file, I don't see the file in the first place. Is there something I am doing wrong? P.S. I have installed the correct extension"
ocdwh0KYeUs,How come I don't get a full dark screen on the website? I have Half light green and other half white. What am I doing wrong?
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you SO MUCH!!!  ❤
ocdwh0KYeUs,"31:42 I didn't get the screen like that, It didn't give me the link of the website. It's asking custom domain name for me."
ocdwh0KYeUs,I cant thank you enough for this videos. I launched my portfolio using GitHub pages. I still need to make some changes. Should I make the changes in the html and launch my portfolio again ?
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thanks for providing this tutorial Alex, it is much appreciated! I just had a question for anyone that can help. Has anyone tried updating their website after they originally published it. I made some updates on the index.html syntax on my github repository, pushed the change to the main branch but my updates haven't been changed on the website when I click the link"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Thank you so much Alex, I am so happy. It was really fun doing this and getting it perfectly as a first timer. God bless you"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Amazing stuff... explained in the easiest way possible...!!!
I prepared my first portfolio with the help of this video.... really grateful dear alex...👍"
ocdwh0KYeUs,I am trying to use my linkedin link on the @ text but it's not opening. Can anybody help me? It is showing that the editor could not open because the file was not found.
ocdwh0KYeUs,"It doesn't opt me the ""open with a server"""
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Hi Alex,

I recently watched your data analysis bootcamp and am in the process of creating a portfolio website. I noticed that you’ve only uploaded SQL and Tableau projects. Does this mean that projects related to Python and pandas (data cleaning, data exploration, etc.) are not necessary to include in our portfolios?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,Awesome! Thanks Alex for helping me out to create  my first portfolio website 🙏
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thx bro i made my first portfolio!!! With my projects
ocdwh0KYeUs,I would suggest instead of deleting what you don't use comment it out using <!-----> and if you are nesting comments use <!- - as your start and - ->
ocdwh0KYeUs,Thanks so much I just built my portfolio after months of procastination.
ocdwh0KYeUs,I m getting so much inspiration from you!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"ONCE I PUBLISHED THIS THROUGH GITHUB AFTER IF I WANT TO UPDATE SOME CHANGES THEN WHY ISN'T SHOWING UPDATED ONE .?????????????????
@ALEXTHEANALYST"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"HOW TO UPDATE THE WEB SITE WHILE SEARCHING IT SHOWING WITH NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH INDEX.HTML. 
I WANT TO CHANGE WITH PERSONAL WEB SITE

ocdwh0KYeUs,Thank you soo much for this wonderful video!! Excellently explained!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"I'm using Mac and when I download the Visual Studio Code, there is no folder in it, just the application. How could I do next?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,It says in the end that some jobs were nit successful and all i have got is blank website with the links only!
ocdwh0KYeUs,"If I make a project in Power BI, do I have to first upload to Github and then share the github link on my website? I find Github very confusing...."
ocdwh0KYeUs,"по-моему нужно брать и делать, успеешь в первый вагон - будет все огонь!"
ocdwh0KYeUs,Fantastic Alex ❤❤ I have a fear about making my own portfolio website but after watching the full video I have enough courage to make a website.
ocdwh0KYeUs,thanks sir
ocdwh0KYeUs,"I am not able to get the Pages URL for free as this option is not available in my github site , any valid reason please ?"
ocdwh0KYeUs,"Love it, was really really helpful 😊"
iPYVYBtUTyE,For anyone wondering if this still applies in 2025 (August). I am happy to report it does! I completed all four projects and made a portfolio web page for my resume and landed an analyst job in three months (this was full time job hunting as I was unemployed) Thanks Alex!
iPYVYBtUTyE,"11:30
this is the way I find the missing values: 
df.isnull().sum()

And the results are:
name           0
rating        77
genre          0
year           0
released       2
score          3
votes          3
director       0
writer         3
star           1
country        3
budget      2171
gross        189
company       17
runtime        4
dtype: int64"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hey Alex, thank you for this helpful video!"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"For those at around 40 mins mark, if you just do df_numerized = df, it assigns by reference, so instead do df_numerized = df.copy(), and this will instead copy its value keeping the original reference as it is. This will let you avoid the problem of having the df changed alongside df_numerized."
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Ah hi, I'm doing this video in 2025, and it's got completely different result, and I honestly looking at my result, following your video steps to steps and the data correlation doesn't make sense."
iPYVYBtUTyE,Completed 4th one . I will do complete the rest tooo.
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Something to note here for any future watchers. Around the 17min mark or so, Alex is correcting the year but its been some time and the original data is different so his line no longer works seamlessly. 
You can substitute his line
df['yeearcorrect'] = df['released'].astype(str)[:4]

With the following:
import re
def extract_year(text):
    match = re.search(r'\b\d{4}\b', str(text))
    return match.group() if match else None
df['yearcorrect'] = df['released'].apply(extract_year)

to achieve the same effect. The data changed from a format of ""YYYY-MM-DD"" to ""Month DD, YYYY ({Location})"" and so the regex above will search for any grouping of 4 numbers together and return that group. 

Note: Alex is incorrect in saying that the IMDB data is incorrect for these years. They just mean something different. You can confirm by checking IMDB's Help section. Essentially, ""Release Date"" refers to the public release of the film, but ""year"" refers to first ever airing and ""includes any festival release dates"". I think a more appropriate response would be to change the names of the columns to something like ""First Appearance"" and ""Public Release"" or something along those lines. I opted to not include this particular section in my portfolio project for that reason. 
https://help.imdb.com/article/contribution/titles/release-dates/GVUUDEPJNAW6G35P#

That said, Alex has made a fantastic series of videos that are phenomenally helpful and organized, mistakes here and there are human and the effort to put together this series with far than make up for any minor mistakes throughout this series."
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Even though, I barely understood the code, I used this to get the corrected year:

df['yearcorrect'] = df['released'].str.rsplit(' (', n=-1).str[0].str.split(',', n=1).str[-1]

Then I used this to convert it to a numeric value
df['yearcorrect'] = pd.to_numeric(df['yearcorrect'], errors = 'coerce').fillna(0).astype('int64')

Good luck!

PS: I downloaded the dataset on 13.03.2025 and the rows seem to have been updated. Also, we now have missing values; do check the comments on how to deal with them."
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hey Alex!
Thank you for creating such useful content.

Just so you know, at 29:00 something is wrong. :)
You put the budget on the x-axis and the gross on the y-axis. Then you labeled them incorrectly; the x-axis was labeled ""gross,"" and the y-axis was labeled ""budget."" Consequently, they were interpreted incorrectly as well."
iPYVYBtUTyE,the year was correct to me and didnot need to fix
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Need help at around 50:30 I run into an error: ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Avatar', when running: df_num.corr()
Please someone help, I've been struggling with this and ChatGPT not much help"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"#DOUBT Hello Sir, I am trying to use %matplotlib inline in vscode. But it is showing error. Can u please resolve this?"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"I think that at 17:10 they made a mistake naming 2 different columns with the same name, because one was supposed to be the “year release” while the other “year of production”. The year of production actually matches with the year of release when they start to shoot the film at the begining of the year and release it at the same year. Sometimes production starts at the end of the year so that’s why the release is the year after that. So, as a beginner and your student, is it good to directly rename that coumn so we can have some extra interesting data to work on? Sorry for my bad ensligh, but I hope that I’ve explained it well and thanks a lot for all your amazing videos: I can’t never stop to say thank to you!"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Just incase anyone has an issue with df.corr()

Since Pandas 20.0 you need to add the parameter numeric_only = True or it will give you a conversion error

Try: df.corr(numeric_only = True)"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"there are many nul values in different column but how is it showing 0? and why didn't he use isna( ) , .info( ) ?"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"35:46 if anyone is stuck like I was with the df.corr(method ='pearson') you can try this:

numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
correlation_matrix = numeric_df.corr(method='pearson')

print(correlation_matrix)"
iPYVYBtUTyE,I learnt so much from this. Thanks Alex
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Anyone getting an issue where in the correlation graph only the top row is filling out the numbers? I looked it up and to have it fill out you need to write annot = True, but still getting issues. Only the name row is filled out."
iPYVYBtUTyE,"I am wondering the x label is budget, right?  As Alex did, x=df ['budget'] and xlabel is gross earning 

# correlation exploration
# scatter plot: budget vs gross

plt.scatter(x= df_cleaned['budget'] ,y=df_cleaned['gross'])

plt.title('Relationship between Budget and Gross')

iPYVYBtUTyE,Not apostrophe. It is single quotes. Thank you for the great tutorial!

iPYVYBtUTyE,please help with marketing analyst projects
iPYVYBtUTyE,is anyone else only getting the heatmap to show only the top rows numeric values while everything under is just colored?
iPYVYBtUTyE,Thanks in advance
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hi Alex, great job you are doing in your channel, thank you very much. I just wanted to say, if it might help anybody who is watching you  (because I believe that you already know it after two years), that a correlation measures the reaction of one value against the movement of another value. For this, both values need to be able to move and get bigger or smaller, something that letters (and names, in consequence) cannot do, neither can letters or names disguised as numbers, because those are static too, hence, the ""non numeric"" correlations showed in the video, are false. 

This problem could just be a mess up in any project, but, in a project that is our portfolio, our showroom, it will only show how much of a data analyst we are NOT. 

Kindly study a work around to this statistical problem, which is not to change letters by numbers. So many great developers behind Pandas would have implemented it many years ago. 😀"
iPYVYBtUTyE,ty
iPYVYBtUTyE,Looks like there's been a mix-up with the axis labels on the graph. The 'budget' and 'revenue' labels are swapped. The 'budget' should actually be labeled as 'revenue' (250 million) and vice versa for the 'revenue' (a billion).  Thanks!
iPYVYBtUTyE,"The seaborn correlation heatmap only shows annotations for first row, has anyone worked out a fix?"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Had countless issues with extracting the release year.

iPYVYBtUTyE,is it ok to do this project on kaggle instead of Jupyter?
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hi Alex,  I have moved onto this project and when I downloaded the CSV file it contained lots of NaN's

I managed to fix these myself with the following and thought you and the subscribers would be interested how I did it:
df.isnull().sum()
# Replacing the NaN values in the score column with the mean of the column
# df[""score""].unique()
# df[""score""].mean()

mean_s = df[""score""].mean()
print(mean_s)
df[""score""].fillna(mean_s, inplace = True)

#Replacing NaN values with in the mean of the votes column
# df[""votes""].unique()

mean_v = df[""votes""].mean()
# print(mean_v)
mean_v = df[""votes""].mean()
# print(mean_v)
df[""votes""].fillna(mean_v, inplace = True)

#Replacing NaN values it the Writer Column
df[""writer""].unique()
df[""writer""].fillna(""Unknown Writer"", inplace = True)

#Replacing NaN values in the Star Column

df[""star""].unique()

df[""star""].unique()
df[""star""].fillna(""Unknown Star"", inplace = True)

#Replacing NaN values in the Country column
# df[""country""].unique()

df[""country""].unique()
df[""country""].fillna(""Unknown Country"", inplace = True)

#Replacing NaN values in the budget column with the mean of the column
mean_b = df[""budget""].mean()
print(mean_b)
df[""budget""].fillna(mean_b, inplace = True)

Similar Strategies were used for the Gross, Company, Runtime

I also split the ""released column"" to release_date and Release_Country and changed the date from object to Date_time format

#Splitting the Released Column into Date_Released and Country_Released
# df[""released""].unique()

df[[""release_date"", ""release_country""]] = df[""released""].str.split(""("", expand = True)

df[""release_date""] = pd.to_datetime(df[""release_date""], format= ""%B %d, %Y"", infer_datetime_format = True)"

iPYVYBtUTyE,"The csv data looks very different two years later. 😅The year format has changed from ""YYYY-MM-DD"" to ""Month Day, Year (country released in)"" so I had difficulty extracting the year from the string...

iPYVYBtUTyE,@32:56 into the video. You were looking for the words:  curly brackets.
iPYVYBtUTyE,"55:00 THAT is extremely important, because it was so FAT (that is weighted so much MB) I couldn't even re-open it on jupyter notebook, had to start all over, minimizing the entire looking into df commands, and in general making it weigh WAY WAY less than what it weighted in the first version. If anyone has any questions about errors that may occur due to TIME PASSING (over 2 years now, data got updated, jupyter notebook got updated, python got updated etc.) You may ask here."
iPYVYBtUTyE,Thank you so much for your Video those help me a lot and finally I got a job as Data engineer by no experience  in this role but I had learn from your channel in 1 moth! I got a lot of knowledge. really appreciated your support. thank you very very much!

iPYVYBtUTyE,"About the Convertion from float64 to int64, I did the following:

# Replace non-finite values with 0 before converting to int64

# Convert the 'gross' from float64 to int64

iPYVYBtUTyE,@Alextheanalyst  hi Alex. Would you be able to please update this video ? The dataset you used has changed a bit. I'm unable to figure out the part where you separate the date. You slice the released column by using (:4) which is the first 4 letters as year is in the front but now it's month first in the released column and I'm not sure how to slice the data as each month is  varying in length. Any pointers?
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Is it ok to add this project to my portfolio, would It be valid ?. Of course after understanding it. Or do I have to make my own analysis of a dataset, and if so, what questions should I ask myself in order to analyze a completely new dataset to me?"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hello, 
I tried to read the movies.csv file, but it seems impossible, I couldn't to display it, I had this kind of error: .CParserError: Error tokenizing data 

Anyone could help on that ? 
thanks in advance"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Alex, when I run the sort_values, it throws Avatar, Titanic, and Avengers: Endgame in to a negative gross. How do I fix this? I don't want to drop the whole column, leaving the negatives skews the data. 

update: I got it fixed. But now when I am trying to do the correlation matrix, I get  valueerror stating could not covert string to a float 'The Shinning'. I am not sure what this means."
iPYVYBtUTyE,"5:20 Faster way to do this is to shift right-click the file and copy as path.

The ""apostrophes"" are just called single quotes"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"Hi alex, please share the data set you used as the one on kaggle has updated"
iPYVYBtUTyE,Hi I can't see plotly graphs in GitHub any solution?
iPYVYBtUTyE,"The 'released' column is updated, now it comes with a text format date and the country of release. What I did was to split the column in two : Release date and Country release. 
The code I used was this:
df[['released','country_release']] = df['released'].str.split(' \(',n=1,expand=True) 

Then you have to clean a littile bit the 'country_release' column with:
df['country_release'] = df['country_release'].str.replace(')','')

And finally give the 'released' column the datetime format with this:
df['released'] = pd.to_datetime(df['released'],format='mixed')

For some reason using format = 'mixed' did the magic trick for me, i tried '%B %d, %Y' but It never worked."
iPYVYBtUTyE,"alternative for identifying missing data: 
df.info()
df.isnull().sum() # count of missing values
df.isnull().mean() # proportion

extract yearcorrect from updated data:
df['released_date'] = df['released'].str.split(""("", expand=True)[0].str.strip() # split released column
df['released_year'] = df['released_date'].astype(str).str[-4:].astype(int)"

Hello. The Year Column solution given below wasn't working for me. It was showing the ""cannot convert float NaN to integer"" error - which you can search to understand in details. 
So, I had to use the Chat Gpt. The Code which worked for me in the given order is below - 

1) # Check for missing values:
print(df['released'].isnull().sum())

2) # Drop rows with missing values:
df = df.dropna(subset=['released'])

3) # Alternatively, fill missing values with a specific value:
df['released'] = df['released'].fillna('Unknown')

4) # Convert column to numeric type and handle non-numeric values:
df['yearcorrect'] = pd.to_numeric(df['released'].str.extract(pat='([0-9]{4})')[0], errors='coerce')

5) # Now, we can create Correct Year Column:
df['yearcorrect'] = df['released'].str.extract(pat = '([0-9]{4})').astype(int)
df"
iPYVYBtUTyE,"started doing the project and noticed Kaggle data slightly different from one in the video. there were some negative numbers in the gross column. to change that to positive had to run this code # apply conditional function to the column containing negative numbers
df['gross'] = df['gross'].apply(lambda x: abs(x) if x < 0 else x)"
iPYVYBtUTyE,Thank you Alex for making this project free. I am making a career change and pretty new to this field. I am wondering if this level of project is sufficient for a entry level position yet or does it need to trickier? I hope that it is enough for us to start applying jobs. Thanks a ton.
iPYVYBtUTyE,I don't know if I see the point of this video unless you already have a good base in Python. Anyone who doesn't know enough Python to actually recreate MOST of this without a video is just going through the motions and arguably not learning anything of value.
iPYVYBtUTyE,"to whom ever noticed that the 'released' column we have is not in the same format that Alex have and getting errors because of that; 15:27 
i've been where you were, it took me 4 days just to figure this out, here is the line of code you need:

dMHWOhgzUhU,Holy flippin shyt I needed to find this guy
dMHWOhgzUhU,"Love your direct delivery!! I’m a little confused in these first few minutes. You mention SQL, Python, Tableau etc. Did you have these skills when you found your position as a data analyst or have times changed and we need this before we look? 

I thought this video was for people without experience. Why would a Baseball coach   
 let’s say, already have the skills you mention? 

I’m not challenging you in anyway. I’m trying to truly figure out if non techies have cause to have python, Tableau etc knowledge and if I’ve been left behind because I haven’t been using these tools at all. 😂😂👍 Thank you"
dMHWOhgzUhU,"SO i got my account locked on linkdin for no apparent reason? i gave them a selfie and my drivers license and there garbage ai auto declined it, so its safe to say that linkdin is no longer a platform that is usable for newbies."
dMHWOhgzUhU,"Hi Alex,

This video has been incredibly helpful! As someone without a college degree, I’ve been fortunate to build a career in tech sales (self-taught). However, I’m currently in the process of changing my career path, which is why I came across your channel to learn how to become a Data Analyst.

My true passion is cybersecurity, but I know breaking into that field is a journey that takes time. So, I started researching the fastest-growing tech jobs for 2025, and Data Analyst stood out as a field expected to grow significantly through 2033.

If I could give any advice, it would be this: Keep going your time will come! But you have to be willing to put in the work and make sacrifices.

I just enrolled in Coursera’s Data Analyst course today, so we’ll see how far I can go from here. Wishing everyone pursuing a career in tech or data analytics much success you got this! 💪"
dMHWOhgzUhU,"To me and future data analyst, probably what you are looking for is how do you place or frame yourself as someone who is ready for the role, especially coming from non it formal education, customer service or other non it role, you old, etc, but all you have are EXTENSICE years of experienc doing non related work.

Alex tell you to: 

1- Put whatever related to Data work on the top
2- What data related work you ask? Well, since you have no experience, then portfolio and certs are your only game changer, cause why you ask next? TA or Rec dont waste their time listening to our sob transitioning stories. So dont waste any opportunity 
3- What will happen is that they will be drawn to the skills you acquired and how you apply. Skills you ask? Sql excel power bi, some related tools like ERH etc if you are into it. Apply? Thru projects, esp with real data sets answering real business concern. 
4- LinkedIn: Best place so far ; optimize your profile by making your profile open to work, and choose data analyst or data-related role as your role. Why this platform you ask? Cause you NEED THE HELP OF THE RECRUITOR instead of blind apply on other platforms. You want the TA to find you and vice versa. Also, connect to recruitors. It doesnt kill you. Rec will ask where you are in the stage, and find you the most suitable role you can apply, or the most suitable company
5- Technical interview ; Test skills 

Ok thats all i guess. I hope this is still relevant in 2025 (march 18th)"

dMHWOhgzUhU,"Hi Alex, I’m making a career switch to data analyst and I’m highly interested in a digital marketing analyst role. However, besides being familiar with social media and having the data analyst skills you’ve shared, I can’t seem to find anymore info. Is that it, or should I be looking for a particular certificate/ course?"
dMHWOhgzUhU,"Check out our latest big data video, https://youtu.be/icGopl3KLZw"

Or how do you live on less than 6? Is it something other than genetics?"
A-LkxegXFX8,"Zucchini!! Thank you guys for making another video together :) I am going through two major life changes, attempting to change my career & ending a relationship of 5 years. I've been down in the dumps & discouraged, but your vodeos make me feel hopeful & optimistic for the future :) I'm currently a mechanic at a GM dealership, study part time at DSU, & hope to switch to data analytics quickly. Somewhere down the line, I also hope to find a partner that makes me as happy as you guys!"

A-LkxegXFX8,"Alex, on a previous episode with your wife she mentioned you have an interest in watches. What's typically on your wrist?"
A-LkxegXFX8,Hello Alex. Do you have time for private life while doing your job?Maybe i am on a hard mission because i teach english while learning for Data Analyst.But i dont have money to only learn for Data Analyst so i am forced to. Which rhythm of learning would you recommend me?
A-LkxegXFX8,Nice. Zucchini. Christine would be great on her own channel. :)

A-LkxegXFX8,Does  a data analyst from the Middle East have a chance to get a work from home job in US company?
A-LkxegXFX8,"Zucchini...and our 3 year old granddaughter is a GINGER....with all of the stereotypical behavior.  :)

I don't know where you are in TX, but a former pastor from our church here moved there to work for Compass, and he's the pastor for their new campus in North Fort Worth."

I really like it man 🌺🙂
We are waiting for the next one 🔥
Zucchini 🙏"
A-LkxegXFX8,a whole lot of zucchini. lets prep  salads.
A-LkxegXFX8,No brussels sprouts(Taken) zucchini! Love seeing you too.
A-LkxegXFX8,"Hi Alex, thank you for sharing your knowledge with us.  I am trying to do what you do and break into the Data Analyst field and I am in my 30s.  I have a BA in Economics and am considering pursuing a MSBA at Baruch in NY.  Are these degrees worth it?  Baruch is cheap relative to other schools and I can probably graduate debt free.  Thoughts?"
A-LkxegXFX8,Beautiful Family. Alex the Budget Man. Christine the Counsellor. zucchini?
A-LkxegXFX8,"Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Alex The Analyst. For those of us who are family-oriented i.e. married with toddlers, this episode is/was really relatable. My own sugar is a graduate student and I am seriously thinking of pivoting to DA/DS. I have a very strong quant background - BS Physics with heavy Maths, you know Maths is the language of Physicists and MS Geoscience with GIS and Hydrological Science/Water Resources). But my path has taken me to an industry where I do not think my research-oriented and analysis/analytic persona is being utilized maximally. I got into the field in question after trying to get a job, unsuccessfully thus far, in my MS field. I have invested time and energy in GIS Analysis (analysis of geographical data - wanna do a video on that kind of dataset 🙂?). DA seems to be what I have been doing for long but without using the fancy, industry-needed tools such as Python, R, PowerBI, or Tableau to mention a few.

That said, @Alex The Analyst, your recent post on LinkedIn wrt getting a DA job requiring 30% technical skills and 70% perseverance is ....(do not know what to say).

As a person who pivoted and has been in the data industry as a recruiter and practitioner, what would you advise/suggest to (I love blunt feedback) someone who is strongly considering pivoting into DA or DS at almost 4 decades old?

By the way, you have a beautiful and I believe supportive wife. And your beard is brown in my humble opinion😜.

Let me now go and look for Episode 1 with your wife..."
A-LkxegXFX8,"Hi Alex. Can you take interview from the guy who get a da job. How he prepared, what his portfolio/resume, what tools he knows, his background... 
and  another thing- now you own your wife good dinner dish,) not only morning eggs 🍳 😊 you can make 😊"
A-LkxegXFX8,"Zucchini! This episode is so great!  Thank you both! 

I recently (finally) decided to quit my job and start working hard to become a data analyst. I am a product manager in hardware field, but I have an undergrad degree in biotech and I really want to return to this field (as data analyst hopefully) !
I have been saving money for this, but I am still very nervous from time to time about this big decision I made... This episode helped me a lot, so thank you! I just completed the Python entry course last month and started taking Google certification courses on Coursera. I have been watching your videos and found it helpful, it inspires me to follow what I think is best for me, thank you Alex!"
A-LkxegXFX8,"I'm a data analyst for a large health insurance company and I work with lots of mental health professionals like counselors, therapists, social workers and psychologists.    I feel that for the amount of education they have to obtain to work and the importance of their job, they are underpaid much like teachers.  Does she feel the same or is this just my misperception?"
A-LkxegXFX8,Zucchini! Thank you guys for all the love this episode ❤️ y'all make a great team! And thank you for such great answers to my questions they were very helpful. I'm going to keep all of y'alls advice in mind 🙏
A-LkxegXFX8,zuci kainni
A-LkxegXFX8,Nice one! Zucchini!
A-LkxegXFX8,"Zucchini

I just remembered that we were growing zucchini in a small village in the middle of Turkey  and the meal with zucchini flowers and some yogurt was perfect for summertime:)"
A-LkxegXFX8,"I appreciate a good zucchini. Fantastic to meet your wife and hear some interesting stories and facts. It seems like you both have a solid foundation in communication, love, and respect."
A-LkxegXFX8,"Red beard, brown hair here! Your beard’s red my friend. Lol grow it out a bit more and you’ll see! Especially when the sun hits it."
A-LkxegXFX8,My wife make the best zucchini tarts! How can someone get to be your mentee?
A-LkxegXFX8,"Zucchini! And yes, Alex, your beard totally looks brown to me.
I also didn't mean ginger as anything offensive btw ^^;

P.S. Apparently, men can't see colour and the person calling it red also feels very validated now :D"
A-LkxegXFX8,Zucchini! Loved the episode. I found it to be quite refreshing.
A-LkxegXFX8,"Zucchini
 My best friend has brown hair and a red beard and he has a red head daughter, one of my god-babies."
A-LkxegXFX8,"Going to the library and bookstore isn't ordinary, in today's society, it is extraordinary. Give credit where it is due."
A-LkxegXFX8,Zucchini. This was a great episode to get to know you and your family better 🙂
A-LkxegXFX8,"Alex: ""...like the show Dexter...""

Me: Dexter from Dexter's laboratory did not have a beard

RJw-GSXXguA,Can you do Power BI on a Mac?
RJw-GSXXguA,Maven courses are outdated plus they are sort of refreshers to those who are already into power bi with experience. As a new career developer maven courses will not help much and one ends up seeking more courses.
RJw-GSXXguA,How about Qlik?
RJw-GSXXguA,Jalapenos!
RJw-GSXXguA,Thx so much for this video!
RJw-GSXXguA,Thanks I just signed up for the Udemy Power BI Course you recommended. Lucky for me my employer has a Udemy for Business Subscription!
RJw-GSXXguA,Can you please suggest some sites where I can do tableau projects?
RJw-GSXXguA,"Alex  the course you recommended on Tableau was a complete waste of time and money, really please dont mislead people, that course was a complete waste of time."
RJw-GSXXguA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H84UJn1CiWo&list=PL6Omre3duO-OGTAMuFuDOS8wMuuxmyaiX
RJw-GSXXguA,Does Kirill Eremenko Power BI and Tableau courses provide the resource datasets for learn?
RJw-GSXXguA,Which one was the course for tableau projects ?
RJw-GSXXguA,"Qlik Sense is my favorite BI platform, period."
RJw-GSXXguA,Udemy is free to me through my library system. Check and see if it’s available with your library card.
RJw-GSXXguA,which one is best for data analyst power bi or tableau?
RJw-GSXXguA,"The course  power bi is 119 , the first time I opened it it was 23, iw was minutes ,  I dont Know what happened"
RJw-GSXXguA,any coupon code for the power BI course?
RJw-GSXXguA,ive never heard of udemy before but this looks amazing
RJw-GSXXguA,"Hi Alex,  I have a question about matching identical values in two columns using Tableau. 
I have two columns with unique and duplicate numbers.

How do I match the numbers in one column that is identical in another column?

Column A     Column B
10002345    23456788
10045678    10002345
80123444    43456822
23456788    23145589
76673822    10045678

Do I use REGEXP_MATCH and if so what will be the formula given my sample data above?

OR can you provide an answer to my data sample above.

Thanks."
RJw-GSXXguA,What do you got against Qlik Sense Alex...!!?!!  haha just kidding.
RJw-GSXXguA,"Thanks Alex. I got the Tableau and PowerBI you recommended. The fun question will be, is it money back guaranteed :) ?"
RJw-GSXXguA,Great video!
RJw-GSXXguA,What motivates you to be a YouTuber when you already have a successful career as a data analyst?
RJw-GSXXguA,"Hy,
what about freelance data Analysis in upwork..
If ur experience in freelance..
Waiting for freelance series..😍"
RJw-GSXXguA,"Hi Alex. Could you please suggest data analytics course for finance/accounting professional, and where to start?"
RJw-GSXXguA,I did not know you are in DFW. I used to live in Plano and Frisco until last year before I got furloughed and had to move to another state for a new assignment. I am currently taking Google Data Analytics Certificate course. I still have hopes of going back to DFW. I am looking forward to catching up with you if and when I am there.
RJw-GSXXguA,@alex what's the course name you mentioned at 5:45?
RJw-GSXXguA,"Iv done numerous courses thru @mavenanalytics, they really are innovative and intelligent."
RJw-GSXXguA,Sir job related vedio please
RJw-GSXXguA,I’ll def look into these to get here certifications to have a foundation to stand on. Well as part of it. SQL is definitely a first for me.  Any others?. Would python be a great tool to learn and get a certificate as well?
RJw-GSXXguA,All of Maven's courses (Up and Running with both Power BI and Power BI services) plus the advanced DAX are pure gold. If you cover them start to finish you will be able to create meaningful and complex reports.
RJw-GSXXguA,If you complete these courses would you add them to your resume?
RJw-GSXXguA,"Hi Alex, absolutely love your channel. One question which of the Microsoft power data analyst associate or tableau desktop certification do you prefer?"
RJw-GSXXguA,I like when people get mad at you lol.
RJw-GSXXguA,What was the course that has Tableau projects? Can someone please suggest any such type of courses... Thank you
RJw-GSXXguA,Good  one from Kirill and Chris Dutton. They are masters of BI tools
RJw-GSXXguA,"Hi Alex, You are doing a great job by adding Data analytics projects, Thank you. And regarding Tableau, right now I am doing a Tableau course (  Tableau Fundamentals Skill Track) in Datacamp and it is way better than I expected. A lot of hands-on Tableau exercises and case studies are covered. At the end of each topic, you will be given a problem statement and expected to solve this by using Tableau, this technique is unique and interesting compared to the tutorial video followed by making a chart. When you have time, please check this out and review it. 

P.S. I have already finished the Krill Eremenko Tableau courses at Udemy and liked them. But Datacamp course is even better."
RJw-GSXXguA,"Good Video Alex as usual! I started taking the google analytics course a few weeks back and I’m half way through 😅.  I believe you stated there was another way of keeping in touch, I’m assuming that’s the Patreon link? Not even sure what that is.  I’m looking to begin job hunting in September. 🛫"
RJw-GSXXguA,When next part will come in portfolio projects??
RJw-GSXXguA,Dan We's Power BI courses are very good because he clearly explains DAX without which Power BI can't be used to its full potential. He seems to be quite an underrated teacher on Udemy.
RJw-GSXXguA,"Does Tableau public work for the course, or needed a paid version, thanks"
RJw-GSXXguA,@ Alex The Analyst - Could you please mention the course which you have pointed at 5:42 in the video some course related to tableau projects.. Could you please let me know what course it is?? Waiting for your response sir 🙏
RJw-GSXXguA,@Alex - Whats the course you are mentioning at time frame 5:42 something like for projects on Tableau. Could you please let me know what course it is?
RJw-GSXXguA,"Currently taking the Power BI course. Still half way, but learn a lot from it."
RJw-GSXXguA,"Power BI with no DAX is like going on holiday and not leaving the airport. Tableau has alot more limitations in data modelling. Data blending sucks and is a shadow of a real relationship. Tableau requires alot more hacks and has less expandibility. If you are just using to show so data without any modelling then both are equal, any more interesting and you start hitting walls."
RJw-GSXXguA,What do you think about the 365 Careers Data Analysis course?
RJw-GSXXguA,Please come in for a q&a session soon Alex.
RJw-GSXXguA,Part 4 coming out this week?
RJw-GSXXguA,Which tool has more job aspects in the market?
RJw-GSXXguA,Great courses! Kirill Eremenko and Maven Analytics. Some pretty heavy hitters there!
RJw-GSXXguA,I'm the first ha!  Hi Alex. What about the edx course of Davidson College? Thx for your videos.
8rO7ztF4NtU,"Had an issue with CHARINDEX on my end but used LOCATE instead to seperate the addresses, may work for you guys as well."
8rO7ztF4NtU,For anyone wondering if this still applies in 2025 (August). I am happy to report it does! I completed all four projects and made a portfolio web page for my resume and landed an analyst job in three months (this was full time job hunting as I was unemployed) Thanks Alex!

8rO7ztF4NtU,"Please I have been following your work and on getting to this video, I noticed that all the data set on your github have already been cleaned, and even the ones on the kaggle website is not thw same one that you are using, please can you re upload the original raw data set.thank you"

Here is my question: After the data cleaning, there are still some rows that have missing data (NULL). What is the best way to deal with this?

8rO7ztF4NtU,I  completed this project following your video. I used  PostgreSQL and I was able to put to use some of the concepts that I learned earlier all due to this project. Also I learnt equivalent commands that can be used in posgresql . And every part of this project helped me learn more. Thank You for guiding during the entire project. It really helps boost my confidence whenever I can complete a project or run a query successfully. Thank You.

8rO7ztF4NtU,the data set you provided in git hub is not download how can i get that data set from your github
8rO7ztF4NtU,"Thanks Alex for this amazing video. Would you mind to explain why the number of data with ""Property Address Is null"" is 29  (query executed in minutes 12:05 ) is different from the number of query executed using JOIN in minutes 17:03 (35 rows)? I have tried using Inner join and left outer join and the result is the same (35 rows). I believe that the number of query executed using JOIN should be 29 rows. Thank you very much Alex."

8rO7ztF4NtU,Again a great video Alex. Thanks for Sharing!!
8rO7ztF4NtU,i know this is an sql cleaning video but i am wondering if you clean with excel and later import into the database is that also good

8rO7ztF4NtU,Greeeeat bro ♥♥
8rO7ztF4NtU,"I just finished this project, and updated my GitHub with it and the previous one. Learning is so easy with you, you can't imagine how grateful I am that you worked so hard to put this together to help so many people! I can't wait to learn even more with the rest of the bootcamp, practice a lot and hopefully land my first DA job. Forever thankful to you 😊"
8rO7ztF4NtU,"Hello, does anyone knows why are two sets of data in the GitHub repo? Does it matter which one I use? I picked the reuploaded one but I see differences between the one he is using in the video. Thank you!!!!"

8rO7ztF4NtU,The excel file that I downloaded is showing a different language on wizard > preview. What could be the issue?

8rO7ztF4NtU,thank you so much for all the hard work you put in. I did the google coursera certification course and found i hadnt absorbed any of the information in a useful way. I followed along for just TWO of your sql basic videos and theyve helped me retain so much more information and practical uses. You really give so much to this channel and your subscribers and we really appreciate it.
8rO7ztF4NtU,I don’t know if you still read these types of comments but I just wanted to thank you Alex for this guide. You’re a really good teacher and I’m glad I found this playlist and this channel
8rO7ztF4NtU,can someone please explain what happened at 18:19 ?
8rO7ztF4NtU,"Alex, thank you very much for your dedication. I truly learned a lot from the videos you uploaded. Regarding the data cleaning in SQL, I think it would be easier to upload the data file to Power Query in Excel and perform it easily."
8rO7ztF4NtU,how to download sql sever import wizard m still having trouble ???
8rO7ztF4NtU,"Best Project Yet - Really found this one helpful, since most tutorials don't really cover a complete data cleaning process, just parts of it. Thanks Alex!"

8rO7ztF4NtU,I used to work for Microsoft as a data analyst. All the projects you did here were given to me at different times. Well done. everybody starting from scratch needs to follow you. I didn't have any idea when I started ETL/SQL jobs. This is very good one and you  keep this up.👍👍
8rO7ztF4NtU,Amazing one

QILNlRvJlfQ,"Did anyone here get a result of 2.14 billion total covid-19 cases?😢

Because I'm having unusually large values from my queries.

Sorted it out. Went to bigquery. i think my problem was the way I created the tables."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hi Alex, I am really appreciated you posted the data analyst portfolio project and I learned important concepts. Here I found one thing might be error from this portfolio regarding looking total cases versus population instead of DeathPercentage it should be CovidCasesPercetage because we are comparing total number of covid cases from population(total-cases/population)*100 AS CovidCasePercentage)."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hey Alex! Thanks for the vid! Not sure if you keep up with comments but just in case (or if someone else wants to reply)...

Whenever I try to execute the SQL codes on MySQL, it keeps telling me that the ""as int"" part is not the correct syntax. Do you know why that is happening and how to solve it?

I also tried it on SQL Server Management but it was now telling me ""Invalid object name 'PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths'.""."
QILNlRvJlfQ,Amazing video! The part where you mentioned you didn't take 1 and 1/2 hrs to make the whole dashboard is encouraging to hear as a beginner. You really demystified the whole process of being a data analyst. Thank you Alex!
QILNlRvJlfQ,@38:21 United states just unfortunately doing well.... 😀
QILNlRvJlfQ,Thank you so much Alex! I've learnt so much from you and have upgraded my knowledge on Data analysis. Hoping to get a job on it soon🤞
QILNlRvJlfQ,You can use python to automatically create a csv file for each of those sql views.

QILNlRvJlfQ,"In tableu I add several measures to columns
when I select text table, I see just measure names, not their values. while in the tutorial it shows the values.
How can I add values? I do exactly as in the tutorial

I should say that in my table in the data section, I have dimensions and measures section, but in the tutorial it has a Table section"
QILNlRvJlfQ,:)
QILNlRvJlfQ,Thank you so much for saying how long it took you to analyze this .Made me feel so much better .
QILNlRvJlfQ,"You have great Excel videos, which are really helpful. But for Tableau, give me that feeling you are not very confident, your clear explanation can make it up some, but I still hope you'll have same as Excel level Tableau courses in the future. Thanks!"

QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thank you so much for such amazing tutorial , thanks aloot Alex Sir"
QILNlRvJlfQ,Amazing tutorial alex...
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hey Alex, not certain if you'll see this at all, firstly your videos are  really helpful. Secondly during each one of your tutorials you use MS Sql Server,  is there a significant difference to MySQL ( if you have tried it) or do you have a particular reason for usng it?"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Liked, Subscribe and thankful for this super useful tutorial."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"With your brilliant tutorial, I was able to complete my first project in Tableau. Surely would make some more. You made it so fascinating. I loved every part of the video. Learned so much. Truly now more motivated to become a Data Analyst. Thank YOU  ALEX."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"hey can some one help me out when i run the 2nd query iam getting 4 extra rows ( high income , low income,middle income etcc...) can some one tell me why ."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hi Alex
You are such a blessing and a great teacher 
Thanks so much for all you do…
I have learned a lot"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thanks for this Alex.  I sincerely appreciate your efforts in helping us out with these tutorials.  Whether we use them in our portfolio, or not, there's plenty to learn about the use of Tableau.  I also appreciate your explanations on why cleaning the data is so important.  I know that creating the visualizations takes time,  plus the added time to create these videos, so thank you for your efforts.  I've gained much confidence in how to apply the basic data analysis tools through your tutorials."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hi Alex and Folks, I have the following question that I don't seem to understand, Why are we summing up total cases in the cumulative Total_cases column, which already displays the total cases and population as of the last date, 4/30/2021?  Why sum all total cases when the last date already represents the cumulative count for each country?"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thank you so much, Alex
This is truly amazing."

QILNlRvJlfQ,Can you do this in powerbi?
QILNlRvJlfQ,my map is not showing colors and isn't showing 'SUM' function with infected population percent after dragging as well. Someone please tell me what i missed.
QILNlRvJlfQ,"You were wondering if you were going to fast. One, I've never used Tableau and was able to follow, and it looks great. Two, it's on YouTube, and we can rewind/rewatch whatever we want. Great job, and the fact that you're doing this for free is mind blowing! Congrats and thank you!"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Absolutely enjoyed digging into this project with you, Alex. You're so funny! I'm pretty sure you have a future in comedy if this Data Analysis stuff doesn't work out :D"
QILNlRvJlfQ,Such a helpful video! Thanks so much Alex!!!
QILNlRvJlfQ,"I was able to writte ""continent"" every time no problem... Now I have to double check xD

Thank you so much!! I followed this 2 episodes and hopefully some recruiter will find them interesting.
Onward to the 3º"
QILNlRvJlfQ,Thank you ALEX for the sharing your knowledge and skills. I aspire to be a proficient data analyst in the coming days.
QILNlRvJlfQ,One important issue is that the prediction is wrong. The infection in the population can not be less than what it is and is always accending. The question is can Tableu provide a prediction for the accending plots?
QILNlRvJlfQ,SO AMAZING THANK YOU G£
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Dear Alex, you nailed it! 
Thanks a lot for this help and for trying your best on sharing you knowledge with us.
God bless you, man!"
QILNlRvJlfQ,Alex please share the dataset link..

QILNlRvJlfQ,"Tableau is complex smthing, Power BI is simpler and more approachable"
QILNlRvJlfQ,division by zero error
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thank God MySQL Workbench has an export to CSV function heh

To mitigate the horribly, unbelievably, absolutely insanely import speed, I used CSVLint, a Notepad++ plugin, to make a sql script for infile loading of the dataset, making it super fast like it was for you. Because since before I saw how yours imported the data in 15 seconds I thought it would always be this slow.

Also, would you recommend putting jokes in the description? I just found out that all the databases I messed with culminated into 75GB, so I mentioned it in the description"
QILNlRvJlfQ,I am a new fan. Thank you so much Sir!
QILNlRvJlfQ,"A tip for Mac users - setup a PosgreSQL with a DBeaver. Easy to setup, easy to use and you can export the data as csv files (and other formats ofc..), no need for excel, no need to replace null with 0 manually, you can configure this while exporting the csv. 
Just overall much more intuitive and light to use."
QILNlRvJlfQ,42:05 Filter.
QILNlRvJlfQ,From the start of the video where it shows the sql queries - to get the data how did you get on to that page

QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hey Alex, Just finished my second iteration working through this excellent project/video.  Made WAY more sense this time around.  Thanks again for all of your time and effort put into your creations.  Cheers!😎"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hi Alex, this was super helpful! I learned so much about Tableau and it gave.             Me confidence to create my own dashboards. 👌"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"As a starting point, this was really helpful. From here we grow and improve what we have been able to build👏"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"I'm the ""One Guy"" that was disappointed it wasn't a three-hour tutorial"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thanks Sir just completed project now, project 1 took me 3 days then this one project 2 took me a day going to project 3 now, my question is tableu public is it different from the original tableu the paid version or?

QILNlRvJlfQ,This is awesome and absolutely well explained - thank you👏👏
QILNlRvJlfQ,"I love this kind of videos! 
You have mentioned that you wouldn't like to make a 3-4 hours long, extended video. For beginners would't be useful, I understand.
Nevertheless, personally I would like to see those kind of videos especially regard to SQL. I think from a detailed video I would understand much deeply the details, and lift my knowledge to another level.
Thank you, Alex!!"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Great Alex, thanks. After this one i'm going to the Tableu Tutorial"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thanks Alex, great content and I'm finding it really useful to get hands on experience as I get to the end of my Google course."
QILNlRvJlfQ,I'm greatly convinced anyone can learn anything with the right tools. Alex you are super engaging make everything easy and fun! Thank you!
QILNlRvJlfQ,Thanks for your guidance. it was so helpful to build new concepts in visualizations
QILNlRvJlfQ,"I have mysql workbench on a macBook, and i had trouble inserting the data from the vaccinations table into mysql workbench. now, since i dont have all the data, some of the queries dont work for me if I wanna look stuff in the vaccinations table. can we access the excel documents you created for each query so i can use them for tableau? thank you"
QILNlRvJlfQ,Why is this one not in the playlist? Weeding out students who won't go find it? LOL!

QILNlRvJlfQ,How to share Tableau Visualization in Github?
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Alex, my dear Hero. Thanks so much for assisting me to overcome  a major hurdle. I am very grateful and can't thank you enough this excellent Video.  Pls trust, I'll make you very proud as I promise to go places in Visualization world with Tableau."
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hello Alex! 
One more step is done, project is completed!  
First of all, Alex, Thank you so much for your courses and your time spent on it. Personally for me, your educational materials appeal to me much more than other sources I use for my education. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you :))) 
Just let you know, it is especially intriguing when I am working on data with approximately 2 years gap from your video and I see how much the picture is different from 2021 in the term of data. I also was curious to compare the forecast made in 2021 concerning further infection rate according to an analytical tool in Tableau, and my observation is that the projection was a little bit overestimated compared to what Globe has nowadays. 
I am going further to your course! Thanks Much!
Best regards, Andrei"
QILNlRvJlfQ,Question I have- where you find the other Excel workbooks data extracted from your SQL's?  did not see those specific Excel files in github.  Only saw 2 Excel files in github
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Just GREAT GREAT GREAT stuff, sir!!!!    If as you mentioned at the beginning of this vid, one of your tutorial turns out to be 3 hrs+, by all means keep it HOWEVER you may want to publish it in a series of say, 3-4 series videos instead.   And that way folks can do it also in chunks and folks can continue learning from that same vid series as time permits for folks.   Just a thought.   But awesome stuff!"
QILNlRvJlfQ,unable to save all the work gone :(
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hi Alex, can i get the Dataset Link please"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Could you kindly share the Tabel 1, table 2 ...all such trimmed tables?"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Love this , haven’t had a chance to give this a go but been wanting to try using tableau for ages. Had a thought whilst watching this video , does tableau have any animation capabilities? I thought it would look cool if the colour intensified as time went on and you could see which countries got affected quicker as well as seeing overall result"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"thanks
 great video!"
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Thank you, Alex. This has given me some very good confidence boost, and I am so glad I stumbled on your page. You have been doing amazing work for a lot of people, and I'm one of your beneficiaries. Thank you.🎉"
QILNlRvJlfQ,you awesome my guy really helpfull
QILNlRvJlfQ,Does anyone else's tableau public look a little different? Like the formatting etc... It's like it got an update after this and changed the placement of so many things which makes it harder to follow along.
QILNlRvJlfQ,"Hi, Alex can you mention three hypotheses for this dataset."
SVv0WwPzaUg,"You are a blessing,Alex! This momma is so proud of her son! Can’t wait to see what you do next! 💞💜"
SVv0WwPzaUg,"This was a fun video to watch, your family is awesome!"
SVv0WwPzaUg,"I have an ethical question for you Alex. What if you found out the company you are working for was using your work product for evil purposes. I can't think of an example, maybe you can. Something that would lead to deaths, or like rounding up unvaccinated for FEMA camps or children for trafficking or figuring out the best money laundering -- I don't know good examples. Would you quit, even though the pay was high? Would you collect evidence first? Or would you stay there, justifying your part wasn't evil. This is a serious question, and I'd like to know what kind of person I listen to."
SVv0WwPzaUg,“Slightly devastating” might be an understatement but “junk” was a killer there. Brutalized!
SVv0WwPzaUg,I'm so grateful I found you😊. I'm just rounding up a finance masters degree and with a lot of interest in analysis but been soo confused on how to merge both. I've spent the last few days binging and I just want you to know that your channel is amazing. A ton of practical knowledge and actual guidance...almost like you know my questions before I even ask them.
SVv0WwPzaUg,The easiest answer would be I turn data into money
SVv0WwPzaUg,"Hey Alex, why don't you make a ""life of an analyst"" video. It'd be great watching one of your whole work day video. 
Thank you."
SVv0WwPzaUg,"Cool idea, always brings out funny moments and reactions 😂"
SVv0WwPzaUg,That was hilarious hahahahaha. Keep up man
SVv0WwPzaUg,"Best DA channel so far 😍 
Well, I'm a beginner into DA field and finding your videos very helpful :)"
SVv0WwPzaUg,"This is gold Alex. I just transitioned from a Data Analyst to Product Owner, I landed a remote job as one for a Blockchain technology company and I fell in love with the role for 3 reasons:

1. I am the client/users voice inside the company (client-facing role)
2. I get to coordinate and communicate with a cross-functional team and learn from their expertise in totally different areas (I love learning new things).
3. I get to lead a product vision and launch it into the market (I love innovation).

I'm currently working on my Medium blog and Youtube channel about it. You inspired me to do so."
SVv0WwPzaUg,Can you please tell me which Python Course should i go for if i have covered the basics myself ???
SVv0WwPzaUg,"Hey Alex, I just wanted to ask if the 3 playlists on your channel about SQL are enough to get started with learning data analysis? Big fan by the way."
SVv0WwPzaUg,"Hey Alex, I would love a video about math and data analysis! That would help us a lot in understanding if you use math/what math do you use"
SVv0WwPzaUg,"you think that is possible to be a data analyst and web developer at the same time?
thanks!"
SVv0WwPzaUg,"Would love to see a video on what you think about Palantir and what they bring to the table when it comes to data analytics.
Keep up the amazing content!"
SVv0WwPzaUg,Liked before even watching. Then I watched. Your channel needs a love button.
SVv0WwPzaUg,Hey Alex I'm a student fresh out of high school and wanted to ask you whether I can reach my goal of taking an MSc in Data Science by taking a BSc IN Applied Computer Science furthermore is it better than taking BSc Computer Science
SVv0WwPzaUg,Do you need calculus for data analytics?

qfyynHBFOsM,"I'm doing this in Oct 2021 and apparently one of the code chunks where you need to convert new_vaccinations column to integer, the sum value now has exceeded 2,147,483,647. So instead of converting it to ""int"", you will need to convert to ""bigint"". Hope this helps everyone."
qfyynHBFOsM,My data set when downloaded and opened in excel only has 3 columns ? Please help
qfyynHBFOsM,For anyone wondering if this still applies in 2025 (August). I am happy to report it does! I completed all four projects and made a portfolio web page for my resume and landed an analyst job in three months (this was full time job hunting as I was unemployed) Thanks Alex!
qfyynHBFOsM,"Hi, could you please guide me with the error that's occurring in the beginning (the importing one). I spent an entire day trying to fix it, I don't where i'm going wrong"
qfyynHBFOsM,"I'm 15 min into project 1 and suuuuper impressed by how up to date you have kept these videos. like you uploaded links in description for the dataset which aren't available on the site in video but i was able to keep along with the video because you shared a copy/file of the dataset on the github repo.  

You also tried to explain stuff that experienced people would understand on their own like  tables and import issues. Really appreciative of the efforts and time you've put into this. <3 <3 <3"
qfyynHBFOsM,Am doing this on July 30th 2025 for those who can't import the excel into sql here is what worked for me change to excel file to csv dos then right click ur database choose tasks then import flat file browse ur file then next uncheck the box that says use rich data next.. then change the data types to float but test_units should be nvarchar(50) now it's (1) also population should be bigint not int or float if you do that then VOILA the file will be in during tables hope this works for everyone 🎉
qfyynHBFOsM,"Hi Alex, firstly, thank you for this project and the guided video. 
My question comes in at around 40:27, if we are trying to get TotalDeaths by Continent, shouldnt we take the Latest Death count from each country and then SUM them up according to continent. For example, in the case of NA, shouldnt we take the MAX number of total deaths of Canada and add that to the MAX number of total deaths of USA, and then group them by the North America Continent?
I wrote a whole CTE, but I do not know if I just over complicated. Would love any help!"
qfyynHBFOsM,Is the prerequisite for this only SQL or the entire data analyst Bootcamp?
qfyynHBFOsM,"At the temp table I'm getting an Msg 213, level 16, state 1 error. No solution seems to work. Please I need help🙏"
qfyynHBFOsM,"I am using MySql with dbeaver and I am having problem with creating CTE. I keep getting the error below;

can someone help please? I've googled and used chatgpt to find out what is wrong but its not working? Do i have to use SQL server?"
qfyynHBFOsM,"hello there! Im wrinting this on july 9, 2025.  Im from colombia, im starting this data analyst process and I want to tell you thank you.  there's no a lot of free and GOOD information in spanish to start this process. but  im very glad to find this kind of videos  in english , because looks very profesional to start my process to become a data analyst. regards"

qfyynHBFOsM,Useful
qfyynHBFOsM,"Took me 2.5 hours to get to 10 minutes of this video to set up everything. But it was worth it as I will never forget these steps.

Steps I followed:
1. Downloaded MySQL watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRwITQHszU. 
2. But did not know I had to install Workbench and so I tried reinstalling the whole thing again.
2. Realized I had to click to install workbench and other stuff.
3. Then realized Alex was using MS SQL Server Management Studio in this video so I closed Workbench and installed that.
4. But did not think that I had to install the MySQL Server to make a connection. For 15 minutes I was trying to connect to some non-existent server.
5. Went through his another video to do so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSlqWnP-Dy8&t=136s
6. Was trying to import excel file but kept getting an error (but different errors than what Alex got). So I checked with ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/c/685f1414-d658-8010-b1af-2dc520bb83f6
7. Took some time to follow all ChatGPT steps and finally realized I did not install the Microsoft SQL Server Native Client. Did that, and now I am in.

Just curious though, I know I did some silly things while setting this up, however, isn't this too complicated? I am only familiar with Postgre SQL, and that was so easy to get it running locally, and I believe it runs all SQL native functions and code, while MySQL has some query limitations. Correct me if I am wrong."

qfyynHBFOsM,"when downloading the dataset ,I'm getting only few columns can anybody help"
qfyynHBFOsM,"I dont think it is so important for most people, but I used Dbeaver for SQL, and I could not import that whole dataset for Covid Deaths. I had to clean the entire dataset with python first and then was able to use it on Dbeaver. It was also much easier,  then writing the code for only ""countries"" and no ""continents"" for each thing we had to execute. There is another Video on Data Cleaning with Python. I love it soooo muchhh."
qfyynHBFOsM,"Honestly, not wanna waste anyones time. But this video is time consuming, its better to do 100 sql queries better then wasting time in this video. I am not cretisizing but this is honest review. I almost took 4 days to do this becasue I was a beginner and I took and understood each and every step from chatgpt so this course project was waste of time. It was not point to point. story telling thing. He is a great person and his contents are good but in this video,  reputation fell down. Recommending everyone whoever watches comments, please do 100 sql codes rather then wasting time watching this video."
qfyynHBFOsM,"You might be good, but in sql video you have explained few things unnecessarily and it's very confusing to learn. Honestly, I got frustrated because I was always going to chatgpt to learn about your concepts. Please if you are doing any projects then explain each and every step without any extra information that is not required. We follow you and learning from your content but this took a lot of time and I learned 10% of this video."
qfyynHBFOsM,Thanks Alex
qfyynHBFOsM,"Doing this in Jun 2025, still very stuck. I do not have the db->task->import data option because it says 'this feature is not currently available in this version or the database does not exist' (Im am using SSMS 2022). I tried the other method suggested by Alex but I run into another error message about the 'ConnectionString not yet initiated'. The last thing I tried was db->task->import flat file, but by the last stage it says there is an error inserting data into table because 'Column 'continent' does not allow DBNull.Value'. Anyone has any ideas?"
qfyynHBFOsM,"Unable to import data from Excel. Has been so frustrating. I know this video was made in 2021 but is there any way to do it now? Just been stuck in the import part, nothing has been working for me sadly. Just feel like giving up."

qfyynHBFOsM,"hi, i'm having repeated columns on the imported data.
e.g Alex's data maybe the first couple columns he starts to see non-null,
for me, i only start seeing them at like column 260+ 
also I observed a lot of data with same info being repeated, is it I loaded the data wrongly?"

qfyynHBFOsM,please I want old dataset because now is changed
qfyynHBFOsM,after downloading the dataset when opening that in excel it only showing detail of 3 columns i dont know what is happening but tried many times downloading this still the same issue
qfyynHBFOsM,"Thank you, Alex. Good practice, good work. For data type, since I uploaded csv file everything looks like varchar. I changed necessary fields to the right data type; here is my code. I hope it will be helpful for someone who cannot fix the problem. I am just at the begging, so I will need to alter the other table as well. And maybe another column.  
ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths ALTER COLUMN date DATE;
ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths ALTER COLUMN total_cases BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths ALTER COLUMN new_cases BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths ALTER COLUMN total_deaths BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE CovidDeaths ALTER COLUMN new_deaths BIGINT;
And later when you divide int by int you get 0. So just make one of them float. Here is my code: 
SELECT location, date,  total_cases, total_deaths,
CAST(total_deaths AS FLOAT) / total_cases * 100 AS death_percentage
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%states%'
order by 1,2"

qfyynHBFOsM,1:05:28 this query is wrong because if you see the percentage vaccinated for 'Gibraltar' it will show 182.11% which means total_vaccinated is more than population which means new_Vaccination column count is wrong instead use max(people_fully_vaccinated) to find count of vaccinated individuals per country. and max(people_fully_vaccinated)/ population for percenatage_vaccinated

qfyynHBFOsM,I am not able to download the dataset? is the link correct?
qfyynHBFOsM,If you are having issues  trying to import to mySQL Workbench - Save file as CSV then use Visual Studio Code to change the encoding to UTF-8 without BOM. You will be able to do this using the bottom-right corner of your VS Code window. If it says UTF with Bom change this to UTF-8 by clicking it then click save with encoding then UTF-8 then save file. I also used VSCode to find and replace blank cells with NULL. Hope this helps anyone who has had the same issue as me :)

m1KcNV-Zhmc,The way you capture moments is so beautiful. 😍
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This helped me with [insert task]. You’re a lifesaver! 😇
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Amazing video! Your hard work truly paid off. 👏
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This song is on repeat! 🎶
m1KcNV-Zhmc,The editing here is seamless. Love how it all comes together!
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Amazing video! Your hard work truly paid off. 👏
m1KcNV-Zhmc,This content is gold. Thank you for putting this out here!
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Great explanation of subqueries.  Thanks.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Amazing video! Your hard work truly paid off. 👏
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I'm still confused about the FROM :( I'm learning from DataCamp and Alex but this whole subquery course is messing me up.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Which SQL ide do you use???
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Man marry me😂, you're the best😅❤"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Barton Pike
m1KcNV-Zhmc,going to practice
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Your name should be awesome Alex!!👌
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"This is a great video about subquery. Thank you, Alex!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,do you have any suggestions on where I could practice these functions more? and this playlist is really beneficial thanks for the time and effort!
m1KcNV-Zhmc,what is the tool you using?
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I find the comments ridiculous...
These kind of subqueries are things you learn after 1 week of work on a sql dwh...Is Just basic basic basic stuff..."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"great content.
had a bit of difficulty sticking it out because of all the vocal fry. No offense intended.
I would like to suggest doing some vocal warm-up exercises to make it more aurally pleasing, but I'm also an idiot so don't take what I'm saying too seriously"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Thank you for sharing, really really appreciate this. I would love to see more advanced stuff, specifically examples where you're using synonyms across different servers within source stored procedures (used to populate stage tables) to make joins along with ctes. I am at an internship right now, and still in my first year of college, I feel completely lost when working in these health insurance databases, most videos on youtube don't really go into more complicated stuff that I work with everyday so thank you again

Many of these queries in the code base are 3000+ lines long and my brain goes numb looking at all the subqueries, joins, and obscure functions I have no idea what they do"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Class jclg
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Enpache
m1KcNV-Zhmc,thank you so much for this tutorial
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Very helpful. Than you.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hi! I just tried the syntax for subquery in where but I tried it also using join and got exact result

*Alex subquery in Where*
select EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary
from EmployeeSalary
where EmployeeID in (
	select EmployeeID
	from EmployeeDemographics
	where Age > 30
)

*my syntax*:
select demo.EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary
from EmployeeDemographics as demo
join EmployeeSalary as sal
	on demo.EmployeeID = sal.EmployeeID
where Age > 30

Anyway, I find your tutorial very informative and tried to use some work arounds if they will have the same output. Thank you always, Alex!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Done for SQL Tutorial after 3 weeks of learning and spending 2-3 hours in each session while creating different scenarios outside the samples. hehe Mygee! I made it! haha! Thank you Alex! Next step is to get a certificate of SQL before proceeding to the other Tools. Hopefully I'm doing it right. Lol
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I am Finally done with SQL on this amazing channel. But got to go back for some revisions.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"As someone who received SQL training during master's degree, I have to say that I learned much more from Alex's SQL lessons than what I learned at school. You are amazing Alex!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"This wasn't bad but do you anything other than ""really quick""? You said it 21 times in 8:30"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How many times can someone say “really quick”…wow. good stuff tho
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How tf you set an alias for a subquery as 'a'
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I just finished the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced SQL videos. Thank you, Alex, for publishing these. I'm adding SQL to my tool belt. These were a fantastic first look at the language."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Slowing down your pace a bit would help the absolute zero beginner.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"This looks like a really interesting subject. I didn’t know anything about it until now, but I suspect the exponential, geometric, and weibull distributions might factor in?"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Brilliant SQL Tutorial Series! Every Video has really helped to fill in any potential gaps in my knowledge and even reinforce my existing skills. Thanks Alex!
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Just to clarify, only the where statement combined with the subquery can only have 1 column selected? SELECT and FROM can select all columns if wanted from a subquery? thanks!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Should have started watching you long ago ..
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Where is primary and foreign key video could you please share the link
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Mr Alex.  I'm currently following your steps on tge sql project  but it shows me operand divide. And it is giving me errors . Please someone show help me out
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I have enjoyed your videos. I have been programming and working as a dba for a long time, 28 years - since sql server 4.2. (Do you remember *=). I would consider myself an expert in sql server. I was even able to pick up a couple things in your sql videos that I didn’t know or at least did 8n a different way. Great job. Looking forward to the python and newer content. Working towards learning how to use ML to help clean data and find errors over the next year."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Excellent Tutorial
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Instead of doing WHERE EmployeeID IN (SELECT EmployeeId FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE Age > 30), you could do WHERE EXISTS (SELECT EmployeeId FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE Age > 30 AND EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeId = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeId). No? Which one is more efficient."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,that was really quick
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I'll stop here at DAY-4
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Still confusing AF, but I think I will get there at some point.  Thanks!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I just finished the SQL tutorial from beginner to advanced. Now I want to start the portofolio project but part 2 & 4 of that video are missing. Let me know when those video already uploaded. thank you very much and sorry if there's something wrong about this comment, I'm still learning English"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Where this may be good for beginners I was hoping for some actual advanced queries. These were sort of common sense basic IMO. Where I work they have some COMPLEX subqueries and I was hoping to get something even remotely similar. But i'm just not the target audience for this video obviously.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How do you do this on MySQL or MariaDB?
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hey Alex! All your videos on Sql Tutorials are awesome! Can you make a video on how to use primary and foreign keys in Sql Server? You've mentioned in one of your videos that you'll be covering those topics but I haven't come across the PK and FK in the Sql Tutorials(maybe I've missed them). Or if you have a video already out, could you direct me to it? Thanks for all the videos, they've helped me understand SQL Server much better!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Thank you so much, Alex. Your videos are superb."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I thought I knew SQL, but this whole series of videos help me understand that I don't know anything. Although your explanation was ease to follow and understand, I feel that need more study to really understand all the concepts.Thanks a lot for your time to make this series."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thanks it was helpful!
m1KcNV-Zhmc,question. i'm confused why does GROUP BY not work when writing subqueries? i didn't quite understand..
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Holy mackerel! We think and code exactly the same.This is exactly how I teach people about sub-queries, and partition by, and even the rarely used 'right join' which is similar to 'not in' where clause sub-query."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thanks Alex!
m1KcNV-Zhmc,How about doing an AVG SALARY for each employee instead of AVG FOR ALL? How do you query that?
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hi Alex! I'm following you in LinkedIn. Pls, keep me post it about the data analyst bootcamp you plan to launch. I, myself I am changing career. I want to be more technical marketer with strong focus on web analytics and touching here and there analytics subjects...."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Take a shot everytime you hear "" really quickly"" and try to survive"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Great content Thanks
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I've just finished this series (1 week). I'm going to rewatch it all again (hopefully 1 day) and then start the Portfolio Project. I started from 0 and your videos are purely useful content, it made me understand SQL really fast. 
Thanks from Spain. 
PD: I will communicate here when I finish the course completly and also if I am lucky enough to get a job."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"The entire, Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced playlists are a gold mine, Alex!
Thank You!!!"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"On my journey through the boot camp...

This comes in handy. Thank you."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,I'm so grateful for the SQL tutorial video. Thank you for sharing your knowledge. 😊📹💾
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Can anyone please help me understand: Why is there a FROM operator in both the outer query and the subquery?  

Hi, I love the way you explain things.  People have very different ways of explaining programming/coding concepts, and your ways of seeing things really works well for me.  

SELECT EMPLOYEEID, SALARY, (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEESALARY)
              FROM EMPLOYEESALARY; 

What does the FROM operator do in the outer query that it doesn't do in the inner query?"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"King, you are the best sql teacher on youtube. Thanks SO much for making content on sql concepts that are actually used in everyday work flows."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hello Alex
I love ur videos they v been guiding me through data analysis but i v issues with my sql"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,There is a missing pieces that is preventing me from cracking this thing i just can't figure out what it is.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Subquery can also alternatively be replaced by temp table or CTE.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Bad example on partition by... but everyone on YT copies one another and gives non-realistic examples. For anyone reading for people who actually work with  SQL. Partition by in a Nested join subquery will give you a count when grouping by something different or you can use it in the outer. For example 5 nested tables 1 primary table nested (from table). The partition by in the outer you can cntd partition by x,y,z fields to produce a value. For example lets say you are running daily dates and want a count distinct by accounts etc. You will 100% not get the right count. Why? your nested quries are pushing out numbers by day (fine with sums) (Not fine with counts, count distincts). Essentially you are counting distinct daily and it must be dealt with inside nested query + out or in the outer. These things are what should be covered. However, instead you get people who i'd suspect don't know anything about SQL and downloaded some videos and copied it over to their own version. Anyone rushing over partition by trust me close their video. It's massively powerful and in all honesty one of the most important functions along with LAG/LEAD that you can possibly grasp. Especially aggregating up/down across multiple timeframes. Once again real job vs playing around pressing play for kids on youtube."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"SubQueries, I keep coming back here"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thank you so much Alex for providing such a valuable skills for free. It really made me become a aspiring data analyst.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thanks Alex for teaching Advance SQL REALLY QUICK.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thank you so much for posting this series. I am learning SQL for the first time and your videos are extremely helpful :)
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hi Alex.  Thank you very much for this series of videos.  For me, your method of teaching is easy to follow and understand.  Are perhaps you going to produce a tutorial on Goolge's Looker too in the near future?"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Hello teacher where can I load those data to practice following your explanations?
Thank you"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Just finished watching all sql tutorial videos in this bootcamp. Time to watch the portfolio project.
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I'm curious about the alias or variable ""a"" you gave to the subquery. Just trying to understand why this is necessary."
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Thanks for the video! Studying SQL with DataCamp but the explanation on subqueries is very short..
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"I wanna ask a question, that can we build charts and graphs in mysql for reporting?"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,Great content
m1KcNV-Zhmc,keep up the good work sir. I have been following your videos and techtfq videos as well and learned so much
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"hello Alex and thanks for greate videos.
What ""over ()"" means?
thanks"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"Today i have completed SQL😩😩🥰❤️ Am so grateful for having found your channel, i believe by 2024 i will land a data analyst role in government or health care all studying from this bootcamp from scratch🙏🙏🙏 never been as committed, thank you so much once again, tomorrow am starting off with Python"
m1KcNV-Zhmc,You just basically saved my career now
m1KcNV-Zhmc,"UPDATE youtube
SET button_Name = 'star_rating'
WHERE button_Name = 'like'

here we go @Alex you have got my 5 stars ;)"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Thank you so much for these videos. I relate to your career story so much! I was wondering about what a data analyst role can be in the clinical setting. I am a former respiratory therapist and professor of biology and I really want to analyze clinical(patient) data. Not as interested in insurance analysis. Do you know much about how data analysts are used for clinical data, if at all?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,It was very refreshing to hear that a data Analyst not necessarily needs to become a data scientist. I share the same feeling more towards data engineering and with this video I have realized that I am not crazy for thinking about it hahaha
IZRe0nwkuXc,I am currently a data analyst in a data science department. Personally I enjoy putting data together to tell a story more than building predictive models. I've never felt the need to jump into being an official data scientist
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex, thank you for your videos, they are super helpful.
I'm not sure where to ask questions; I watched a video today on an intro to stats and near the end of the video he talked about p-value hacking. Do you know about this? I am trying to get into data analysis and am wondering if this sort of stats stuff relates to data analysis roles at all?
Thank you again."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Do I need to learn python in-depth or ""python for data analysis""?

P.S.: Coding haunts me😶‍🌫"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex. Like your videos... The way you present yourself and your thoughts is really appreciable. Last year I was thinking of transitioning my career from an engineer to become a Data analyst. Your videos helped me a lot. Your videos also helped me to choose the right courses and skills. And now I  have all the right skillset to become a data analyst. Thanks! 😄
IZRe0nwkuXc,"I'm more fascinated by data engineering too.  The thing most data scientists hate about their job is data cleansing, but that's one of my favorite aspects of being a data analyst."
IZRe0nwkuXc,Watched this video as I sit in the middle of no where Ohio 😂
IZRe0nwkuXc,"This is really the most authentic Q&A video I'v ever watched, love your content and wishing you the best of luck on your new role"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Thanks Alex. I like how honest you are when answering questions about career and goals.
IZRe0nwkuXc,really am not so good at programming and i would like to study data science or data analyst can i pursue it
IZRe0nwkuXc,Thanks for the information
IZRe0nwkuXc,if only i had a teacher like you in my school tysm alex
IZRe0nwkuXc,New subscriber here! Great channel. I'm a recovering digital advertiser transitioning into becoming a data analyst. Looking forward to diving through the SQL videos that you've made! :D
IZRe0nwkuXc,"You said you regret not having done computer science but you can learn in your free time, right?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Amen about doing Python first, of course that is the ML mindset."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex,
This was a really great video
can you make a video about
""How much math do you really need to know to be a data analyst?"""""
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Great video alex
Thank u so much 
I have found ur channel and it's a big boost for me to link my medical background ( I am a pharmacist working for 3 years now ) with data analysis which I really like cuz the combination of these two set a lot of potentials imo in medical field
Currently I am working in data analytics certificate in the second course and at same time I am working in Udacity course ( there are 3 tracks) I am in the Challenger track ( next one is professional and advanced )
Which one u think I should put all my time and effort ( Google or Udacity) cuz feel I am distracted between both switching back and forth !
Hope u can give ur insights I would really appreciate it
Best greetings from Egypt"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hey, Alex
Thanks for answering my previous question.
Do you need to make any notes or revise in order to complete the google data analytics at a high level, or are you just required to watch the videos and do the questions in order to complete the course and gain the certificate?
Thanks"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi, Alex, I hope you ar doing well. Do you think that being 30 years old with no experience apart from excel is a huge liability if I want to start learning data analyst skills and potentially look for a job as one?

Keep up the amazing channel!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,I don't have any questions for you. I just wanted to say you are doing a great job 👍
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hi Alex I see Business Intelligence Engineer and Data Engineer start to become more popular these days. Do you think companies are starting to classified Business Intelligence Engineer as a distinct role than general Data Analyst? Will there be a future for this role?
IZRe0nwkuXc,Math was never my strong point. Do you feel there is a deep need for it as a deep level to succeed as as analyst?
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hey,i just got an internship as a data analyst in a startup. thanks to you too. but now the problem is how do I progress as a data analyst. could you share some resources to get more insights and better understanding on data."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hey Alex, bit of a longer question here with some background information if you have the time:

So I am a PhD student in a social science field that stresses quantitative research. Essentially, what this means for me is that we utilize software such as R and STATA heavily, deal with large data sets/merging numerous data sets together, running various regression models, interpreting regression outputs, and running diagnostics on these regressions and engaging in data transformation to resolve any errors in the regression models. (Along with data visualization of descriptive statistics and regression outputs).


With all of that being said, my excursions on job hunting websites have led me to so many data analyst positions where it appears that none of the things I practice in academia are advertised as required skills in these respective data analyst positions. Am I simply looking for the wrong type of job? Do different types of data analysts do different things? Is there a uniform set of skills, as opposed to programs you need to know (such as SQL being a must), that practically all data analysts are required to know?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Would you be able to talk about what I can do to get from mid level analyst to senior level? Or is it purely on experience?
IZRe0nwkuXc,Please do a video on projects that can help a person stand out in an entry level role. Also take us through all the steps so that we can have a idea on how to do our own projects.
IZRe0nwkuXc,17:49 It’s awesome how you’re crystal clear on your passion! Great video Alex!
IZRe0nwkuXc,Is it possible to become a Data analyst and also a Data engineer. Like having equal experience on both and decide to analyze and also do the engineering work?
IZRe0nwkuXc,"The thing is that data analyst and data scientist are very different things. I was a data scientist for 3 years, our department got consolidated and I was let go. Due to extremely high work requirements for a data scientist I actually was looking at a data analyst role and quickly learned that I have never built KPIs, SSRS reports, and very basic forecasting. In one of my interviews I was given a task to do some simple EDA on a medical dataset. When I was done with the task, I actually built a pretty solid XGboost / Classification Models in Python ##(I know python, R, MATLAB, SQL and have written my own packages, cleanup functions) ## including the requested data cleanup EDA. In presenting my findings the manager and her team were more confused with my analysis than anything else. Needless to say I learned that you can’t go from data scientist to data analyst. Recently I got hired back as a data scientist with a different company."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Thank you for the transparency! As far as data science goes, do you think the field is getting hard to break into? Will the field eventually ""close""? And if so, when?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex, when you say "" if you have 2 years experience of Data Analyst, you should know a lot"", I think in depends where you did it, for example, I started my 2 first experiences working with SAS Software, It was not SQL, I needed after to learn sql, python etc

One other stuff, I have a computer science degree, and sometimes I think It was not necessary to do 5 years to do this job, because It was a lot of Math, but really who really cares in Company, It's better to be good in programmation and communication to do this job"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Big big big thanks for this video.
And really looking for your SQl videos and portfolio video.
I was just looking to get started in Data Analyst role and help for it and you really are helping me a lot.
Hope so I get into my passion!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"You mentioned that you would like to move into a data engineer role, can a data analyst move into a data engineer role?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,I'm new here and found so much related to my career. I wanna be into data analytics and i have to start my learning. Your content has clear my path and has given me such valuable guidance. Thank you! Your channel is the most clear search i gave gone through till now. 🤗
IZRe0nwkuXc,heyy Alex.... Is front end engineering has more number of job opportunities that Data analytics/engineering??
IZRe0nwkuXc,Ive been 3 years into my Journey using mainly tableau. Ive been spoiled by solution architects writing SQL that i visualize. Think its time to learn more SQL!
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Got SQL( a bit beyond basic select snd joins), Tableau and Excel covered, Excel actually pretty well, as I ve worked with it for a year. Now, the hardest part is getting a job! Literally all jobs I'm seeing out there ask for at least two years of experience.. This is the hardest part to deal with. 
I 'd like to see a video about legit job requirements; I think I ve seen the one, maybe two, about resumes, and the one about totally unrealistic job requirements, but I think I d appreciate more detailed content in this direction. I got laid off last year when the pandemic hit, so I no longer have the option of transitioning, but have to actually start from zero. 
Getting the skills is half of the task, the other half being applying them; and I find this part much more challenging.
But great work so far, I really appreciate your content."
IZRe0nwkuXc,Really looking forward to your SQL portfolio video. I searched high and low and I literally couldn’t find anything 😭
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Really good video! Quick question though, but if you could give a percentage or break down of what data analyst skills you use day to day what would it be?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Is statistics obligatory to become a data analyst ?
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex. I regret to not have asked this question in AMA. What job role and salary one can expect if one has 2 years of experience in operations and post that a MBA in data analytics concentration? Will he still be considered a fresher?
IZRe0nwkuXc,He's not a data scientist because I have monopolized all the data science.
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey there! I really appreciate the videos you are putting out. You have helped me a lot in overcoming questioning my own capabilities for a data scientist role. I just recently was accepted into a master's program for data science and you have played a large part in helping me get there! I just wanted to relay a sincere thankyou from a fellow Texan and future data analyst. :)
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Ohio - yeah you are  right, we don't get pay that much lol..  I have compared my salary with other states and we don't make that much..  what do you think about micro masters from MIT and Harvard?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hi Alex. I really appreciate your channel. I'm wondering if your estimate of entry-level data analyst salaries is a little too low? The information for the Google data analytics certificate lists $67,900  as the average entry-level salary. Do you think that's unrealistic? Maybe that average is skewed with all the jobs in Silicon Valley. Thanks for any input."
IZRe0nwkuXc,Timestamps for questions please Thanks!
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Great video! I really liked that you shared your thoughts on why you prefer data analyst work over data science work. Keep doing what makes you happy! Anyways, this has motivated me to start my final project in my data analysis course haha"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Heck yeah, thank you for answering my question Alex!   I'm always curious on what others in our field are planning next in their careers.  I'm also a little unsure as well on where I want to go next, so it was refreshing to hear that others are encompassing the same thoughts and issues when planning for the future.  Keep up the content!

P.S. Regarding my first question (Python vs R), IMHO I would have installed Pandas first... ha!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Do you think data analyst job will be automated with AI?
IZRe0nwkuXc,"This was great! Thanks, Alex!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"I'm taking a data science specialization rn, currently going through statistical inference. How important is that in terms of data analytics (which is what I think I would like to land a job in)? Also if I already have a decent base in r, (retrieving, cleaning, and graphing data) how important is it to still learn sql?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hi....pls do full project video on sql...plzzz
IZRe0nwkuXc,As a current data analyst (health informatics analyst) living in Ohio but working (remotely) out of Michigan I can tell you that Alex is correct. Recently had an offer for a data analyst role and the hourly rate was less than $18.00.
IZRe0nwkuXc,"I'm à recent college graduate with realistically about a year or so experience... I mean I have been in my Co op role for almost 3 years.... In my internship supporting a fortune 500 company IT dept.... Very experienced in excel, comfortable with SQL, learning python.... And I feel like I'm ill-equipped. Struggling finding a job. I feel like I have fundamental knowledge of alot of things like data mining, machine learning, nosql data structure, big data, etc.... But I'm no expert at none of these. Any advice or tips?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"I'm just working on my BA thesis, your videos motivate me since you're so passionate about it!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Thanks Alex for a great video! I've been sort of slowly working towards Data Science. However, the more I look into the field, the more I see I'm probably better suited for a Data Analysis role. A good part of the reason for my change has been your very informative videos, so thank you. Yes, DA is the sexy cool job everyone is pushing but damn...the MATH!  MY GOD, THE MATH!!!!!!! LOL You might as well just add a dual Statistics major along with anything else you're studying. That, and making data models doesn't seem that interesting. 

Watching your videos (along with Ken Jee and Jen's Career Force videos) has really helped me refine what I should be working towards. Thanks again!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"If you just jump right into Python, you can get really lost - yep, been there."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Wicked, I love your channel man: good to hear an honest opinion about degrees and that you don't just give any old bull about ""no regrets"" and ""just follow your passion"", you're open about thinking you could've done better with a different education. Fair enough, I know the feeling! :D Am looking forward to the portfolio video! Peace from UK"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Great answers Alex, thank you!"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"You didn't mention Information Systems as a good major so I'll give my experience. I just graduated studying it and learned R, Python, SQL, and an array of database management skills. I think for an analyst, it is better than CS. If you want to be a dev or data scientist, then CS is much better. Hope this helps clarify to anyone deciding between majors"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Appreciate the last answer, Alex. We need more exposure for this other perspective. There's way too much narrative about data analyst as a means to an end. It's almost just assumed that of course everybody wants to be a data scientist. Nah."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hello, Alex. Great video. I had some questions as well, wanted to clarify some thing.
1) Do you recommend learning T-SQL or PL/SQL as well? 
2) What type of datasets to use for a project as a beginner? From a simple dataset to a more intermediate level.
3) How to make sense of data, to spot trends, facts, relationship between them and make inferences? It would be great if you can do a project series.
4) I've been toying with the idea of freelancing. So, if I get a project, how do I go about asking client the questions? Like, what are they looking for or just how do I communicate with them? I have no work experience and honestly this part terrifies me a bit. 
5) Suppose a project is at it's end, we have made a report/dashboard. What comes after this? How to convey to the client what insights we have made?"
IZRe0nwkuXc,"In the Google Certificate, I've learned that being a Data Analyst could be a stepping stone to being a Data Engineer as well. Do you ever get asked about that career path? If so, is it more geared towards programming? Or does it require the necessary math skills like being a Data Scientist? Thanks."
IZRe0nwkuXc,I really appreciate the fact that your answers and reaction to the questions were quite honest and real. I enjoyed and learned a lot while watching this Q & A. Thanks a lot and keep doing it !!
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Hey Alex, I hope you are doing well. I am in Business Management Major, Planning to transition to Data Analytics, Can you give me some tips on what to learn first for Data Analytics, And any other advisr you can give. Thank you."
IZRe0nwkuXc,Your videos motivate me to work towards my goal! Thankyou Alex
IZRe0nwkuXc,Great Video I have a degree in Mathematics. Is Data  Analytics suited for me?
IZRe0nwkuXc,One thing I haven't figured out is the best way to find data sets to use for practical practice or portfolio projects. Any tips?
IZRe0nwkuXc,"Im very excited for the project videos, I think it would be to see a professional run through some examples and use the full technology stack."
IZRe0nwkuXc,"""This is going to be pretty laid-back."" Awesome! Because I hate all your stodgy, buttoned-up videos. Take the tuxedo off and relax, man."
IZRe0nwkuXc,Data analyst remote work
IZRe0nwkuXc,Hey Alex. Big fan. Awesome video. How does the Google data analytics certification compare with the data analytics or data science track on datacamp? Thanks
IZRe0nwkuXc,"If you would please answer my question which is, I have been working as a customer service industry and really I got upset of it, recently I'm studying data analysis from udicty platform, my degree is accounting but I don't like numbers at all, however as far I went through the course I found myself adapted with numeric stuff so I wanted to know when I'm getting deeper into it would it requires me to do more complex mathematics thing, or it is more about mining data and visualize it"
IZRe0nwkuXc,Bro when are you going to upload the whole series of the SQL videos. I'm looking forward to it.
9RRQtNnq3s0,"In Google Advanced Data Analytics Certifications , Python , Statistics, ML , Data Science etc is Taught"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"What should I  begin with google data analysis certificate 
OR google data analysis ( professional )  certificate"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Your inspiration to many Alex Very humble Clear explanation
9RRQtNnq3s0,Codebasics kaisa h??
9RRQtNnq3s0,I'm halfway through my IBM Data Analytics and I love it!!
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Thanks for the comparison. There are lots of these reviews/comparison videos but no one really addresses what seems to me a pretty big detail (as someone who is yet to take either course) and that is job type that the course states that it is designed to set up its students for. 
IBM: Data Scientist (CA$102,745 median entry-level salary for Data Scientist)
Google: Data Analyst (CA$76,837 median entry-level salary for Data Analyst)

Why is there this big difference?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,IBM is still better
9RRQtNnq3s0,GOOGLE TEAM
9RRQtNnq3s0,I loved Sally too!
9RRQtNnq3s0,"I took the Google course when it first came out and did not like it. I hope they've improved it since then. I did not like any of the instructors. It was too much fluff and not enough in-the-weeds info about the technical skills. I felt like it barely scratched the surface of SQL and R and the concepts they did review were poorly explained. The job consortium and employment help did not lead to a job, and a LinkedIn group for others taking the course confirmed I wasn't the only one who wasn't helped by these resources. Unless it's now much different and has had a major revamp I would not recommend it."
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hey Alex(and strangers willing to help) I wanted to know if I could still get a job with the help of Google if I am not American or living in the US? I know this video is old and I really do not know much about anything right now but this would be really helpful. Thank you in advance
9RRQtNnq3s0,"The people that teach you the lessons on the Google cert are just reading it, it feels unnatural. I prefer the IBM style where animations are presented while the content is read, much easier to focus."
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hey Alex, now that it's been over 3 years. Would you say that your opinions have changed, or the courses haven't changed much to warrant it?

I'd love to see an update video"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Found this video today. It's great to hear about the differences between the IBM and Google Data Analytics Certification offerings. I am planning to enrol into your Data Analytics Bootcamp and go for certifications for some of the technologies (eg. PowerBI, Python, etc). If I'm already embarking on this route, do I still need Google's certificate? Will it add value to what I'll be getting from Microsoft, Python Institute, etc?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Where can I learn python while taking the Google course?
9RRQtNnq3s0,I started the IBM one bc I figured google would focus on google sheets when excel is the business norm but I know what ya mean with the more personal touch google has when I took the digital marketing certification
9RRQtNnq3s0,😅Thumbs up to Sally.  Hopefully Sally & his wife are still friends☮.
9RRQtNnq3s0,Too many bots in the comments
9RRQtNnq3s0,Sally me ganhou kk
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Thank you for this Excellent video.

Please, I have a question. 

Is it possible to certify a whole analytic Agency ( an entreprise which proposes mainly services of data analysis) in order to be more credible?

If yes, how?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,I just signed up for the course and I’m excited to meet Sally 😂
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Would you say using google sheets will conflict with your usage of Excel, or are they similair in way?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hi, thanks this video is helpful.can you please share the link to the channel by Sally?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,hello Sir first of all thanks for providing this content I had one question if I purchase One course for 1 month and not completed within it does my course expire?or does it asks for another Payment?
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks
9RRQtNnq3s0,"This is super helpful because ive been comparing the two trying to spot the differences. Also, with IBM, were there any concerns with language barriers? Ik for me when learning i struggled in statistics when the instructor spoke a different language."
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Thank you Alex , i discovered you from LinkedIn now am hooked to your channel as someone trying to switch to Data analyst am learning alot"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"After getting enrolled in any course and successfully completing it, will I need to pay extra money for the certificate?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,What Python course do you recommend?
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hey, Alex. I am completely new in this field and was looking for something like this. I aspire to be a Data Analyst but in my previous attempts, I have failed twice. I think again, I'll opt for it as I don't want to give up and maybe this time I might actually make it. I have learned about the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate recently and it's looking right for me. Do you have any thoughts?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"I tried both. I finished Google because it was much better structured. Also, the IBM courses range between great quality at a high level of understanding to unclear and irrelevant questions with countless numbers of grammatical mistakes. Many of IBM's voiceovers are likely AI-generated, I think too..."
9RRQtNnq3s0,R is going extinct
9RRQtNnq3s0,I prefer IBM simple and straightforward
9RRQtNnq3s0,Totally agree with you on the Google style vs IBM.
9RRQtNnq3s0,I already have my Google Data Analytics Certificate. Would it be better to get the Advanced Google Data Analytis Certificate or the IBM Data Analytics Certificate?
9RRQtNnq3s0,What about google it support vs ibm support?
9RRQtNnq3s0,"well, hope your wife didn't see this video yet.. "
9RRQtNnq3s0,I am an absolute beginner. Can you please recommend to me which Python course should I take along with the Google Data Analyst Certification course? I do not have any basic knowledge of Python either.
9RRQtNnq3s0,@this point my curiosity is now well fed. I am enrolling Google Data Analytics as well as PYTHON programming on a different platform. Please what platform do you recommend for python?
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hi, I am a freshman at college, majoring in Economics (learning statistics and Econometrics). I hope to sharpen my skills before I look for internship. So Data analysis is on my mind. Which certificate is more suitable for me? Thanks."
9RRQtNnq3s0,"i don't like that google instructors look, talk and move like bots. i also think IBM course teaches better programs :)"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Sally is really great in that Google module.
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Thanks a lot Alex ,Just completed Google Data Analytics certificate and now enrolled in Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate. Love from Pakistan ❤"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"both are useless if you're seeking a data analyst job without a Math of Computer science degrees, it worked of few people ONLY in the U.S. and Canada while it's as good as a toilet paper everywhere else, however if you're a college student and want an introduction into the field, well it may give you some tips!"
9RRQtNnq3s0,answer is both
9RRQtNnq3s0,"I would say do both :) I learned R and Python in college and they both good usage to it. Man, once i am done with python, i wanna try Google Analytics. Thanks for the recommendation 🎉"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Have you herd about the new product of microsoft fabric? It is more and more interesting. AI is now digging into data analytics world.
9RRQtNnq3s0,Please drop the link for both courses. Thank you.
9RRQtNnq3s0,Google
9RRQtNnq3s0,Really helpful video. Thank you!
9RRQtNnq3s0,I got both and neither of them got me any job so 🤷
9RRQtNnq3s0,Awesome. You make things really easy for beginners. I really appreciate it.
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hello Alex . I would like to know if there is a difference between data analysis and data science ? if yes which professional certificate would you recommend ?
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Honestly, I have no idea why watching someone talk to you is better than listening to someone with actual slides on the subject...I get tired of fun talk training on serious subjects...thats a problem actually."
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks Alex For your valuable recommendation.
9RRQtNnq3s0,so guys did actually anybody a job after finishing the course. ?
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks! Been thinking about this for weeks.
9RRQtNnq3s0,"This video helps me a lot! I'm just in that situation, meaning wich data analyst program should I take and I think that after this video I definitely will go for the Google data analyst program. Thanks for made life easier 😎
Btw! I also prefer someone explaining yourself over a ppt slide or whatever that was! 
Best!!"
9RRQtNnq3s0,If you're paying for Coursera plus it becomes a question whether or not you should grab both of them.
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Agree!
Google Data Analytics + Crash course on Python 
Then Google Project Management will land you into something 🎉"
9RRQtNnq3s0,I am on Sally's course now and I love her very much!!!
9RRQtNnq3s0,Can I land the job where I will get paid nothing. But at least learn)))!
9RRQtNnq3s0,"I've done Google data analytics certificate. And I knew nothing about data analytics. It felt like they lead you by the hand like a baby 7 modules out of 8 and than drop u by the capstone make's you feel useless. 
9 months for nothing"
9RRQtNnq3s0,I wonder if Alex's wife is worried about Sally....
9RRQtNnq3s0,Nice video but you omitted a huge deciding factor for most people. . .cost.
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hi Alex, Thanks for this video!  I was doing the Google Python cert, but I will also add this cert as well.  Cheers"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"I've spent about a day or two manually comparing both courses to find a winner. Thank you Alex, you've made my endless search come to an end with this video. I think it's worth mentioning that IBM's had the ACE recommended feature, for people looking to earn up to 12 college credits.

I recently chose to start a career in Data Science/Analysis over Product Design and this will be my first course to actualize that dream/goal/target. 

Wish me luck 🙂"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Good info.  I just started course 3 in the Google data analytics. I subbed.
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hi Alex, can managers take this Google DnA Certificate? Or only meant for beginners ?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Google uses google spreadsheets and ibm uses excel, does this make a difference?"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Do you still recommend Google certification or something else 🤔?
9RRQtNnq3s0,"I got them both, but I felt IBM certification is more professional, IBM courses include some model building, model evaluation, and some other deep knowledge about data analyzing"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"...... ...THANK YOU MY FRIEND !!!!  THIS IS A GREAT GIFT TO SOCIETY !!!........

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THE    HARD WORK       & SAVING ME HUNDREDS OF WASTED HOURS .................................TERIMA KASH * DANKE * OBRIGADO*

****"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Alex: ""Honey, what's for dinner?""

Wife: ""I don't know, ask Sally"""
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Like always great video.
Now I don't need to flip the coin."
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks for sharing
9RRQtNnq3s0,Just finished course 1….
9RRQtNnq3s0,that moodle 5 for google certificate isso annoying
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thank you
9RRQtNnq3s0,Could anyone explain how this course will be helpful for business analysts for their careers for commerce and management purposes?
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Am going to consume both, almost done with course 1(Google)"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Best video Ever.
9RRQtNnq3s0,Hi Alex! Do we need to give a test to get the Google certification or just complete the 6 months coursework?
9RRQtNnq3s0,Also how is simplilearn and edureka platforms?
9RRQtNnq3s0,As per the knowledge which one is better?
9RRQtNnq3s0,I am really curious what your thoughts are on the Google Certificate a year later now that the whole program is out
9RRQtNnq3s0,This supporting comments below..
9RRQtNnq3s0,"DON'T RISK USING COURSERA If you have any problems with the payment, you can't reach them, my card expired so charged declined, updated my card but NO WAY TO PAY the due amount, they completely deleted ALL OF THE PROGRESS I had made. Wasted so much time, I was almost finished. I was on the coursera plus subscription for the GOOGLE PROJECT MANAGEMENT COURSE BEWARE, don't risk it!!!"
9RRQtNnq3s0,Jalapenos
9RRQtNnq3s0,i prefer animation type of video
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thank you so much for this Alex!!!
9RRQtNnq3s0,i love google...Google should make there own university if they are going to make there own online courses...new subscriber
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Don't make a dicision IBM is too good
But lacking a few additional points

If you can learn python after Google
Then
You can also learn extras of Google afterwards.

But but Google recommendation to relevant is a plus for a learner!

I am doing IBM due to Python!!! Allinone!
IBM+Google is a wish dude 😎!"
9RRQtNnq3s0,"Hi, Alex, I've completed Google Data analyst course yesterday. I need your help on a case study. Is it possible to help me please?
👋"
9RRQtNnq3s0,😭we should tell his wife about Sally
9RRQtNnq3s0,What is the cost for each one?
9RRQtNnq3s0,Great video! I'm transitioning from tech writing to data analytics. Question. Is there merit to getting BOTH of these certifications?
9RRQtNnq3s0,Sally doesn't know you. You are just a pervert. haha
9RRQtNnq3s0,please do google provide the means to download all the tools you need after registration? Or you need to have the apps installed before you register? A response will highly be appreciated.
9RRQtNnq3s0,Thanks for the advice
qewHAdfzLOw,"The recipes are all different variations on ""beef"""
qewHAdfzLOw,"alex seems like the ""victim"" type. you know those that act like they don't know what's going on and boohoo poor them, while knowing exactly what they did to merit what came to them. Shameless types"
qewHAdfzLOw,Ngl I love how candid you are lol
qewHAdfzLOw,Question do they pay you well?
qewHAdfzLOw,"I love coding so much more than math
But I chose the wrong degree 
And now I have a bachelors in mathematics 
I am so lost rn"
qewHAdfzLOw,are their r communities on R? such as?
qewHAdfzLOw,My last company gave us subscriptions to Coursera (we had to apply). I was able to learn how to code through it which helped me in my then job. My current company gives each manager a training budget so I could take courses as long as they make sense for my job/job prospects within the company.
qewHAdfzLOw,"He said learn on employer's time, not dime. Actually, employers love to pay for certificates, they will probably not pay for a degree even if you could attend in the evenings"
qewHAdfzLOw,"He s right, a typical data analyst will have a business degree and experience in less technical and more business/finance areas."
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hey Alex, very informative video. I'm interested in data science and am currently choosing between online DS master degrees in Australia (coming from a bachelor degree in agribusiness). One is a year longer to complete but seems very thorough. The other is a bit light on for stats and python but is shorter and cheaper. I could use the extra time/money to learn more advanced stats/get online certs/work on GitHub projects. If I'm willing to put in the effort in my own time do you think a weaker degree is likely to prove a drawback? I'm imagining I would start out in analytics either way"
qewHAdfzLOw,Love it!!
qewHAdfzLOw,"I love that Ken is wearing a houseplant hat throughout the video. That's a nice juxtaposition of foreground and background in Alex's frame. And actually, more visually pleasing than Ken's weird off-topic clips within his own video."
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hey Alex, I love your video! Can I connect with you on Link_edIn? I'm a cs junior at UIUC and I am currently exploring both data analyst and scientists roles. If you are convenient, It would be great If I can occasionally ask you a few short questions!"
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hi, I didn't know that employers dont invest on their resource knowledge leverage or fund them to re-skill that is not the case where I work so that amaze me, I can't tell where is it or their social media studio robot will pop the alarm and will look at my other comments as well but if you want to get a certificate is very common to get a voucher and time and if you fail one time they also cover it, so is good to know Im in a good place to start my career shift. Thanks for your videos"
qewHAdfzLOw,I disagree with employers not paying. If u are at a fortune 500; I've found this is the norm. My first company paid for my entire masters.
qewHAdfzLOw,The legendary nerd beef xD
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hi Alex, your video tutorials are pretty much awesome. I want to you personal chat, regarding data analyst career, Can you share your email please."
qewHAdfzLOw,"It's jarring as a new viewer to hear you harp so much on jobs not paying to upskill their employees as I just watched one of your videos yesterday highlighting tuition reimbursement as a benefit to keep an eye out for when applying.
_________
If you're going to position yourself as above drama, then... be above it... You don't actually get points for claiming to be above drama and having no issues with someone, when you actively engage in with what you believe to be drama and spend a whole video being passive aggressive.

This contention definitely feels like a thinly veiled attempt at driving engagement. Which is kind of sad but on brand for 2021 influencer culture. 

It was just weird to hear you say you love this guy like a brother and have no issue with him, and then in the very next breath say that he stole a video topic that you had not yet published - with a straight face. It was surprisingly accurate foreshadowing of the next eleven and a half minutes of judging his tabs, his video editing, and... his pull ups...

Not sure if yall see the Google Certificate as something that will significantly expand your niches viewership and are now trying to claim the biggest share of new viewers, but if so, I guarantee you aggy videos like this aren't going to keep viewers coming back. Fix it."
qewHAdfzLOw,I would like to know how I  could get my first job as a data analyst. Thanks a lot!
qewHAdfzLOw,Are there any Data Analysts professional associations out there that you would recommend?
qewHAdfzLOw,"dear my teacher Alex, thank you for all, I am watching your channel through auto subtitle.although I live middle east I learn data Thanks to you my Teacher"
qewHAdfzLOw,Yall two box. Lol jk
qewHAdfzLOw,I just started a master in big data and data science and your videos have been so useful!
qewHAdfzLOw,HAHA if this beef is real or fake I don’t care keep it going! I’m a fan of both of you two I think this would make funny a$$ content I’m for it!
qewHAdfzLOw,I'm wondering wich one would be easier to work remote from one country to another. Great vid 👍🏼
qewHAdfzLOw,Does that mean beef is now cooked and eaten?
qewHAdfzLOw,"Your beef with Ken Jee is “well done.”  🥩 

I’m subscribing to Ken Jee’s channel now and searching for him on LinkedIn. But don’t worry, I will still watch all your videos! 😃"
qewHAdfzLOw,Who liked this video before even watching it? 🖐🏾
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hi Alex, 
Thanks for all your videos, they've been super helpful!
I'm a nursing student who wants to eventually work as a data analyst. (Nursing isn't really my thing) what jobs/online courses do you recommend I get to boost my resume in this area? Also, how are job prospectsas a health data analyst?

Thanks!"
qewHAdfzLOw,😂 Data beef.
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hi, Alex. I have a question, may be off topic, sorry. How much statistics do I need to be a data analyst? Thank you."
qewHAdfzLOw,I've been wanting to hear about this topic for a while. Thank you!
qewHAdfzLOw,thanks I'm from Tunisia I really like your content
qewHAdfzLOw,"Data Professional's drama, that's gonna be good for ratings. 😂😂😂
2:57 and what's up with these moldy oranges?"
qewHAdfzLOw,"Love the insights and this reaction video was fun to watch, maybe we need a Ken reacting to Alex's reactions to Ken's video 😆"
qewHAdfzLOw,"The poorly defined roles is such a true statement. Some jobs I've looked at turned out to be full software development with minor emphasis on stats. Some data analytics roles turn out to be business intelligence that is meant to look at the flow of data. I've been working towards being more statistically minded with some coding ability, as I'm highly interested in the outcome than the process."
qewHAdfzLOw,Oh goooood. I was waiting for this one to come out. It's like a music collaboration. I love it
qewHAdfzLOw,"Thank you, Alex, for your great work, I really enjoy the content on your channel
Could you please do a video with the   data cleaning techniques?
It would be super helpful!"
qewHAdfzLOw,“He’s literally flexing on us”....😂😂😂
qewHAdfzLOw,"He pre-Stole your video, that's beef! Don't go easy on him! 🥴"
qewHAdfzLOw,Am I the only one who gets the vibes that this man has a pure and untainted heart.
qewHAdfzLOw,That's nice! Keep it going guys
qewHAdfzLOw,"Hey Alex, I have a question. What's a good path to go to Data Engineer? I have researched it a bit, and it looks like many have taken the Data Analyst to Data Engineer path. I just don't see much information on that path. But there is a ton of information on the Data Analyst career path or Data Science career path. Thanks."
qewHAdfzLOw,"Maybe I'm just spoiled. I thought tuition reimbursement was fairly standard at larger companies. We got $4k/year at my last company.

(Also, hilarious. I totally look at the things people weren't intending to show too. Bookmarks, in this case.)"
qewHAdfzLOw,Plz Let the video you are playing be at the main video and your reaction video be at the left bottom corner so we can see what you are reacting to thank you
qewHAdfzLOw,"The next multimillion YouTube boxing match: Alex vs Ken

qewHAdfzLOw,Informative Video and great insights Alex!!

bHssBHfHWmU,Is this same as now we are in 2025
bHssBHfHWmU,Hi Alex! Thanks for this video! I was wondering if you think in today’s world 16gb is enough? It’s what I have but I need to buy a new laptop and I’m torn. I use Tableau/Powerbi/salesforce and often find that browsers use the most memory at the minute. Thank you!
bHssBHfHWmU,"Hi Alex, thanks a lot for what you do for the community. I want to ask, is it advisable to get a MacBook as a data analyst? I understand that windows pc have more integration for tools like powerBI, SQL and python. Is there a way I can get around these using my MacBook so I don't have to buy a windows pc. 

Thank you 🙏🏽"

I am just starting my journy at learning skills in data analytics but I found my pc performances not compatible (4gb RAM and 1.5ghz Processor) with core i5. I can't upgrade the processor, but maybe the RAM. Anyone thinks this would be enough to get my pc ready for data analytics tools? I couldn't install and run SQLite to give you an idea about the situation. Thanks!"
bHssBHfHWmU,Why didn’t you mention iCloud storage as a viable option?
bHssBHfHWmU,Any chance of getting an update to your recommendations on laptops for 2023?  I am looking to upgrade my laptop and would LOVE your top picks.
bHssBHfHWmU,I’ve always had not so good experience with hp. How do you like it so far? Would you still recommend it?
bHssBHfHWmU,is mac m1 air base model ok for data analytics? the only con I'm able to find out is power bi.
bHssBHfHWmU,Should I avoid using a MacBook then? It’s what I have currently. I’m in the process of switching careers to data analytics.
bHssBHfHWmU,Hi I'm a subscriber to your channel do you have an apprentice course or something....I'm studying data analytics in college...And do recomend microsoft surface 5 for Data Analytics
bHssBHfHWmU,"Will my Lenovo T450s do? 16gb RAM, 256gb SSD hard drive core i7 and 2.67ghz???"
bHssBHfHWmU,Do you think graphic cards are important for data analysis?
bHssBHfHWmU,These laptops are expensive 😂😂
bHssBHfHWmU,"and also. Lenovo yoga 7, 16 gb 1tb ssd .."
bHssBHfHWmU,"thanks for the information it was really useful, but can I ask what about Mac M1 256gb ? or Mac 2 256gb , is it good for  data analyst ?"
bHssBHfHWmU,"The first one was not new, but renewed."
bHssBHfHWmU,"looking at the recommended screen size, processors, and RAM. than a gaming laptop would be very good right? :)"
bHssBHfHWmU,"Few days i’ve been considering about buying a laptop and doing some research on the marketplace.

My option 1 - Lenovo ideapad slim 5 (Amd Ryzen 7, 16gb ram, 512ssd)

Option 2 - MSI Modern 14 (Intel Core i5, 16ram, 512ssd) or MSI Thin (Intel Core i5, 16ram, 1tb ssd)

Option 3 - Asus Vivobook Pro 14x (Ryzen 7, 16gb ram, 512ssd) or Asus Vivobook S15 (Intel Core i7, 16gb ram, 512ssd)

I also considering the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5, which is Convertible. It has Ryzen 7, 16gb of ram, and 512ssd, honestly i really like the design also Amd is much cheaper than Intel😂 But is it enough to use for learning Data Analyst? Enlighten me please😭"
bHssBHfHWmU,Jonny sins
bHssBHfHWmU,"I'm using Linux (Arch), but I figured it is more fit for data science, i'm wondering if anyone use Linux for visualization"
bHssBHfHWmU,..
bHssBHfHWmU,"Greetings Alex! First off, I want to say how much your vid’s have helped me throughout my carrier path and I appreciate what you do. So the reason I’m writing you this is to get your professional advice. I’m a student of Data analytics and I just finished the course and I’m currently on the verge to start on the coaching process. They are recommending that I use 16 Ram and what I have is 8 Ram, Can I work with it on the long run. And also I brought a new laptop that had windows 11 but wasn’t compatible because it works only with windows 10. Any opinion?!"
bHssBHfHWmU,"I'm 42, a total noob, looking to self-learn IT, with a focus on hacking ARM and Networks. My budget is $200 firm. What phone, laptop OS and language would you recommend?"
bHssBHfHWmU,"An SSD is great for speed but they are just a big flash drive that has a life span determined but the quantity of read / writes, so it's better to have an conventional HDD for long term backup. You can get free software to monitor how much life an SD has before failure. For a laptop an external HDD to back up to works well for my. While in my desktop I have both with storage for things not used daily and a partition for scheduled backup of the main SSD."
bHssBHfHWmU,"I would like to add that you shouldn't suggest laptop which have an U in the processor series. The reason stand that the U is an indicator that CPU has been drafted for users Customer, so it's not professional, because the performance it's peaked for the target : normal users, peoples.
If you have to work, do not buy a laptop with ""U"" letter in cpu."
bHssBHfHWmU,i am now looking for laptop to start learning about data analyst and its confusing. this video helps me. thanks!
bHssBHfHWmU,Why am I told by the professor to get a MacBook Pro? I prefer windows but they seemed to be leading me towards that. Also does anyone have a course/boot camp they recommend?
bHssBHfHWmU,Do you have any update for this video ? or this video still relevant for 2023?
bHssBHfHWmU,"Is this video still relevant for 2023 ? Do you have any update video.

I am usually use power bi, sql dan python for work, do you have any laptop recomendations in 2023 ? 

Hopefully you can answer. Thanknyou"
bHssBHfHWmU,What about graphics?
bHssBHfHWmU,You forgot to mention that a ryzen processor is about 70% faster on  excel than an Intel of similar range
bHssBHfHWmU,"Because I use my laptop to run VMWAre Workstation Pro to run CiscoCML and my data science apps.  I need 128Gb of RAM, as the base.  Cisco CML uses a lot of RAM and CPU, so I need a good 12th Gen CPU.  I need a good NVidia card, which is used to ML/DL use cases.  For install all the software, i need at least 2 Gb of HDD storage.  For these purposes, I find these requirements cost about 5K right now.  Yipes.  But thats what my dual purpose DS/ Cisco CML/ EVE-NG sim cost."
bHssBHfHWmU,"I have a Mac M1 16GB ram 
I’ve been using windows for 15+ years so it took a bit getting used to 

I love the build quality of MacBooks but i do miss windows. I will say Windows glitches out and has more hiccups than MacOS. But I miss the little features"
bHssBHfHWmU,Might be a good time for an update for 2023 🎉 happy new year!
bHssBHfHWmU,"I only disagree with you on the importance of a full keyboard w a 10 key. any DS should have easy access to the number keypad.  I work mainly from home, and I want to use this (Envy 15.6"") for a desktop monitor eventually.  I have been wanting to stick w HP but my Envy has an issue with screen blackout at random times, mostly when I have a split screen.  But as it is almost 2023, I am going to check out the Omen to see if there are any configurations that I prefer.  I am looking for 1T, 16GB, i7 or AMD Ryzan 7, 17"" screen size with a full keyboard.  Any thoughts would be awesome! Thank you as always Alex!!! You rock!!"
bHssBHfHWmU,Yhank you
bHssBHfHWmU,The amt of time u gave storage is wierd.1 Tb hdd  plus 512 SSD should be good. Analyst open several files at a time RAM plus high processor speed and no of core will make all the difference
bHssBHfHWmU,"One thing that I really like about reviews, is follow up reviews of the product. People cannot get a good reaction out of a product, unless it has undergone a period of time, in which its' been put through its' paces. 

I would really appreciate a review of this product after the laptop has seen it's 3rd anniversary of operation."
bHssBHfHWmU,"I like all your videos, but this one missing very  important information. The specs you mentioned are very generic and not accurate. For example, in RAMs other than GB, it is important to be DR4 not the older types (DDR 3 and...). Higher GB  in RAM, and higher core i number in CPU DON'T prove a better performance, especially in CPU and RAM. Thank you for sharing the videos. I've learned a lot, especially the data analyst videos."
bHssBHfHWmU,"Hey Alex, im a mac user for 15+ years and been upskilling in data analysis in recent months and been using a mid tier windows, which I have enjoyed with its compatibility, many ports etc. but the screen and battery life just don’t compare to my mac. How would you rate omen’s screen and battery life? Thank you!"
bHssBHfHWmU,My MacBook Pro hasn’t been compatible with my new Data journey so this video is helpful
bHssBHfHWmU,My MacBook Pro hasn’t been compatible with my new Data journey so this video is helpful
bHssBHfHWmU,Question: why do I need a new laptop when I can use cloud services. Thinking out loud …😊
bHssBHfHWmU,"Hi Alex
16Gb ram & 512 SSD & i7 12 gen is enough for data analyst??"
bHssBHfHWmU,"Hi Alex, great video! I was hoping you will talk about Mac but you didn't. That said, would you recommend Mac for a beginner data analyst?"
bHssBHfHWmU,Thanks Alex
bHssBHfHWmU,thank you so much for explaining all the specifications. Now I actually know what I want in a laptop. You made it so easy and clear for a nuby like me !
bHssBHfHWmU,You didnt get to talk about batter life
bHssBHfHWmU,"Can I just Alex, you are the MAN! You literally have a video for every question I have! Thank you so much!!! 🙌🏾"
bHssBHfHWmU,Is 12GB Memory enough for analyst work
bHssBHfHWmU,@Alex The Analyst does the dual-core vs quad-core processors have a big impact? For data science purposes...
bHssBHfHWmU,Anyway who loves his glasses😚
bHssBHfHWmU,Thank you for such a a clear explanation!
bHssBHfHWmU,"It seems whenever I'm confused about a thing concerning data analytics and i open my YT app, boom Alex is there with the solution. 
Thanks alot for this video"
bHssBHfHWmU,"i use a very old laptop Dell Inspiron 15.5"" 7000 series with core-i5-6300HQ with 8GB of Ram with 256GB SSD and 1TB of HDD, should I change it or this is good enough? which is better between windows and Mac?"
bHssBHfHWmU,"Can you please tell me why you didn't include Apple?
Aren't they okay for DS?
Can you please explain.
I love Omen, Legion and xps though."
bHssBHfHWmU,Okay so we're supposed to assume that the Intel Core i3-12300 is worse than the i5 6200u and the i7 2600? Why do people act like the only cpu number that matters is the generation?
bHssBHfHWmU,Talks about processor generation but doesn't mention processor speed.
bHssBHfHWmU,Will a laptop with 12gb ram and r5 5500u be good enough for Honours level data analysis works?
bHssBHfHWmU,Great Info!!! Thanks!!!
bHssBHfHWmU,8 inch mach book pro :D hahahah
bHssBHfHWmU,"I do lots of Marketing Analytics and Financials in excel. I batch massive workbooks in excel. It takes forever to calculate mega workbooks. I got i7 16gb ram Samsung NVME ssd. Ableton 50 tracks 96k24 / Photoshop multi layers, filters, rendering / Starcraft II High settings 30-40 FPS etc run fine. What’s the best laptop to speed up workbook calc? Where do I find 2022 excel mega workbook benchmarks comparison? I want the fastest possible excel mega workbook calc performance in laptop, $3000-$4000 budget.

I have tried undervoluing, changing P-STates / C-States, repasting, Windows profile provisioning, regen hacking, DPC optimization, custom cooling, etc with significant gaming / photoshop / daw performance gains (10-35%), but barley marginal 3-5% performance gain on workbook calc. 

I can work on about 10,000 rows are fast, but my 30k row workbook projects are bit laggy, and my 60k+ row workbooks are exceptionally laggy.

Is my best option to NUK a Dual Xeon in a briefcase with CAT5 Virtual desktop via laptop controller Winpro?

Halp!"
bHssBHfHWmU,"My experience with plastic body laptops is not good. Most of the time, they are causing to break the laptop screen."
bHssBHfHWmU,AMD H processor is more powerful than AMD U
bHssBHfHWmU,"Hello there, I’m an entry level data analyst, with so much as little knowledge only, could anyone lemme know if chrome books a good choice to learn data analysis."
bHssBHfHWmU,"I noticed there is no Mac reccommendations, any reason?"
bHssBHfHWmU,"Hello alex , do you have a new update for this video ?"
bHssBHfHWmU,I smiled all through this video. Thank you 😊 Alex
bHssBHfHWmU,Always go for SDD - Once you go for ssd you will never turn back for hdd
bHssBHfHWmU,we need quantom computing power :D
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hey, what's your opinion on mathematics for machine learning and data science by deep learning"
A4OVjWeVb10,thank you so much 🧡💚❤💙
A4OVjWeVb10,Coursera is only given 7 days trial for the machine learning by Andrew Ng. What should I do?
A4OVjWeVb10,The courses are not free anymore 🥲
A4OVjWeVb10,"as software engineer, I think it is the best time for me to jump into machine learning"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Can i get work in company after finish Andrew ng ???
And what next step after finih Andrew ng course"
A4OVjWeVb10,"I’m currently doing the Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization and let me say

If I wasn’t doing my undergraduate in mathematics i would have a really hard time with this course. 
Also having Python experience is definitely a prerequisite to the course. It gets tough."
A4OVjWeVb10,"Thanks for this Alex, it's all been added to my 'to learn' list :)"
A4OVjWeVb10,"As much as I admire Andrew Ng, his machine learning course uses Octave instead of Python which was the reason I decided not to take his course. It's a bit outdated being 11 years old, but I'm sure the basics are still relevant."
A4OVjWeVb10,Is the math course required? I’m in a masters program and the math is just so dry I want to code
A4OVjWeVb10,Dude did you really take all those classes!!?? Kudos to you man
A4OVjWeVb10,"Practically, how well do Andrew Ng's courses (including Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specialization) prepare one for a data science role? I love the courses, I just don't know how they compare to the dat-to-day of a data scientist."
A4OVjWeVb10,Can a 18 year student can also enroll and study the machine learning course by andrew ng offered by stanford?
A4OVjWeVb10,Is ML difficult than DS?
A4OVjWeVb10,hey a very insightful content ! i just have a question can you tell a little about what specific courses to go for in machine learning if you are looking to learn machine learning for data analysis and data predictions and not that for computer vision ? (i hope i am making sense apologies if not)
A4OVjWeVb10,"1. Watched one video from the YouTube recommendation.
2. Subscribed the channel.
3. Watched videos in a row.😁"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hello Alex,
Hope you and your family are fine and safe.
Could you please make a video on some Best Data Science, Machine / Deep Learning courses on Udemy?"
A4OVjWeVb10,I discovered this channel 2 days after moving out of DFW 😂😂
A4OVjWeVb10,I’m planning on buying the Mac book air for the google data analytics certificate. Would I be able to run everything probably?
A4OVjWeVb10,"I had one question Alex, "" What is metrics in data?""
I am not understanding this, can you please explain it if possible with a small example."
A4OVjWeVb10,Can you make a video about best course on Coursera about API
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hey Alex, this might be random, but what is Maxs' breed? I'm looking to buy a dog and he is so cute."
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hi Alex, I prefer your videos when It's not a promotion of Coursera, just my opinion. Have a good day"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hi Alex- learning so much from your channel
If I’m looking to actual graduate degree programs, and interested in data analyst- is that going to be found more in the data science section like ms or ma business analytics? Usually there hasn’t really been a ms in data analytics
If looking to get an actual degree what is the best title to look for within data analytics
Thanks in advance"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hi Alex, thank you for your videos.
Not a related topic, I noticed Coursera IPO is on 31 March."
A4OVjWeVb10,"Hello Alex,

Can you please compare between alteryx designer expert certification and google data analytics certification??"
A4OVjWeVb10,Please make a video on best courses for data science🙏🏻
A4OVjWeVb10,I’ve started google data analytics course after watching your video
A4OVjWeVb10,What are some good resources/courses for learning cloud services?
A4OVjWeVb10,I don't think this list is complete without the Deep Learning and Neural Nets course by Andrew Ng.. Outstanding educator he is..
A4OVjWeVb10,"I took the Google Data Analytics trial, but didn’t really like how it was mostly someone talking to a screen most of the time. It wasn’t very engaging for me since I’m a visual learner. Do other courses on Coursera have more visuals/real-time examples like Udemy does?"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Can you suggest some course on NLP , chat bot courses on coursera?"
A4OVjWeVb10,What is the difference between machine learning and data science ? Are they both one and same ? Or machine learning an advanced level of data science ?
A4OVjWeVb10,Andrew Ng is the man!  Didn't realize that Coursera had his course!  🤯 Thanks for sharing this Alex!!!
A4OVjWeVb10,"Only after doing some Machine Learning projects, I now understand the importance of Data Cleaning. No Clean data No Machine Learning. 

DataCamp is awesome, especially their projects section for Machine Learning is a gold mine. I badly wanted to do Andrew NG's ML course in Coursera but too bad its not implemented in Python :("
A4OVjWeVb10,I’ve been thinking about Machine Learning lately. I’m glad you did this video. Why did you decide Data Science wasn’t for you?
A4OVjWeVb10,Thanks for your videos!
A4OVjWeVb10,"for the video, I understand that you took the 5 courses. Do you feel that you got enough, did you feel ready to break as data scientist?, why did you pull back and decided that data science is not for you?"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Would you say the skills one would learn from as a Data Analyst are transferable to Machine Learning? I'll be starting a Data Analysis BSc. this year, wondering what kind of careers might additionally be available to me."
A4OVjWeVb10,"Alex you did it again 🙂, another amazing video 🤩. I’m going to check those courses with Web 3.0 coming ML will play a big part and I don’t want to be left behind 🙂"
A4OVjWeVb10,"Additional course I think is IBM Machine Learning because I think with those kind of courses covered a lot of basic machine learning, deep learning and time series too compared with IBM AI Application, I have take this and IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and I think it is worth it for learning."
A4OVjWeVb10,"Nice buddy, you helped a lot. 
Keep going!!"
A4OVjWeVb10,"I would like to include IBM machine learning. I have taken that and would say that is also an excellent course. It contains machine leaning and deep learning as every other course. The unique feature of this is, it deals with Time series forecasting and even helped me complete a project I was working on."
SIseim20_Dc,"10:56 

Now we are 5 years into the future, do you think AI is now capable of grasping the domain knowledge easily?"
SIseim20_Dc,this just made me want an omelette haha
SIseim20_Dc,"Hahah i love how natural your uncut show with you pausing/forgetting what you're talking about to picking up your cute dog - makes you more human and relatable = ]

If i was to be a data analyst i want to work with hospital and doctors too , because i am passionate about helping ppl with their health, especially making an impact on the healthcare/hospital industry.  Is the job title in that industry, called healthcare analyst??"
SIseim20_Dc,Cauliflower
SIseim20_Dc,When he said 'I think I stopped watching. I will be laughing in 10 years when all these clowns are out of work!
SIseim20_Dc,I never skip a single ads to appreciate this man
SIseim20_Dc,"I think we are underestimating ourselves just because we believe the fact that calculators can do better difficult math than human ... Even people know this fact ... But human emotions , sentiments , though processes can never be replaced and this job indeed require that ... Improving soft skills will be key in future"
SIseim20_Dc,"I’ve never yet come across a profession where the practitioners think their job can automated.

Until it happens."
SIseim20_Dc,🥦
SIseim20_Dc,"I actually like eating cauliflower, and thank you for speaking to us the audience."
SIseim20_Dc,"I watch your videos on my cell. When I first see the Vegetable based T-shirt, I thought it's a Pickle Rick hehe"
SIseim20_Dc,I love cauliflower pizza or pasta!
SIseim20_Dc,"Hello Alex, is it true that we need to learn DAX for Power BI ??? How different is it with R or Python? Is DAX a must learn??"
SIseim20_Dc,As long as excel continues to turn my dates to numbers...I don't think we need to worry about automating analytics...data engineering or software
SIseim20_Dc,Which breed is Max?😍
SIseim20_Dc,"Alex, could you give make a video of an introduction to azure?"
SIseim20_Dc,for context and logical deductions... what about AI?
SIseim20_Dc,Sir How about holding a MSc in data analytics and launching my career in the field of data analytics?
SIseim20_Dc,"You and cauliflower are teaching me English vocab for vegetables quite well! I had no idea what that is despite really liking it xD

Btw, there's one other and very big thing that people often forget to take into account. Machines glitch. They glitch a lot. No matter how good your IT department is.

For example, where I currently work as an intern we have a lot of standartised reports automated. Analysts basically just need to prepare the data to fit a specific template, and then the robots can prepare all the reports for us. However, with every new update to the report templates and/or the robots there are inevitably a bunch of new bugs, including robots preparing certain reports incorrectly or refusing to prepare them at all. And sure, sooner or later the tech guys are going to fix it (until something new breaks, at least), but when push comes to shove and our deadlines are close (which they constantly are), it is up to the analysts to actually do everything by hand until the robots get fixed. And that's why, despite all the automatisation, we're still needed at the job."
SIseim20_Dc,"I had one question Alex, "" What is metrics in data?""
I am not understanding this, can you please explain it if possible with a small example."
SIseim20_Dc,"So a question about the Automation of Data Analysis (Edit: And about the future of Data Analysis as a career in general): 

Like I commented under another of your videos, I'm trying to find a different career path to get out of being an electrician. Data Analysis really seem like it might be what I will be going for in the very near future. My question now is, considering the maybe/maybe not automation of the job in the future do you think it would be worth it to get into the industry? And do you think that in the future with automation ramping up the will be as good money wise as it is right now? I'm currently 24 and depending on how much money I make I plan to work until I am at least 60. The thing is that I don't know that much about the industry and want to prevent myself from entering a possible career path that wouldn't last me as long. Granted, if I work as a Data Analyst for such a long time I might find opportunities to branch of into a different direction, but right now I'm solely looking at the case of me doing the same job / going the same direction until I retire.

Thank you for your videos. I'm quite new to the channel and the world of data analysis, but you have already given me quite a bit of insight."
SIseim20_Dc,"Hey, man. Thank you so much for your channel; all the time, the thoughtfulness- it’s been very meaningful."
SIseim20_Dc,Is AWS required for Data analyst job?
SIseim20_Dc,"PAM?!? No!!!! Research the harmful effects of bad oils, its like hands down one of the worst things you can eat. Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, grass fed butter...all far better options.  Thanks for all the info you share, really learning a lot. And I love cauliflower :)"
SIseim20_Dc,Do you have any insight on the difference between a Data Analyst in the Healthcare field vs. a Health informatician?
SIseim20_Dc,can we automate the Q/A session for a specific day :D i'm always missing it
SIseim20_Dc,"Hi Alex, do you think we should consider learning tools like STAT and SPSS?"
SIseim20_Dc,"Please tell me which DA certifications is best for financial analyst roles,I'm doing an MBA international business and can only take out time for one score.
Please refer to me which course has the highest recognition and best knowledge base"
SIseim20_Dc,"BTW, it's your fault. English has limited capacity of describing cooking. When I try to describe how a dish is done, it's always Chinese/French vocabularies that come up my mind."
SIseim20_Dc,"Nice talk, Alex! Dank u wel! What kind of healthcare data have you been dealing with, may I ask? I'm interested in a few kinds of health data and wondering where they are."
SIseim20_Dc,So how do Data Analyst stay on top of the automation in the analytics fields. What can we learn of top of what we know to keep up?
SIseim20_Dc,"First of all, cauliflower.
I love your content and how you inspire a lot of young people (just like me) to schedule their data analysis learning process.
Keep it up!"
SIseim20_Dc,cauliflower
SIseim20_Dc,"I'm thinking about my job and how complex the business is and I'm not sure AI can fully replace what I do. Our business has 1000s of tables with complex relationships that are very complex in nature. Our orders table, for example,  has billions of records with information on taxing, discounts, products etc... that all relate to other objects. I'm starting to think about all the views and tables we create for reporting needs and all the complex logic and SQL that goes into creating these views and I just don't see how that can be fully automated without a human being involved. Can the AI and human work together. Sure, but the AI on its own doesn't sound like it can work. After the data has been massaged and transformed there are so many ways to interpret the results that you couldn't possibly rely on just AI for that without human intervention. I think the two will ultimately work together and nobody has to freak out about AI replacing any jobs."
SIseim20_Dc,"I think people also confuse “Automation” with “Artificial General intelligence” which from my understanding are two very different things. 

At a certain point if a large majority of jobs get “automated” and it puts a large amount of people out of work then who will be left to actually buy stuff? 

I highly doubt all those articles about “universal income” Governments already tax the hell out of us. I can’t see them just giving a large amount of the population a decent amount of money every month."
SIseim20_Dc,"Hi Alex,
How do i connect with you on LinkedIn please?"
SIseim20_Dc,"Hello Alex,

You told you will review my resume. Can you please do it soon??"
SIseim20_Dc,Cauliflower ! Good luck with your garden this year
SIseim20_Dc,I thought Max was your child when you called him...Great looking buddy you got there!
SIseim20_Dc,4:15 goooooooooood boy
SIseim20_Dc,Cauliflower >:P
SIseim20_Dc,cauliflower !
SIseim20_Dc,now you need to try to cook Spanish Omelette. With potato ! yummy yummy !
SIseim20_Dc,According to you...what would be the education / background people in charge of the automation would have ? Thanks. Great video as usual.
SIseim20_Dc,"Forget the end of the world when Skynet murders us all, what's going to happen when you run out of vegetables??? That's the real future crisis we need to deal with."
SIseim20_Dc,"re YouTube/LinkedIn: It's way more fun to defy expectations and norms.

Also, it's not all that weird to think about the end of the ""reign"" of humans because our existence on earth's timeline is incredibly insignificant as it is. It's weirder to me to think this will be norm forever. Just my own tangent I guess hah.

(... Cauliflower.)"
SIseim20_Dc,Max 😍
SIseim20_Dc,"Enjoyed hearing your perspective on AI and Data Analytics, completely agree with your assessment.  

P.S. I prefer 🥦 over cauliflower... something about that white veggie gets me!  hahaha"
SIseim20_Dc,"""Our task is not the same all the day"" -- >  more or less,  It depends of the personality of each people and the tasks of the company. If you're not creative, you can do the same all the day and It could be borring. The exciting and difficult thing is to be creative and have new ideas to help the business (and of course using analytics skills)"
SIseim20_Dc,Great video thank you for the insight.
SIseim20_Dc,"I am agree with you, especially with AI is grown so rapidly, and yeah you don't need to worry with automation because of we have the context about data, while automation maybe can do very quick, but with context we have as a natural side of human, I think automation will help us a lot, and can be focusing more on another thing."
SIseim20_Dc,"So many people from the Google Data Analysis Certificate found out about it from you, and they're not all from the States.
Keep up the good work."
SIseim20_Dc,How are you Alex? What do you think about google cloud badges? And if i didn't comment lately does not mean i didn't watch your videos. cauliflower
SIseim20_Dc,Alex how are you doing today?
SIseim20_Dc,"""...I think the end of the world is... somewhat important."""
SIseim20_Dc,"Hi Alex, great video! I wouldn’t call you harsh or critical on LinkedIn. I think you just found a funny way of expressing yourself there. It’s all in good fun. I did enjoy watching your R vs. Python thing go viral. I noticed you referenced it in your Google Data Analytics video. It gave me a good laugh.

Did you study much Machine Learning? Do you enjoy working with it? Do you see yourself trying it out more in the future?"
SIseim20_Dc,"This is why now I switched focusing on data analytics from data science because if all you do is feature engineer & making models, AutoML is already in the market, while data analytics focused on data inferential w/ domain synergy.






























Oh and also Julia > R + Python"

SIseim20_Dc,"Ten years really isn't a very long time. And of course, as I said before, there will be more people with these skills than ever. I feel like I should have gone to school to become a nurse or something, did that for a few years, and then the career options would have been better. The domain knowledge seems like the key."
SIseim20_Dc,Can you please make a video regarding the career path of data analyst as they gain experience

NrBJmtD0kEw,"gilt nicht für oracle SQL, nur für MS! 😞"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Oh my god thank you so much for just getting right to the point in your video 😂 finally someone gets it 😂
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Remarkable how much content there is in here, digestible, and usable.  Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Why not simply use HeidiSQL?
NrBJmtD0kEw,i really loved The Office names in DB hahahah
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I don't understand
Why would we want to use Stored Procedures over VIEWS or Functions?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I appreciate the work you've put into these tutorials; I get a strong impression that you really know what you're doing. However, the learning experience with this particular video...just didn't feel good. On the one hand, during grad a school a professor once told me that in grad school I'm learning how to learn, so I understand that there will be times when I'll just have to go out of my way to fill in the gaps when trying to learn something from someone (like an instructor) or something (like a textbook). On the other hand...it feels like there were a LOT of gaps to fill in with this video, and during the lesson I wasn't sure what I was supposed to look up to fill in those gaps. 

Maybe it's because I'm using a different version of software than what was used in the video, or maybe our applications had been configured differenlty, but I just could not create the stored procedure based off of the SQL code in the video, and it wasn't until after I had seen the code on GitHub that I finally could. Moreover, I had to figure out how to open up a new tab to modify the stored procedure because I couldn't tell how you had done it in the video, and then after that I had to figure out how to commit the changes that I had made to the stored procedure. 

After having finished the video, I did a search for the keyword 'GO' since I had to use that to create the stored procedure, and I thought, ""Oh...okay. That...kinda makes sense."" And then I did a search on how to create a stored procedure in SQL, and then I finally thought, ""Oh! That makes sense!"" It's like...everything from 'CREATE PROCEDURE' all the way up to 'GO' inclusive was one big transaction (or a collection of SQL statements that I have to be performed all together as one atomic unit). Moreover, the semi-colon ( ; ) doesn't seem to be necessary when coding in T-SQL, but explicitly typing that character out makes it clear (at least to me) where a statement or transaction is intended to terminate. 

So once again, thank you for your effort to explain these concepts. You really do seem to be very knowledgeable on the material. I'm just concerned that key details are being inadvertently omitted because they seem like second nature to you as a function of your years of experience. Take care."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Bro... you take the time to make videos and put them on YouTube, but you can't be bothered to do a basic mic check before you start filming... kind of lazy bro. Audio quality is total shite. It's like reverse ASMR and highly irritating. Sounds like you just used the built in mic on your laptop WHILE you're typing on it... what the fuck"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Thank you for making this video.
I understood what SP is in this tutorial.
Just little bit."
NrBJmtD0kEw,grate channel but am having trouble refreshing in stored procedures it very convincing
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I dont understand the part where you say “you don’t have to put the @Jobtitle right here. You can put it wherever you want”, like where? How would that look?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,I’m actually taking a data analytics boot camp and they’ll show us a super simple example like your first one here and your videos are helping me keep my head above water. The way you explain is actually retainable. I think I’m going to start your course after this one so that I actually know what I’m doing 🙏🏽
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thanks a lot.
NrBJmtD0kEw,how  did you do the refreshing?
NrBJmtD0kEw,ALTER PROCEDURE is not permitted in store procedure.
NrBJmtD0kEw,"what would happen if the parameter @jobtitle already has a default value like where jobtitle ='manager' then we excuuted the procedure like exce temp_employee @jobtitle = 'sales man' does it keep its old value or updates to the new one?
thanks in advance"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I  was mid-training and i lost the training video threads for SSMS its only My SQL now, can anyone help with redirecting ?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"After running ""EXEC Temp_Employee"" , when I refresh the stored procedure, I do not get the ""dbo.Temp_Employee "" after refreshing. 
And when I select the entire code and execute, it shows "" There is already an object named 'Temp_Employee' in the database but I can not see it anywhere. 

Any idea why it is happening??"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Thank you for creating all these great tutorials. I have followed along with all of them and have learned a lot. However, in this video, when executing the following last line:
EXEC Temp_Employee @JobTitle = 'Salesman'
My results only showed the message (1 row affected)"" without displaying the actual rows affected in the EXEC statement. Any thoughts as to why?

Either way, your tutorials are excellent. They have propelled me further than the Google Analytics Certification program has in regards to SQL. Thank you once again for your invaluable resources!"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thank you I’ve been confused on this one for ages
NrBJmtD0kEw,After modifying the temp_Employee i dont get an error it just shows me the info again. Am I missing something? I deleted and tried again multiple times. :(
NrBJmtD0kEw,When I try to insert value into #temp_employee it says invalid object name  2:33 .
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Is semicolon required to seperate these two code blocks? I see examples with semicolons on the net.
Also, on some websites, Go keyword is used at the end of stored procedure. It is also not a compulsory thing as I see."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"This is top-notch in every aspect. I read a book with similar content, and it was top-notch. ""Mastering AWS: A Software Engineers Guide"" by Nathan Vale"
NrBJmtD0kEw,I tried relating it to a function how it takes arguments and you can use argument in the function block so whatever you pass as a parameter while calling the fn will replace the values in the function.
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hello Alex, please can one get your email address? I have some questions in respect to some of the things done in the videos. If you don't mind. Thank you"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hello alex 
I'm facing a problem 
When i create a stored procedure, it does say commands completed successfully but when i refresh the stored procedures, it is still not showing 
And when i try to execute too, it gives error 
Can you help me with this error ?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hey Alex! there is any way to make other video with different example I know this is an advance video but I don't get it, is so confusing and frustrating. I feel all I did was copy and page and yeah I get the result but still lost with this, thank you"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I cannot get the store procedure to create the TEST  table! I've refreshed it over and over, recreated calling it  TEST2, even made a whole new query and could never get the same result from the video. What am I doing wrong?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I think storage procedures are like functions in (c++,python,javascript) correct me if i am wrong."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hi Alex,
Thank you so much for sharing all this  info and Kudos for owning now your own educational SQL platform. O hope this content doesn't disapper!
If i might  give you my 2 cents. i think parameter should have his own video or maybe making this one longer with a specified section for parameters.
Bye!"
NrBJmtD0kEw,So basically those are just sql templates with parameters?
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Great course but having a little issue with the stored procedures in the object explorer- even after refreshing the created procedures are not listed- what is really werid is that they run ok when executed - has anyone else had this issue? i am working with SQL server management studiio 19.2.
If you do have a solution, that would be awesome because all I can find online is ""press refresh"""
NrBJmtD0kEw,"stored procedure is the most difficult one so far, but explained very well"
NrBJmtD0kEw,When i modified mine and execute the Temp_Employee i didnt get the error message and im a dummy all  i need to do is execute the modified procedure so and now its working
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Once modified, I execute the parameter query but I get an error that states that I 'Must declare scalar variable ""@Salesman"" ' . Can anybody help ?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Clear explanation 👏👏👏👏
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hi Alex, I am stacking in the initial creation of Procedure. Making error in the code when executing it.
Its not validating to Employeedemography word, showing invalid"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hye guys, great video as always. I just wondering, why i can't find my stored procedure although i already refresh the 'Stored Procedure ' folder many times. Hope someone can help me. 🙏"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Do you have the data analyst courses in uedmy, please share it"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hi Alex, thanks for the insightful video so far.
I tried executing EXEC Temp_Employee, but the table does not come up as it should. It on shows ""Command completed successfully"".
So I'm kind of lost."
NrBJmtD0kEw,this lesson is abit hard but i will gett through it
NrBJmtD0kEw,deos anyone know why my procedure temp_employee appear in the master system database instead of in the SQLTutorial database?
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Thank you for a very informative series. Regarding the Stored Procedure modification, how do you save the modification?  Doesn't look like it auto save, and the save options will save the SQL  form and not the procedure itself."
NrBJmtD0kEw,It's funny how most SQL tutorials I've encountered use the employee names from The Office haha
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thanks buddy very informative
NrBJmtD0kEw,It was nice video and easy  to understand. Thank you so much
NrBJmtD0kEw,You have not mentioned that after modifying the stored procedure we need to execute it in order to ensure the modified stored procedure is the one that runs when we do EXEC Test_Employee
NrBJmtD0kEw,deus te abençoe
NrBJmtD0kEw,this video was a little bit complicated for me :(
NrBJmtD0kEw,I am unable to run the INSERT into #temp_employee chunk of code. I even copied and pasted from Alex' code. I receive this message - Invalid object name #temp_employee. Any ideas on what I could be doing wrong?
NrBJmtD0kEw,"ok. so immediately after creating my stored procedure, i ran into the problem of it not being in the right database even though i did everything correctly and without syntax errors. if you also have this problem, i'm writing this comment to (hopefully) help. sorry, it'll be a long read.
so! like i said my stored procedure was not in my SQL Tutorial database as intended and after some searching through my own files still nothing. i read a comment saying that someone found their stored procedure in the master database, so i checked in there and there it was! so if you haven't been able to locate your own, yours may be there. after locating it, i looked up how to move the stored procedure to the right database and the steps i followed are here with my notes in brackets:

1. Go the server in Management Studio
2. Select the database, right click on it Go to Task.
3. Select generate scripts option under Task
4. and once its started select the desired stored procedures you want to copy [for this step i chose to just open the script in a new query window so i didn't have to download a file and work more quickly, but choose the method that is best for you)


now once you have the script of the stored procedure pulled up, look to the very top at (what i guess to be) the USE statement. the database in which the stored procedure is in will be in brackets. go to the USE and change the name of the database to the one in which you want to be the location of the stored procedure. once you change the database as needed, execute the whole thing and you should be good to go! be sure to check for the location and refresh as needed to make sure everything went smoothly before moving on. please note that these steps may not be helpful if you made a typo or anything, so check your query that created the stored procedure to see where you may have an issue. i suppose in the future, for creating objects such as stored procedures and anything else that needs a location specified, placing that USE statement when you first write the query may be the best course of action. i'm still new to this so there may be better ways to do this. at any rate, i hope this helps!! :)

edit: an additional note! i learned that to specify the database location, you must use GO directly after the USE statement, otherwise you'll get an error saying that the CREATE statement must be first (not totally sure what the GO does in this case, if anyone knows please share! :) ) so when you're creating your stored procedure for the temp table, write this right before your CREATE statement: 
USE [ ]
GO

your desired database will go in the brackets of course :) then you should be good to go to continue writing your query!

edit 2: I double checked in my master database and saw i had a copy of my TEST stored procedure, so i just deleted them once i made sure i moved them to my desired database. so do with these copies as you see fit!"
NrBJmtD0kEw,where can I find the #temp_employee table you created within the procedure? I could not find it anywhere
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I was slightly struggling with it to follow along so here is the steps to actually get the same result: 
1) You write a stored procedure: drop table if exists, create table, inset into and select - finish with GO (you can also wrap the whole thing in: BEGIN (all queries) END
2) Run what you wrote (all of it)
3) Exec [store procedure name]
4) Modify - add parameter 
5) Run the whole thing again ( I mean the modify query)
6) Exec  [store procedure name] [your parameter]"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Alex you lost me at 2:33 :(
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thank you Alex. Your videos are literally the best. You came down to the beginners level and walked us from ground to top.
NrBJmtD0kEw,"After creating the procedure, it doesn't show on stored procedures."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Am I the only who could not INSERT INTO the temp employee table? I've watched the video over and over. It tells me Invalid Object name #Temp_employee when trying to run insert into, and after creating the procedure CREATE PROCE... As Create Table #Temp_employee ..... anybody?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Why is it that my stored procedures didn't result in a ""table"" but it did show that the command was successful? 
Any thoughts?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hello. Can someone explain what '@' means?  when, how and where Do we need to attached it? Thanks before."
NrBJmtD0kEw,Hey Alex great video! I was following along and wondered what the differences are when using Postgresql as I tried to run the stored procedure and it didnt work. So how would I be able to create a procedure temp table in postgre or would I just have to create a function instead?
NrBJmtD0kEw,How could I do to alter the procedure using mysql? I didn't manage to adjust the syntax.
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hello! When I create 'Stored Procedure', it is created in the Master Database, is there any way to stop this?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Love the database from The Office
NrBJmtD0kEw,Awesome! Thank you!
NrBJmtD0kEw,Great tutorial. Practicing this on azure and I keep getting this error: 'CREATE PROCEDURE' must be the only statement in the batch. I don't know what it means. Can anyone help?
NrBJmtD0kEw,"hey, thanks for sharing this video, I've did all the steps, but still after refreshing I can't able to find the Test in stored procedures, is there anything I can do to rectify."
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thanks. Nice explaination
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I typed your initial create procedures code exactly, but it gives me this message. I can't seem to figure out the issue. How would you resolve it?

Error Code: 1064. You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'AS Select* From employeedemographics' at line 2"
NrBJmtD0kEw,i have no idea what you did to execute the stored procedure lol when i exec my procedure it shows that it is somewhere on my pc its just not showing
NrBJmtD0kEw,"This has been an amazing tool to help fortify what I have already learned. My question would be what would cause the opposite to happen? I pulled the code from your GitHub, ran what you ran, and made the same changes. I did this under SQLTutorial instead of Master. Would that cause this to happen?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Thank you so much for the tutorial. I really appreciate it. I have a question. After I add a parameter to the procedure and execute the procedure again, the result is the same as the procedure without a parameter. No error or warning. It seems that my parameter didn't come into effect. What should I do? Thank you!"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Thank you so much, this video was very helpful. I think Stanley feels a little young however. 10/10"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"After you run the Temp_Employee stored procedure, where does the table #temp_employee get created? I can't see it under Tables in the db tree even after refreshing."
NrBJmtD0kEw,even i refresh the stored procedures there is no data appear in stored procedure where did the data go also i created another data temp _employee  i cant see the data in stored procedures what shoud i do?
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thanks Alex
NrBJmtD0kEw,I am following this series from beginning and now this is the first video that i find difficult to understand 😐 still learning....
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Why are my stored procedures not showing, please help. :("
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Im using Postgresql - 

I can create the following function to retrieve all the data from the EmployeeDemographics table:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test()
RETURNS TABLE (EmployeeID integer, FirstName varchar(50), LastName varchar(50), Age integer, Gender varchar(50))
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

But when I try to create a Stored procedure like this:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE TEST()
RETURNS TABLE (EmployeeID integer, FirstName varchar(50), LastName varchar(50), Age integer, Gender varchar(50))
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

It fails to execute.

ChatGPT states since I'm using Postgres:

""The code for creating a stored procedure in PostgreSQL is correct, except that in PostgreSQL, stored procedures are called functions, not procedures.""

What am I doing that is syntactically that is not allowing me to create a stored procedure in Postgres?"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hello Alex - I couldn’t modify the storage procedure because I couldn’t find it under programmability, though it executes just fine."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Hi everyone,

I created the procedure, however it is not stored in stored procedures although I refreshed it again and again but it did not work. I searched online for solution but could not find it. I would appreciate any help here."
NrBJmtD0kEw,Will you be doing Triggers at all?
NrBJmtD0kEw,"For those using SQLite, this DBMS doesn’t support Stored Procedures. For people using MySQL, the Stored Procedures is quite different. Below is the way how I did the first and second examples. Finally, there is no way to modify the parameters or the body stored procedure in MySQL, so you must drop it and create another one using DROP PROCEDURES IF EXISTS

Example 1
DELIMITER &&
CREATE PROCEDURE TEST ()
BEGIN 
SELECT * FROM Employee;
END &&
DELIMITER ;
CALL TEST;

Example 2
DELIMITER &&
CREATE PROCEDURE Test ()
BEGIN  
		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Temp_Employee;
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Temp_Employee (JobTitle VARCHAR (50), EmployeeperJob VARCHAR (50), Avg_Age INT, Avg_Salary INT );
		INSERT INTO Temp_Employee
		SELECT JobTittle, COUNT(JobTittle), AVG (Age), AVG (Salary)  
		FROM Employee emp INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary sal ON emp.EmployeeID = sal.EmployeeID
		GROUP BY JobTittle;
SELECT * FROM Temp_Employee;
END &&
DELIMITER ;
CALL Test;

EXEC is replaced by CALL here."
NrBJmtD0kEw,Stored Procedures are somewhat complex. In what context would we need to use it?
NrBJmtD0kEw,"So far partition and stored procedures are the 2 videos that I found difficult.  But I've learned a lot from this series. Thanks, Alex!"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Done
NrBJmtD0kEw,I'm looking to optimize where clause using udt and if I can switch from using (not exists(select 1 from @param) or exists (select 1 from @param where value = mainqueryvalue)). Any suggestions?
NrBJmtD0kEw,Your Tutorials are amazing
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I will have to review and practice this one many times.  I was asked in an interview if I wrote stored procedures.  It was not something I did.  Now I will practice based on what you have shown here.  Also, how do you reference more than one parameter.  Do you add another Where clause, use AND, ?????"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"What the... this went a little faster than I expected. Lost track after you wanted to create the Temp_Employee 😅

Time to rewatch"
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Thank you very much for your excellent tutorial video clips. I regularly watch these clips, and they are incredibly beneficial. I am new to the store procedure. Any help creating an SQL server store procedure connecting two servers would be highly appreciated."
NrBJmtD0kEw,Thank you Alex.
NrBJmtD0kEw,I am definitely rewatching over and over until I fully understand it
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Can someone help me, I keep getting an error. Here is my code:

CREATE PROCEDURE my_procedure
AS
SELECT album_name FROM albums
GO;"
NrBJmtD0kEw,Where to add this. Actualy i didnt understand it.
NrBJmtD0kEw,so you create store procedure by CREATE PROCEDURE name_of_procedure and then AS temp tables and insert the things you want to that temp table can't you do it with regular tables?
NrBJmtD0kEw,you dont explain jack shit.
NrBJmtD0kEw,"right off the bat BIG error. Stored Procedures are not a collection of SQL statements. Its a program written in T-SQL language. And no, thats not a distinction without and difference. Its a REAL difference."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"Cool. This lesson was much more harder than previous one.
I'll check for myself what means ""@"" and other stuff.. Definitely I'll rewatch this video again.

Thank you for this interesting lesson."
NrBJmtD0kEw,"I supplied an argument and when I ran it, it gave an error. When I tried to exec the procedure and I don't add the parameter it works."

Please advise if this is an option, as I would like to have a unified credential that clearly demonstrates my completion of the full Google Data Analytics Certificate."
wnapnTAMj68,I was very on the fence about taking this course. This video and looking at the syllabus really convinced me. Thank you Alex!
wnapnTAMj68,Just a question.. what actual PROFESSIONAL certificate to validate your data analyst knowledge.
wnapnTAMj68,Is it paid? If yes then what is the cost?
wnapnTAMj68,My doubts please clear it ;Can i get the analytics job easily after completing it and will there be any problem in interview If i am from non It background and simply done graduation in other field?

wnapnTAMj68,"I don't know why you all recommend Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This course is AWFUL in terms of structure and tools. A total waste of time. They explain many things over and over again. You can spend one hour on a topic that can be described in 15 min. The instructors don't instruct you, they just read some text from prompter. Practical activities is not what this course is about. I really mean it: this course is disaster. One good blogger like you could teach better than this course."

wnapnTAMj68,"Hello Alex, I found this video about a year after the original upload. I am curious. If you have had a chance to actually go through the course, how did it meet your expectations? I am currently taking the course now to switch careers (from teaching) and sometimes I feel like it is a bit elementary and doesn't give a lot of details. I don't feel confident that I will have the skills for an entry-level data analyst job after finishing this course. What is your updated opinion about the course?"
wnapnTAMj68,"So if I can finish all 8 courses within a month, I will pay $39 only??? And I will get a certificate automatically?"
wnapnTAMj68,how can  we get scholarship
wnapnTAMj68,Thanks you for the overview and recommendations. You the man!👊
wnapnTAMj68,thumbnail is soy face though...
wnapnTAMj68,"I’m confused 
I see you can go to go to google analytic academy and learn it  or I can go to courser

Is there a difference ?"
wnapnTAMj68,"To enrollees & potential enrollees: I stress having a sense of healthy urgency to complete this program. It is not a course, per say. Courses are individual modules adding up to a full specialization, program, or professional certificate; it is a number of courses rolled into a program where one should pace themselves to actually LEARN the materials & not speed rush through it just to obtain a certificate. 

However, you can still review the materials after you've finished if you rushed through it. I don't recommend this method because most ppl don't typically commit themselves 2 do that. And don't cheat. You only short or limit yourself if you don't properly leverage the program's skills & training the right way. 

Employers are generally not hiring based on your tech/hard skills alone (or at all) which can be more or less OTJ training anyway. They are hiring more so based off of your soft skills. Faking it until you're making it usually don't always apply. So build on your business acumen or portfolio after SUCCESSFULLY completing the program & let the program work FOR you not against you.

DON'T DEFEAT THE PURPOSE❕ ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE‼

wnapnTAMj68,I think there are soooo much talking in  the course
wnapnTAMj68,Hey! Not sure if anyone  has experience with this course but a question... Do I just trust the course and go through it A to Z? or would you recommend stopping after the introduction to topics early on to go for a deeper dive into a topic? Ex. After being introduced to SQL I'm not really clear yet. Do I stop and work on it or keep moving forward and the course will come back and really reinforce it? Thanks
wnapnTAMj68,"I absolutely loved this course. I am 2 months in and almost finished. I’ve just started the 8th module today, Complete a Case Study. It’s a bit overwhelming and there’s not much guidance as to how to best utilize the skills I’ve learned so far. I suppose that’s part of the “self-learning” aspect of the program though. I’m very glad I found your channel, I have a feeling It will soon become one of my favorites."
wnapnTAMj68,Wow what a phenomenal video!  Stumbled across this while researching the topic.  Great overview of this certificate.  I do think that google certs are changing the game and they are only going to get better as network effects start to build.
wnapnTAMj68,Can you do a updated video on this 🙏🏽
wnapnTAMj68,I will use this as a beginner cert before I start go to college for this field - cheap tester trial with a cert to boot !
wnapnTAMj68,"Self-paced learning is a great mode for learning. I have been working towards a library technician certification as a precursor towards beginning my MLIS. A friend of mine encouraged me to check out this certificate and its process for data analytics. I was wondering what you thought about his after having completed the Google certificate? I am still looking things over before I make a decision. I think it will be a good decision and direction for me. Great video, Alex. --Little Mountain Lion"
wnapnTAMj68,Just finished the certificate today. Whoooooo!!! that was a tough one.
wnapnTAMj68,"just over half way through.  so far, so good!"
wnapnTAMj68,"Based on real world experience, could someone coming from another financial background take this course and hope to get an analyst job paying a little more than the $69k average?"
wnapnTAMj68,Sooooo sign up for this analytics certificate program ORRRR data analytics bootcamp for 8k? hmmmm

wnapnTAMj68,"Hi Alex, thank you very much for the thorough review. Is it possible to take this specialization with mac M1 or I need a window laptop?"
wnapnTAMj68,Can someone with no prior programming knowledge become a data scientist!!!!
wnapnTAMj68,"Should I learn SQL first, or they will cover it in course itself?"
wnapnTAMj68,The only problem I seem to be having is how to get started with a case study. Could you give me some advice?
wnapnTAMj68,Hey Alex great video! I have some doubts about the payment structure. I'm from India and it's like 3k rs for 6 months . So is it course wise like do I have to pay for each course 3k rs . Or I complete all 8 courses in 6 months . Pls help me with this .
wnapnTAMj68,5:05 to be continued
wnapnTAMj68,should i take another excel curse along with this curse if i dont have any experience or is it enough just with this course?
wnapnTAMj68,"3 courses down 5 to go.... Maybe it's just me but I really feel like they spend way too much time reiterating things, and a lot of the videos provide little or no value.   They also talk very slow and pause a lot. I sped all videos up to at least 1.5 and it made it more bearable."
wnapnTAMj68,"Hi. Seeing that the Google course teaches Tableu, how can the learner access it when it is a subscription-based app?"
wnapnTAMj68,So I guess we study Python after this course..?
wnapnTAMj68,"700,000 have taken it last year. Is that my competition?!"
wnapnTAMj68,"I think Python is a language anyone can teach themselves hence the choice of R is well advised.... With R, possibly Python is walking downhill."
wnapnTAMj68,It’s not worth it. But this is a google platform so why wouldn’t they lie
wnapnTAMj68,"Yeah, plus you can listen to their videos at 2x speed."
wnapnTAMj68,"Hello Captain Alex,

My name is Anand. I am a graduate in Finance with no exposure to Technical knowledge like programming, Python, SQL etc. 

So my question is, Can I still pursue Google/IBM course on Data Analytics as this involves the programming languages. 

If yes, do these courses offer training from basics? Please help🙏"
wnapnTAMj68,How much is the course per month?
wnapnTAMj68,"I have google sheets and google slides, do I buy other programs or will google give them to me to use for the certificate course? And how easy and interesting are these courses?"
wnapnTAMj68,"Hi Alex, thanks for the information! 
Can you please tell, what happen of we are not able to complete all courses in the one month?"
wnapnTAMj68,"Hey guys, would you recommend working on different courses throughout week 1, then week 2 and so on, or better focus on 1 course at a time, finish it as fast as possible and then move on to the next one?

Thank you in advance!"
wnapnTAMj68,I plan to start this course soon. I have a cheap laptop currently do I need to get a good laptop/desktop before I start doing to course? Thanks for the video.
wnapnTAMj68,What's the system requirements. Software requirements. Can this be done on laptop or tablet or mobile as well ?
wnapnTAMj68,I enrolled to it :) I hope I'll become a data analyst.
wnapnTAMj68,"So I've heard that the Google course is great for students within the US but awful for those of us outside the US, I'm on week 3 and I've seen some comments from people outside the US who finished the course and are saying it has been impossible to find a job even after 6 good months of consistent search for worldwide offers, also looking for US jobs, etc, nothing, nothing ever happening... can anyone please share some info on this? I don't want to waste my time studying something that won't give me a job!"
wnapnTAMj68,Where do you write/execute the R or SQL code when practicing exercises or solving the case studies? Does the course comes with an online practice space?
wnapnTAMj68,Hi Alex. Did you complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification? How do you rank it? Thanks!
wnapnTAMj68,Just finished the entire course. It was fantastic but not easy. It was definitely challenging.
wnapnTAMj68,"Hi Alex, greetings from Costa Rica; I really enjoy your videos, keep going! One question. In order to obtain the certificate, is the course #8 (Capstone Project) required? Thanks!!"
wnapnTAMj68,"I am on my 3rd week of course 1, Its going good so far!"
wnapnTAMj68,"Upon completion of this course, do you know any other courses that will take our skill to another level?"
wnapnTAMj68,there are people who spend their lives growing radishes and those that spend their lives cooking crystal meth. both should have the same criminal penalty
wnapnTAMj68,Can anybody let me know that whether I can work on this course on a Mac ?
wnapnTAMj68,Can someone please confirm if this certificate has an expiration date after which it will need to be renewed. No one seems to be talking about that and googling it only shows results for something else “Analytics IQ” from the Academy
wnapnTAMj68,"I took this course and completed it within 4 weeks (Dec-Jan) which is an absolute steal, having to pay for just a month. The course is very beginner friendly and I like that Google put a lot of effort in teaching the non technical aspect of data analytics also which will come in handy in landing a job and on the job as well. Thanks Alex for all you do."
wnapnTAMj68,I have a question regarding this certificate and is that 1053/month is for full 8 courses or for single course? anyone knows anything then please tell me.
wnapnTAMj68,but how much weight does the cert hold? will it actually get a career switcher a job?
wnapnTAMj68,"Google Data Analytics Certificate videos

duMcYRtQITA,Course is now live!! Link Here: http://bit.ly/3cnv9J1
duMcYRtQITA,"I am in process to pass this specialization (By for now I've done 3 of 8 courses);

Also I've improved my knowledge by studing from your videos (about SQL) and try to figure out how to use it in practice...

It's so good to have a resource (like yours) to get several good tips in this way to become a Data Analyst.

Thanks a lot!"
duMcYRtQITA,2:21 So you got 130k+ more subscribers in a niche industry in less than a year?! That is impressive! 👏🏼👏🏼
duMcYRtQITA,"For those complaining about R over Python, just learn SQL and Tableau first. With these 2 plus the Python you already knew, even if you don't know R, that's still a pretty strong resume."
duMcYRtQITA,"I have enrolled for Googledata analytics certificate course.
I also have completed module1,  but I have a doubt do I need enroll in different modules separately???"
duMcYRtQITA,isn't it free now?
duMcYRtQITA,"I finished this course recently. I learned alot but the case study is a mess. The data files are too large to load in R, SQL, or Google Sheets. I keep reaching out to people in the forums about how to work around it, but no one has responded. Seems like the people who completed the case study already had experience in data analytics. Really disappointed in this. What good is it to learn functions and formulas if you can't even load a dataset? Don't get me started on the mess that is Qwkilabs."
duMcYRtQITA,I want to do yours but Prices are too high rs8640/-...😖😖..sir please do something
duMcYRtQITA,Would you recommend this over Microsoft certified Data Analyst associate for improving brand recognition in resume
duMcYRtQITA,currently studying it. In course 3 they try kaggle but they do not explain well about the platform and one is left without understanding it.
duMcYRtQITA,"hi bro im wondering, if i subscribed to coursera plus , is this google certificate course included?"
duMcYRtQITA,Will this certification will be helpful to get placed in any well know companies?
duMcYRtQITA,"This along with covid numbers will combine for a load of go along to get along bullshit that is science fiction epic.

A load of crap for idiots who need to that approval feel complete."
duMcYRtQITA,Wow I just enrolled this course. ❤️
duMcYRtQITA,I don’t think this will help people with no college degree. I think this is super beneficial for people who have a degree and just want to learn the technical skills required for a career change into data analysis/analysis in general.
duMcYRtQITA,"Sir, I'm from India..
If I do this course and complete it, will I be able to apply and get a job in the US..? Or will I be able to apply for jobs in India only.?

Please respond, Thank you"
duMcYRtQITA,would you recommend this course to anyone focusing more on ML and DL?
duMcYRtQITA,You look like more bald James Rolfe
duMcYRtQITA,"The reason for R instead of python is:
Pythons strong suit is not I repeat not data analysis, python is a good substitute for shell scripting."
duMcYRtQITA,You are a liar
duMcYRtQITA,Sir what do u suggest IBM Data Analytics or Google Data Analytics
duMcYRtQITA,Does the Data Analyst or UX Design have more scope?
duMcYRtQITA,im torn between the google cert for data analytics vs ux design. is da at risk of being automated the same way accounting will be? i fugure ux design is safer since it's creativity.
duMcYRtQITA,Currently a Real Estate Studies master student with roughly 1.5 years of studies left to go before trying to land a starting position at a (real estate) consultancy firm. Do you reckon this course would be a good addition? I believe it is as I’ve had a bunch of conversations recently at firms such as Deloitte and CBRE who’ve recommended me to get acquainted with data science prior to graduating.
duMcYRtQITA,Thanks man!
duMcYRtQITA,"Hey Alex, can you do a comparison of this and the IBM data analytics course on Coursera? I think other people may be in the same boat as me as I'm trying to decide between the two options."
duMcYRtQITA,amazing news
duMcYRtQITA,"I have a math education degree but decided I wanted to switch carreers after I graduated. I am currently working my way through data science specialization through John's Hopkins in coursera which uses strictly r. After I complete that, which would be a better route(in your opinion) ; take the Google certificate, start applying for jobs, or take a certificate that uses something other than r to widen my skill range/resume?"
duMcYRtQITA,"So if I complete this certification, and also have a bachelor's degree in stats, and have couple python capstone projects, should I apply to work at Google? Because,  why wouldn't they hire someone if they completed their course..."
duMcYRtQITA,"I have been working as Powercenter ETL developer the last years. I left the Way of Data Analytics some years ago so this course could be useful to refresh my R skills and come back to the Way of Analytics.

Do you think this certificate is a good choice for veterans data analyst who left the Way of Analytics some years ago?"
duMcYRtQITA,"Well, it’s up now!"
duMcYRtQITA,Thanks for sharing this information!
duMcYRtQITA,Could you plz make a compariaon between google certificate and IBM certificate for data analysis and which the best on coursera
duMcYRtQITA,"There are no jobs for this in my state.  I just spent an exhaustive morning and could not find a single job opening in the state of Florida for a data analyst.  I expanded my search and found only three in the U.S. and the minimum requirements is a bachelor's degree, certification and 5 years experience.  That was for a job that pays $39k.  What am I missing?"
duMcYRtQITA,"i just like to point out courses 7 and 8 starts in april (the enrollment button says so). so if you are like me, who is trying to finish the course quickly, it is probably better to wait until the whole courses are online."
duMcYRtQITA,This might be a dumb question but do we need to know R prior to taking this course?
duMcYRtQITA,Hello. Please do you know if google will employ Nigerians that complete this course?
duMcYRtQITA,"I joined Google IT Support course last week, and by the end of the course I'd surely join the data analytics class! Thanks man for the info. ❤️"
duMcYRtQITA,Any info if the certificate will be available to people in the EU?
duMcYRtQITA,"R can be better for statistical analysis (get out your stats books!). Do I prefer R to python, hell no. But will learning it make me a better data scientist, yes. Also if you have what the competition doesn't have, better your chances."
duMcYRtQITA,Is anyone doing online study groups? I'm interested on getting with a groups of individuals to study together.
duMcYRtQITA,please can you estimate how much it will  cost  a person to attempt the course.
duMcYRtQITA,Super excited for this one!
duMcYRtQITA,I'm also sad that they are using R instead of Python...
duMcYRtQITA,I think python would be in an advanced next coming course after this one...
duMcYRtQITA,"Awesome, thank you for consideration. Anyone know when they are going to release the course?"
duMcYRtQITA,"How exciting! 
I cannot imagine using R instead of Python either, but I'm sure there's a method their madness. I look forward to following up and seeing what you've found and if it's worth it to take this course (it's only $40!) Just found your channel and I'll be pushing that subscribe and notification button right now! 
Thank you for quality content and your awesome insights!"
duMcYRtQITA,It is available for india?
duMcYRtQITA,Alex thanks much 🙏❤️
duMcYRtQITA,"Hi Alex, love your videos! Can you do an example of how to do a presentation or creating dashboard?"
duMcYRtQITA,"Just a suggestion, instead of having two folders in bookmarks, there is also an option to have separate chrome profiles."
duMcYRtQITA,I have a question. I've been studying SQL on my own and I feel like I'm doing great BUT at times I feel so overwhelmed at the amount that I feel I need to memorize in order to be considered for a data analyst position. Is this true? Or do you just need the basics and learn as you go?
duMcYRtQITA,So funny to see fights between R and Python people)  learn more languages and grow as a person)
duMcYRtQITA,"Hey Alex, sorry to keep asking, but when do you plan on doing the data analyst project tutorials for entry levels? Also, would you ever consider releasing  your own course on udemy? Based on exactly the things you use on your day to day role as well as exactly the things you learnt that helped you finally land your first role in data analysis?"
duMcYRtQITA,"Hello everyone! Can anyone confirm me that the course is only open to US and Canada residents?
I've been waiting for this course, but I'm from Europe : ("
duMcYRtQITA,R and Python (as well as a collection of *nix utilities for that matter) are equally useful to know in the context of data analytics.
duMcYRtQITA,New subscriber here! Looking forward to this Google Cert. Switching careers after Covid hit.
duMcYRtQITA,What a coincidence! I was just searching for an R programming course about analytics. I guess now I just have to wait.  haha
duMcYRtQITA,March 17th is the date
duMcYRtQITA,Do you think we will get opportunities in India through this course?
duMcYRtQITA,thank you i have a question can a data analyset  take a job online like from another contry and get payed for it when he finish the job  ??? thank for your time
duMcYRtQITA,Shit I'm in this stupid one from simplilearn that's so stupid way too fast paced for me.
duMcYRtQITA,Would you say that this certificate is for people trying to get into analytics and not so much for people already working in the field and/or those with a related degree? If im already doing basically everything laid out in the curriculum on a daily basis and have a secure job in the field what types of value add could this or other comparable data analytics courses/certs bring for me? Seems like a lot out of content is for people trying to enter the field and not for those a couple years in
duMcYRtQITA,Hey Alex can you do a video that talk about Business Intelligence BI and what's different between data analyst and BI analyst? Thanks
duMcYRtQITA,"Hello Alex , do you have Instagram or something that i can contact you for some career advice about data analysis (it wont take a lot of time of course)?"
duMcYRtQITA,Will This course help in getting a job for a person who is not from the USA or Canada?
duMcYRtQITA,"Is there any way to request google to include Python instead of R, because 90% learners want using python which is in demand.. 
Thanks!!"
duMcYRtQITA,Another great video !! Thanks Alex for the inputs !
duMcYRtQITA,"Google have another course for process automation that teaches python. I'm in grad school for business analytics and insights. It really makes me questions if I want to continue my studies and jump to Google. I think the Google brand is a lot more recognizable than most schools.  If the training I receive is good enough to work for Google, I should be getting a job elsewhere is the thinking."
duMcYRtQITA,Google courses are so far not very good made
duMcYRtQITA,"So even if people who live outside the US or Canada can use a VPN to access it, we won't get the career services."
duMcYRtQITA,Why Tableau and not Power BI? 😔
duMcYRtQITA,"Is this for only US and Canadian citizen? I am trying to register, it give option only US and Canada. I am from Bangladesh and how can I take this course?"
duMcYRtQITA,Anyone know i COGNITIVE CLASS CERTIFICATION are legit or a fake copy of Ibm certification???
duMcYRtQITA,17th March
duMcYRtQITA,R is used for Data analysis in this certificate but but I was hoping  Python
duMcYRtQITA,I'm a python developer and would like to learn more of it. But it is very disappointing to know they are using R in this. Do you advise me to aim for this certificate?
duMcYRtQITA,"Thanks for the update, been waiting for this since covid started, what a tease!"
duMcYRtQITA,Thank you for your sacrifice struggling through R instead of Python. We will build monuments in the future of your sacrifice.
duMcYRtQITA,Where's excel and Power BI ? And who needs R today ? You don't even need python itself. Most of the work can be done with Python autoML libraries.
duMcYRtQITA,Sar ..Zip code is not added
duMcYRtQITA,Sir ... The language of Data analystics is not in English but in Hindi
duMcYRtQITA,"Yesterday I finally decided to take the IBM Data Analyst course and this came out, now I don't know what to do :("
duMcYRtQITA,"I know they mentioned no previous experience is required, but still I am going to ask this question, do i need to have knowledge or exp in  R ? or will they teach from basics ?"
duMcYRtQITA,"@Alex The Analyst, do you think it is a good idea in getting both the IBM Data Analysis Certificate and Google Data Analytics certificate in order to improve the chances of landing an entry level job?"
duMcYRtQITA,I’ve had the email updates on for about 6 months now. Now the hype is real!
duMcYRtQITA,"Hello Alex,

Please can you try n get some discounts for your subscribers."
duMcYRtQITA,"Thank you, I really want to take this and really hope it is enough to help begin a career change."
duMcYRtQITA,excited for this one. but R :(
duMcYRtQITA,"So what are we learning; SQL, Tableau and R?
Will Excel be a part of it?"
duMcYRtQITA,The course is currently only for the US and Canadian citizens right???
duMcYRtQITA,Am ready to put more efforts and more time but is this course available for India?
duMcYRtQITA,Can't wait to submit my financial aid application.
duMcYRtQITA,is this course entirely free or i just have to pay for certificate?
duMcYRtQITA,Cool I didn’t know about this
duMcYRtQITA,"Awesome.. I guess u previously made a prediction on this and it's here..

Alex the Analyst for a reason ..🙌🙌

And i know the course is going to be of great quality... because it's been from Google...

And"
duMcYRtQITA,I think it's important to know that we don't have to learn everything from one source. I am doing a BI course and the lectures on Tableau were pretty quick and not easy to grasp. I had to look up another source for tutorials on Tableau and now I understand it better and I can continue with the initial course.
duMcYRtQITA,"What about in Coursera, IBM Data Analysis course & I completed it. I it helpful?"
duMcYRtQITA,"Thank you for the great content, looking forward to the future videos on the course."
duMcYRtQITA,I wonder if I should do this or the one on Udemy that uses Python and touches on ML. Thoughts? Open to anyone to respond
QG1fo7LFesA,Fresher resume
QG1fo7LFesA,You should make one of these videos for this year!
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hi Alex this content is great, at first glance I can't see any mistake on this resume but the way you explain things it became clearer and somehow guide me on revising my own resume."
QG1fo7LFesA,"Alex, wow, I have been working with professional recruiters for a long time and your advice is spot-on! Keep up the good work, thanks!"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Be a little mean/direct Alex, you need to help the people fix their mistakes 

You can't do that unless you tell them that they made mistakes"
QG1fo7LFesA,What's goin' on everybody?!
QG1fo7LFesA,"Regarding the broad scope at 19:00 ; I have similar desires to what is being described here. YES, data science is a HUGE field, but I am not yet certain on what path I want to take, and I don't think I will be certain for a long time. I want to work anywhere in the field and find my place, so I am starting with analytics, but I would accept entry level for any field within data sciences. Entry data engineer? Sign me up. Entry data analyst? Yes please. Entry data scientist? Well you probably won't hire me, but I'd love that too!"
QG1fo7LFesA,amazing content! can you do a resume review for freshers specifically?
QG1fo7LFesA,Shout out to the applicant who graduated from Simon Fraser University and British Columbia Institute of Technology !!  My alma maters !!
QG1fo7LFesA,“Who use Hotmail!?” Omg that was classic
QG1fo7LFesA,You made me laugh when you reviewed the resume  with hotmail because I deleted mine 18 years ago. Excellent work keep up the hard work. Thank you
QG1fo7LFesA,Any special things to consider for someone who has experience in some other tech field but is trying to switch to Analytics?
QG1fo7LFesA,"I am glad you talked about how age is assumed from a resume.  I only use the last 8-10 years of work, get certs every few years and only mention the degree - not the year. What are your feelings on “hiding” your age in the resume?"
QG1fo7LFesA,"The second resume review had me rolling 😂😂😂 
""hOtmail...okay let me get this up...who uses HOTMAIL??"" 
and then ""And the ""seas of data"" thing...*smirks*"" oh lord 😂"
QG1fo7LFesA,"The address part leave out. Just say city and state, telephone, email, LinkedIn, github.   Include name and position you want.  The summary or objective part i don't  know. Top section of resume."
QG1fo7LFesA,Hey are you still reveiwing resume
QG1fo7LFesA,"Yikes, I review resumes pretty frequently and all of these would end up dripping in red ink. 😱"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Thank you for the terrific video, Alex! I'm implementing your suggestions on my resume! 
Also, a quick question - I see resumes with tools such as 'Cognos' & 'SSIS' these days. The web says that these are 'ETL' tools - What is your opinion on ETL, is it paramount for an aspiring Data Analyst to learn ETL? Please shed some light on it. 
Thanks again! Cheers!"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Alex, what you think about cover letter? Should we use it? Thank you for your tips!!!"
QG1fo7LFesA,Will this series be continued? I would like to send you my resume for review :)
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hi Alex,
How to create portfolios for the Data Analyst role?
And your live session with codebasics was really good and helpful.
Thank you!"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hello Alex, I've been watching some of your videos to get an idea if Data Analyst is something I'd like to get into. I'm a Math teacher of 13 years looking to change careers. I have a BS in Math with 24 hours in CIS. I feel that Data Analyst might make a good fit. I was wondering how I could translate teaching into Data Analyst, especially for making a resume. I've watched your video on courses to take, and I'm planning on starting those in the upcoming weeks."
QG1fo7LFesA,Taking notes
QG1fo7LFesA,Such a great content as usual . Can you make a video for working as a remotely data analysts specially for people who aren't from the US and targeting the US & European companies to work in? the likelihood of being accepted and the requirements ? that would be such amazing and supportive
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hi Alex can you critique my resume? I work as a junior data scientist with 3+ years of Python experience, 4+ years of R, 3+ sql, and 2+ years of aws. I am applied math / statistics graduate. I have 2 years of experience with machine learning, but it seems that my resume might have too much going on. I will see how I can get in touch with you and what tips you might have for me. 

Thank you"
QG1fo7LFesA,Can you give suggestions on my resume ? I am in my last year of college and looking for job opportunities soon
QG1fo7LFesA,I like this segment. I found it useful. Please continue to do this kind of thing in the future.
QG1fo7LFesA,I like that potted flower in the background. Its called a Mother in Law's tongue or Snake plant. It purifies air in the room and emits lots of oxygen.
QG1fo7LFesA,"First time watching real resume review videos and critique, love this category!"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Great video! Very clear headed advice. I'm reworking my resume to try and land some summer internships so this video is a great tool for quick tips. 

I appreciate how thorough your channel is for some of these things that aren't always covered in classes at university - professional development stuff that I find invaluable."
QG1fo7LFesA,"@Alex The Analyst Would you still say the Microsft SQL Server course you reccomended is still the best sql course for a begineer,as i see it is a few years old now. Thank you!"
QG1fo7LFesA,A few thoughts while watching this one when is it okay for me to start adding python to my resume? I just started learning a few months ago and I'm not very confident in it so I haven't added it. Also it would be fun to have the person there so you could ask them questions while you're reviewing the resume.
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hello Alex , please will you do my resume review??"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hi , great job"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Thanks for this Alex, honesty is what I like when someone is critiquing me or my work.  It might be harsh but it's also constructive criticism and it helps see what you can improve on.  Resumes are no different so really appreciate you doing this.  Hopefully you can do mine on your next resume review video."
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hey Alex, do you think that the sales experience in the resume would come in handy for a Data Analyst since presenting and selling the report/data is a big part of the job? Or is that something only for after you've got the job?"
QG1fo7LFesA,"wasn't bothered with these videos when you first mentioned, thought they would be too dissimilar to me. Found the experience in many of these similar to myself, glad i gave it the chance - shouldn't have doubted you Alex. Keep up the good work! Many great comments below"
QG1fo7LFesA,Just started my university IT courses focusing on data analytics :D You have been an inspiration and I appreciate the part you have played in helping guide my career path.
QG1fo7LFesA,You’re cool for this one ☝️.
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hey Alex, I like thumbnail its suites for video, keep doing vids."
QG1fo7LFesA,Thank You. This was very useful.
QG1fo7LFesA,Can you make a video on how to go from a youth worker to DA
QG1fo7LFesA,"Thanks for reviewing resumes, Alex. Always interesting to hear other opinions.

I personally appreciate the honesty. Reviews of anything are useless if they're not truthful! Not pointing out areas for improvement or sharing real impressions would be like not letting a friend know they've got lettuce stuck in their teeth. 😂"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Great content, as per. Just handed in my CV for an internal modelling analyst position, here goes nothing! Great tips learnt from you, the SQL videos you have done were a great catch up for me!"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hi Alex , as a graduate from Bachelor of Commerce , can I become a Data analyst?"
QG1fo7LFesA,"Hi Alex,
I am basically a python automation developer. I learned tableau, do I need to get certified in tableau?"
QG1fo7LFesA,keep it simple !!!
QG1fo7LFesA,"Oh man, I missed it again. I really wanted you to review mine. I have been trying to switch to a DA career. Have been applying to companies since past 1.5 month but not getting much response."
pYRG5X7110M,"Hey Alex, I’m new here, and I’ve seen many posts suggesting I check out your page to learn how you got into Data Analytics. I currently work in accounting in healthcare but am looking to transition into Data Analytics. Could you point me to that video? Thanks for all that you do!"
pYRG5X7110M,I know this is an old video but should you learn regular statistics before statistics for data science?
pYRG5X7110M,"Alex I am Happy I found you. I subscribed to your channel, and guaranteed I am going to follow your videos and thanks for bringing all these topics esp for DAs in one place"
pYRG5X7110M,Will this course be good for managers leading a group of data analysts. I need to quickly get up to speed and have some form of a refresher since the last time i deal with statistics was 10 years ago. Thanks.
pYRG5X7110M,"Hey Alex, do you have any recommended book for statistics?"
pYRG5X7110M,Please where's the link for the Udemy?
pYRG5X7110M,"Great video - but have to admit after watching it that I'm not really buying into the idea that ""anyone"" can learn this.  That formula you shared looked super intense and I've never done anything nearly that complex.   Is basic high-school algebra enough to get someone going in this or should there be something before this?"
pYRG5X7110M,"hi alex, I want to know if this course is enough for working as a data analysis? Do I need to learn more ? If I do, what kind of areas I need to go through? Great video! thanks a  lot🥰"
pYRG5X7110M,Is the code still valid anyone who has signed up recently? Should I take this course as a prep course for Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) if I don't have a Stat background?
pYRG5X7110M,"Hey Alex I am already doing 'The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla', is it okay if I am a beginner?"
pYRG5X7110M,"To my surprise! I've been taking this course in 365datascience since July. Really a great course, nice to see your recommandation as well, thanks!"
pYRG5X7110M,Thanks Alex .
pYRG5X7110M,You recommend any course for medical statistics. I am a doctor and i want to use statistics for research purposes
pYRG5X7110M,"Hi Alex,Can you share a new code ?"
pYRG5X7110M,"Thank you for sharing this. Although i personally like udemy as a general idea, everything i found to be usefull on udemy had a completely free course on youtube too. Either for Python, C#, Java, Javascript, Data Analysis, Excel and such. So from my personal point of view udemy really needs youtuber to promote them, because it's youtuber who are the biggest threat to their business modell. You can actually find whole university lectures on youtube for free and if that's not helpfull i don't know what is. Also in combination with a couple of more practical videos like the ones you are providing i can't find real use in paying udemy for something that i can have 1:1 for free on youtube and often from people who know better than the guys on udemy."
pYRG5X7110M,"If anyone has done this course, I’d like to know how it is before I spend the money. Does it really break things down into easy pieces?"
pYRG5X7110M,"Wow! I have gotten a mentor for my data analytics career. 
Thanks so much Sir for being there for beginners,this video is really informative ."
pYRG5X7110M,Will this course provide me all the knowledge i need to know about statistics in data analytics field?
pYRG5X7110M,"best course for power BI???since I know stats ,python but starting to learn BI tools nd  planned to take power bi.pleaser recommend"
pYRG5X7110M,"been with this course, it good for begineers"
pYRG5X7110M,"Hello Alex, Thank you so much for the helpful content. It's been helping quite a lot for me. Nonetheless, I just tried a couple of times the COUPON you've put in the video description, but that didn't work for me all... Could you please confirm if it's still valid?"
pYRG5X7110M,but Udemy is kind of expensive compared to cousera.
pYRG5X7110M,"if anybody knows the coupon, please do share"
pYRG5X7110M,"Thank you for the course recommendation, I was thinking to take this course, but didn't know if it will be worth it. Great content"
pYRG5X7110M,that coupon code didnt work lol
pYRG5X7110M,I really hate math where i had to taken it 3 times in community college thats how bad I am
pYRG5X7110M,"Hi Alex, what is the link to the page that has all the Udemy courses that you recommend to take?"
pYRG5X7110M,"Hello Alex!
Thank you for your awesome videos as always.

This was me some years back...we were practically doing all the data cleaning/prep/EDA and simply called it QA. I had no idea until very recently that this is one of the most crucial stages in the DA /DS process!
The only thing back then was that I would ask over and over again what all the data we captured through all those expensive sensors would be used for and EVERYONE said they had no idea, only that they knew it would be in a database, end of story!
Now that I know about data science and its sub-fields, it's all making sense to me now."
pYRG5X7110M,the coupon doesn't work :(
pYRG5X7110M,"Hello Alex, I have a diploma in business Administration. Do you think I can qualify for a Bachelor’s degree in statistics or are there short courses that can lead me to that? If yes... what are the requirements for the short courses and how long are they?"
pYRG5X7110M,"Not sure if you’ve addressed this before in another video but what if you’re like terrible at math, like barely got through secondary school taking math?"
pYRG5X7110M,"So, statistic for data analyst and data science are the same thing?"
pYRG5X7110M,Can you pls start a series on Salesforce admin course
pYRG5X7110M,"Is there a minimum age to take this course, what do you recommend? Thanks for the informative video :)"
pYRG5X7110M,Thanks for the knowledge. Everyone plz spread this channel.
pYRG5X7110M,As a statistic student.which programming language is best R or Python?
pYRG5X7110M,Thank you so much for uploading this it came on time
pYRG5X7110M,"Hey Alex!
As usual, I followed your advice and enrolled in this course.
Nothing but great content. Although I had to deal with statistics during my studies, this course is really helpful to brush up important topics and is explained really good.
I do Really appreciate your videos, thanks a lot!"
pYRG5X7110M,"awesome topic alex! been googling ""best sources for statistics"" for awhile and happy to see you made a vid on the topic. much appreciated!"
pYRG5X7110M,Hi Alex! This was great info. I know you dislike bootcamps but I joined one lol I was overwhelmed with trying to get the info I needed streamlined. I’m actually about to start learning statistics in the program but I want to learn a bit before I start. Thanks
pYRG5X7110M,"Finally, a channel that addresses data analytics in details! Thank you for starting this channel! Or put it the other way - I am happy that I found your channel!"
pYRG5X7110M,"Hey Alex, I often watch your videos because they help me a lot, but I think analytical thinking is also important, could you talk about how to improve analytical thinking? Thank you so much!"
pYRG5X7110M,Nice video again! Just a random question are doing “side projects” as important for getting a data analyst job compared to something like a software developer
pYRG5X7110M,Digging your channel. All your info is really straightforward.  Can you put a video together covering hardware requirements and preferences?
pYRG5X7110M,Alex you seem to have studied hundreds of courses for your DA role mehnnnn. How did you study all those? Did you make notes or did you just to memorize as much as possible?
pYRG5X7110M,"Hi Alex,

How are you?? I remembered asking you this question last year. And you didn't have any proper recommendations then.
But I undertook this  Udemy course. It is really very fantastic. I must say this is the best course.

Also, I want you to have a look at Mavel Analytics online course, which is a complete package of Excel, Tableau, SQL and PowerBI.
Right now, I am undertaking this course and enjoying it a lot.

Thanks,
Veena"
pYRG5X7110M,The coupon is not working 😢
pYRG5X7110M,"Thanks for making a video on this topic! Im currently majoring in statistics, so good to know that this course you recommended is inline with the stuff I've been learning!"
pYRG5X7110M,For someone who’s is interested in BI/BA how much stats would you say to learn ?
pYRG5X7110M,"hi alex, what is the best way to study using the course? i struggle memorizing formulas for a long time and was wondering if you took notes or just listened to the instructor."
pYRG5X7110M,"I failed AP Statistics in High School, thought I would never use it again lol now I'm learning p value and realized the answer closer to 0 is the greater value haha, Ex. (P value) 0.65 < (alpha) 0.05"
pYRG5X7110M,this video is really informative!
pYRG5X7110M,I just completed this course along with SQL ( again one of your recommended one ). I do have experience working on advanced excel. what should be my next course of action to be able to apply for a experienced data analyst role....like what projects and from where.... Please guide
pYRG5X7110M,I get so many questions on this. Thanks Alex! This isn't an easy find and there's no automatic answer like Andrew Ng ML course. Very helpful.
pYRG5X7110M,Hey Alex love all your videos can you make one on deep learning
pYRG5X7110M,Thank for uploading... just thinking to ask you about this and here we go 🤗🤗
NViKsiGP4TY,"So the SQL course was good up until a point. I did notice after watching your videos that Dataquest did teach some not-so-great habits (i.e: using a.ColumnName, b.ColumnName for joins). Also, if you do their excel courses, it is possible for other learners to access your work (even though they said it shouldn't be happening). I did have someone constantly coming in and deleting my data, which was frustrating for projects."
NViKsiGP4TY,"Might help to get a new version of this video. Data quest has added tableau and power bi, along with other career paths now."
NViKsiGP4TY,"However, Datacamp has some advantages, some of which are price and website layout which makes it preferable."
NViKsiGP4TY,I did python basics before I hit the paywall in both dataquest and datacamp and I really prefer dataquest. In datacamp they skip many details as if you're supposded to know them but in dataquest they are all covered.
NViKsiGP4TY,"My Dataquest experience has been horrible. Their payment system is full of bugs. I got charged wrongly and there is basically no customer support in Dataquest, not even a telephone number you can call. Plus they retained my credit card information without my consent after more than a year and I got a surprise bill. My tip is: stay away from this platform if you don't want headaches."
NViKsiGP4TY,Is dataquests lifetime access for around $700 usd worth it or yearly subscription should do the trick? Please advise. Thanks.
NViKsiGP4TY,"you lost me at ""if you like reading""... no, i hate reading. rather get a video as I'm a visual learner. lol!"
NViKsiGP4TY,Yes they use Jupyter notebooks in guided projects
NViKsiGP4TY,"@10:12 Anyone who had paid for the course, can you answer this question from Alex?"
NViKsiGP4TY,Could you do one for codecademy~~~ Thanks!!!🙏
NViKsiGP4TY,"Use the below link for a 15$ discount on a Dataquest subscription
app.dataquest.io/referral-signup/qf46nghx/"
NViKsiGP4TY,"I've used dataquest and Datacamp. I prefer dataquest because of two things.
The first is personal, I'm a reading person. I'm not able to learn following videos. 
But there is a different thing. Dataquest's career path are more cohesive. 
Datacamp has multiple skill paths and they just combine them in some bigger career path. This create the following problem: In many moments, videos do not build in previous videos. 
So, you may learn how to do something with a specific package, and then in the next set of videos, a different package is used or the re-explain a package already covered in other course.

In dataquest, as they have fewer paths, it seems that they are always buillding on top of previous courses. This is great for solidifying your knowledge."
NViKsiGP4TY,"Usually, his videos have credibility. However, in this case, the video is too long and with too much guessing because he doesn’t have enough access to actually see the content. Consequently, he’s reviewing what he thinks is in the product."
NViKsiGP4TY,I think you should have subscribed for at least 1 month or trial a little deeper before making video.
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hey Alex, I remember you recommended an SQL book to check out on one of your previous videos. Can you tell me the name please? 🙏🏾"
NViKsiGP4TY,"Here’s a thing. We are working on certain project and sending the newest versions of pbix file to each other. But, despite the desktop version of power bi, it’s hard to build a pathway of data source each time we need to open file and work with it. Have you faced such problems? Do you have any advices?  

Thanks in advance 🙌🏻"
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hey Alex! Iam doing a comp sci degree in my first year,and been watching a lot of your videos (very interested in data analytics) What side projects/skills would you recommend for me to take part in? To Almost guarantee a data analytics internship / placement in my second year. thank you."
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hi Alex, hope you and your family is doing well now,
there are a lot of universities now days providing MS degree, diploma, certificate programs on data analytics like George Mason University could you review those curriculum as well if possible and if one should go for an one year degree program? TIA"
NViKsiGP4TY,"Can you make a video if you were to restart learning data analytics again where you would start? A very beginners guide, there’s so many resources but I’m not sure where to start. Thanks Alex love the content keep up the good work."
NViKsiGP4TY,"Thanks for the review Alex. Would you make a video about ""Business intelligence Analyst"" anytime possible? I hear about it frequently these days. How different is it from ""data analyst"""
NViKsiGP4TY,"Dataquest, coursera, or data camp for data analyst?"
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hey, Alex.
I hope you and your family have stay safe in the storm."
NViKsiGP4TY,"I think you should pay for the premium version to do full review, this review is not comprehensive enough"
NViKsiGP4TY,"What's wrong with the good old MOOCs? 
Coursera for instance has good data science specializations taught by world-class experts from known Universities."
NViKsiGP4TY,"Hm, the website does't seem to be worth the money."
NViKsiGP4TY,how are you doing after the storm? hope that you and your family are doing great.
NViKsiGP4TY,Hey Alex! Still waiting for your best laptop for data analyst video
NViKsiGP4TY,Another great review. M gonna try it for the projects
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Wait wait wait... 06:32 That's just over-complicated on the R side. You don't need any packages to do this. The read.csv function will already check if a variable is numeric. So just run
nba <- read.csv(...)
mean(nba)
purrr and dplyr is just needed for the syntax you are used to. The base R can do all you asked in 2 lines. Even if the file you're reading is a multi column csv you just call 
summary(nba) and you get it"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"As non-tech,I learned R first June 2025, because of seminar. They discussed mapping in QGIS and I  enjoyed the whole time. R is user-friendly, open source.Simple to use.

I wanted to learn coding as I cant use QGIS without R coding.

Learned R using app, now I create my own code for simple computations I need for work (Excel & arithmetic). 

Yes, R has different way to write  function/expression/commands you want vs python. They have similarities as well.

I plan to learn python within this month, July. Just finishing some of my notes from learning R.

Discovered R compiler online 😂 and using codes I created, I no longer will use calculator. Just use R compiler. 

Also, use R to excel. No need to  create cells in Excel anymore! 

just write codes, test it on compiler, then run it on actual R studio, then placed on excel at my documents in computer. Creating Excel sheet in faster time!

R is time saver for me 😂
My life is easier now with R."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,sounds like R is your exgirlfriend
1gdKC5O0Pwc,can i use R for stats and visualization and then python for modeling and deep learning on that same analysed data done in r?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Bro 6:01 to get the mean in r syntax is one line of code. Mean(Df$column) and that’s it lol
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I'm not interested in being a data scientist. But for some light business intelligence/business process management.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I think any statement about ""what language is better/best"" should be qualified with a ""for"" statement.  R is better for specialized statistical models. Python is better for deep learning and ease of use. SQL is better for database management and simple questions. C++ is better for high performance applications.  No language is better at everything."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Clearly this guy has very little knowledge, perhaps even no working knowledge about R. LOL"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lcwTGA7MZw
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"R is easier to learn than python. I already know python, and it was hard to learn. I am learning R in the present and I must say its easier."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R can be embedded into web apps. Look up R Shiny
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Minitab >>> Python
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R is the worst
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Thank you Alex!
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I think it depends on ours strenghts in whatever the lenguage is, R is a multi-good to know functions program, if not, it could be difficult, so the same with Py in another order: Having Expp with R in Stats I could say that both have advantajes, and I would use one or another in diff purpruses depending how I started learning with them, the important thing here is know their global utilities"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I mostly do data analysis on survey data and in my experience R is more robust in this regard. For instance, there are several packages that will create survey weights for you, but I have yet to find one Python package that actuially works.

I do agree that Python syntax is somewhat easier to pick up, but once you understand vectorized operations in R it becomes easier to use."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,What is your LinkedIn?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I use R, but want to learn python eventually! Thx for this video"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"As other pointed out, you are very biased towards Python in this video and even lied on certain aspects, like writing a very unecessary long code in R compared to a short one in Pyhon. So you either don't know R, or you lied to prove your point."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Python is unmatched.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"is it compulsory to learn both? if i want to be a data scientist, do I need to use R?"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Excellent summary, great balance of conciseness and examples.

""R is harder to learn, but has more features""... specifically for analytics, right? My understanding is Python has far more features in general. Never heard of someone building a mobile app in R."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"IBM has a bit more nuanced view on when to use what:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lcwTGA7MZw"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I thought R had many issues. Then I tried Python and I found it has the same issues, but worse."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Python is a general programming language. R is a statistical programming language. Obviously Python cannot compete with R when it comes to statistics and R cannot compete with Python when it comes to programming in general
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"You said Python is better than R, then said its just my opinion. You should have clarified that in the post that its just my opinion. 

But you wrote a single statement that- ""Python is better than R"". Any person reading that would think that you are stating this as a fact. This is why it was controversial. 

Adding the words- ""its just my opinion"" or ""its more suitable for my job"" would have taken the controversy out of it. Perhaps you just wanted to stir up unnecessary controversy for attention."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"R start vector indexing from 1, not 0. It really did a great job of making programmers ANGRY"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Alex, your level of R is beginner, with all due respect. There is a noticeable bias in his speech. 

In general, because Python is more related to C and programming languages in general, it is easier for programmers. R is easier for people with no prior programming knowledge; they learn to program as long as they learn to use R. They can use R on a day-to-day basis without delving into functional programming, object-oriented programming, and so on.

The scalability issue is real. IT teams like Python best for launching products because it's their comfort zone. However, it's easier to build a dashboard or application in R. Give it a try!

I agree with the argument that there is no best, but it is necessary to reduce the bias of our point of view to make a comparison."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Simple fact is that a good programmer in either language can handle 95% of data analytics tasks easily.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Sorry but I disagree with most of what you said. First off all R is the best for bioinformatics. Python is limited. For example There are no (besides a poor copy of diseq2) packages to deal with differential gene expression. In R you have tens of them. Speed?? Unfortunately you know nothing about R targets, qs, fastr, etc. most of high performance libraries in R are compiled with C, C++ or Fortran!!! How can you beat this with slow python. Parallelisation is supported by default olin R targets and very easy to implement using future and other packages. Plotting??? Are you serious? There is nothing better than R!  I think that your comparison is unbiased and unfair. You just don’t have enough experience with R. RMarkdown? Quarto + R targets and you can do EVERYTHING in bioinformatics. Python is just the best as a general purpose language. R is sophisticated. That is it. P.S. R shiny??  Did you missed it???"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"It's insane how many times you had to ask ahead for forgiveness to avoid potentially offending anyone. We are all different and haver different opinions - get over it people! Very cool video mate. As a statistician I'm very in love with R, but I'm trying to learn Python as I am very aware of it's coverage and power. Cheers"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Why do you compare apples with oranges ? Both ar e fruits..  Python is much much better... BUT for data analysis is R..
If you work as data analyst there is no second thought but else do not loose time with nonsense... Learn javascript and python..."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R have its own features. Both language have some speacialities.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Pipes. Enough said.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R code can be difinitely maintained by markdown for example.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Which one would you learn first?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,It would be nice to have a video with examples or real world scenarios for both cases.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I am trying to find the best way to build a sports betting model using past statistics to project the outcome of future games/events/etc. I have messed around a little bit on Microsoft Excel doing this but I was just curious if anyone has a suggestion for which program would be the best for my needs between Excel/Python/R. Thank you for the help!
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R has a lot of CERN libraries that are very helpful.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I learned R and Python and I can say R is much easier to learn but Python is way more robust.  I replaced a VBA code that creates MS Excel workbooks from a template, and it took like 3 seconds to complete.  Using R took like 45 seconds.. After I saw the benefits and speed of Python,  I put R aside and focus on Python."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Both are needed once things get a little advanced
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I usually do my data manipulation on python then push the final data to R for statistics. Idk R is just easier and cleaner when it comes to statistical models but tough to manipulate data with, while in Python it is super easy to manipulate data with but put a gun to my head I still refuse to use it for statistical models bc god damn it is confusing to me lol"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"When I get to know Python, I immediately throw away everything I know about R from my brain into rubbish bin.                      LOVE PYTHON!!!!"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I'm also a Python fan for life!
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Python's data structure is more suitable for data science too. Python's data structure Dictionary is just another name of json data set. R's list can do similar job, however, simply not the same form as json."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Python is a compuer scientist designed language, R is a statistician designed one. Python uses = for assignment, while R use -> as assignment symbol. Python's function is more flexible than R. Deep learning packages is written for Python, but not R. So R is a statistics-lise language, and Python is a data science language."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6bkSINd0W0
check out my ctypes execution time comparison"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,thank you!🙏
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"One word R sucks!
It’s apis are completely bullshit.
It’s syntax stinks.
Just learn about its class you’ll know how shitty it is.
Thank God I just completed the paper and I never look back."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Pandas is dope .
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I dont unterstand the last point: R is for statistics and Python for machine learning. I thought, machine learning is nothing else than statistic?"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,This guy is not using R correctly if that's how he's calculating the mean for a dataset lol
1gdKC5O0Pwc,The genesis of R actually dates back to circa 1975 at Bell Labs where is was named S. Python had its origin around 1989.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Loved it! Thank you very much for your content, just started following you. 

My advice is just express your opinion like you did, makes content far more unique. 

Cheers!"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Hi so professional and we'll justified congrats great learning experience I had Tku 💐
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"What is machine learning, did machine learn something?"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Thank you!

I'll try both.
Approximately in a month I'll have a course in Coursera about R (from Google Data Analyst Certification), 
but after that I'm interested to try  Python as well."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Love this video.  I'm still going after 'R' for statistical reasons, but I am just now getting into the field.  HOWEVER, I felt like this was excellently put together, and anyone in the IT universe needs to understand that they might have to look at a NUMBER of potential tools.  SQL, APACHE, anything cloud, etc, etc.  In other words....*sigh*. todays IT-dude, needs to understand that the field of informatics is CONSTANTLY changing.  

I remember some years ago I was talking to a COBOL programmer, and he was whining about how he lost his job because of (I dunno, I think it was C, or C++, or something) in anywise all I could think was, well, why don't you just learn the new stuff?  It didn't make him happy.  Either way, I'm going to pursue R and Python, just so I have a bunch of tools in my toolbox.  Bottom line is, programming is programming, and I don't find a ton of difference between Java from 18-years ago, in the area of semantics.  Boolean, loops, arrays, etc, etc, etc."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"what I find nice about R ist the combination with RStudio and the support for Markdown and embed the R code. And then you get out PDF or web page. And you can also work with Latex. So maybe you can not embed R in a typical web page, but otoh you can build web site and PDF nicely with RStudio without the need of additional software-"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"The R code for your example is:

x <- read.csv('nba_2013.csv')
colMeans(x)

or (if x is not all numeric):
x <- read.csv('nba_2013.csv')
sapply(x, mean)

That's it.

All you're doing is demonstrating that you don't know how to program in R."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Two minutes in, you're pedalling the standard nonsense that R is a statistical package. I've been using R for twelve years and pretty much never for statistics. Text processing, data cleaning, report writing (markdown) and GIS, GIS, GIS. R is really good for mapping and geospatial data processing (not just spatial statistics)."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,I'm a person who is confused to choose the programming language as a beginner..can anyone tell me  what you will choose R or python?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R works better in two scenarios.. if u have a non programming background or if data is ready.. in other cases python is better.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,HI
1gdKC5O0Pwc,please tell the things very fast and small. I don't link this long video. Please complete in 2 minutes. Here you have started the main topic at 2 minutes. You are wasting lot of our time.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Your comments are vey biased towards python. Anyone claiming you can’t easily maintain scalable code for big data applications in R simply hasn’t taken the time to educate themselves in the tool.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Stopped watching at 5:55 because either Alex was biased or he has no idea whatsoever about R, since he did not use the mean( ) function which is even a base R function and you don't need to install and load any package to use it."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"filtering with pandas 

df[df['column'] == x] 

vs R data.table 

df[column == x, ]

What is easier to read? Become even worse in pandas then you have more complex condition.

Not to mention multi index in pandas. It is a hell.

And direct comparison with reading of csv in r that you can also do in 2 lines:

x <- fread('somefile.csv')
summary(x)

You can do thing very unreadable in both languages."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Love your overall points Alex, but saying that R can't be integrated in web apps is plane wrong!"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,you are smart alex. you do not need to give answers to people on why your preference is your preference. fucking sensitive humans
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Without viewing, the answer is  ... ""the one you know"".  Software is a tool.  It is not the artist."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I think the best thing about R is RMarkdown. Being able to hit one button, run my statistical analysis, and output a word document with all the right numbers and figures in it is amazing for reproducible reporting.
I'm switching to Python soon. Do you have any recommendations for a similar functionality?"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,no web applications? What about shiny etc/??
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I don't uderstand really why do I need to learn R? I already use Python so R looks like big monstrosity. I'm not sure if I'm going to be data analytics or whatever but I'm sure as a rock that knowlege of Python and programming will be so useful no matter in which direction I will go.
R seems to be a tool for stat jerks"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,U R amazing man ❤️👏
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Horrible R Code at 6:33.... yshould be :  library(tidyverse) ;  nba<- read_csv(""nba_2013.csv"") ; mean(nba$colname);      Just as simple as python when you actually know the language you are critiquing............."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I would like to see a second part video comparison focused on comparing R and Python languages from a business standpoint rather than their more general-purpose,  programming capabilities for building applications, and heavy used of sophisticated statistics that do not apply to the average business world. For instance, many of us in business are hoping to learn which language is better for business analysis which, after all, is the trend in using either of these languages. 

What we learn from the video is that R is being highlighted as useful in purely statistical analysis, while the comparison with Python does not provide any insights into Python's capabilities for statistical analysis. R is being highlighted as great for statistical analysis, however, advanced statistics is mostly used by the scientific and academic community mostly as well as sophisticated business environments whereby most of these advanced statistics are not needed in the general business world.

I would like to see the view from a business analyst/business intelligence professional who has truly used both R and Python for exactly the same purpose, using these languages for business analysis. It would be great to move away from the general-purpose and application development and get more into the business uses for each language and on what statistical and data analysis truly serves the vast majority of business users, business intelligence and data analysts analyzing business related data.

Looking forward to this second video. Thanks Alex!"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Concerning which one  is easier to learn/use. 
Depends how you think... 

If you think in functions to solve the problem use R. 
With objects go for Python. 

For me, you can do functional programming style with both Python and R and this is awesome. 

For the R people out there the discussion could be solved with one word: reticulate!!!
We can integrate python in our work flow in whatever form of shape we want it to. 
Even like our beloved  functions =) 

No excuse, learn  both!"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Why not mean(variable) in R's example, it can be short as Python. R is more data wrangling and not application building. Your review lacks that perspective. I suspect you have no experience with data analysis, and if you're an R user you should know that there is no equivalent of dplyr on the Python side."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Thanks for clarification.
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Just calling attention to librarian::shelf(tidyverse)

You don't need to write 10 lines of library(dplyr), you can write all your package name in a single line code and it will automatically install if needed and load it."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Thank you for this video Alex. I have always been intrigued by data analysis and want to learn more of the programming side. I was not familiar with either of these programs but your breakdown of the two help. If I wanted to learn both of these, would it be easier to learn Python first, then try to learn R or should I try to learn about R first, then Python?"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I am an economist trying to dedicate to data analysis and I still didn't understand the pros and cons of both, so this video is exactly what I needed. Thank you! 😄"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,R syntax just makes me angry :) What is wrong with you people? Why are you talking like that?!
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Have you ever used Eviews?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Well I'm have financial background and already learn Python's basic from udemy and YouTube, I guess I'll stick to Phyton. Someone wise said that ""have a deep and specialty on one programming language is better than have understanding on multiple language but only on general"". Learn R again will wasting my time. I'm 30 yo and still have a dream to chase 🔥🔥🔥"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,So then is better the IBM Course (Python) what Google Course (R) ?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Python is unquestionably more straightforward as a language in general. However, it's fundamentally a general-purpose scalar language, not a vector-data language like R or a matrix language like matlab. That fact makes the type of data manipulation and analysis that is meat and potatoes in R less convenient in Python. ""Hello world"" is easier in Python, but real data analysis is easier in R.  I use Python for general programming, but it's just not worth the trouble to force Python to pretend to be R for data analysis, econometrics, or statistics. Python is way, way behind in all forms of data analysis. For example, Python is only now considering basic ideas like ""missing"" values being different from ""not a number"" values, which the creators of R thought of and planned for from day 1. If I had to pick one language as ""better,"" I might choose Python, but it's not better for data analysis, which is what's being discussed here."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,data science and python r ssame
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I am finding that I absolutely despise Python and Visual Studio. I mean I can't even run a simple command in terminal because I don't have pandas? Like, wut? I have been using them in my script for the past 2 hours, now I want to run a few simple commands. Can I not switch between command line and the script? Absolutely unfathomable. Rstudio is soooooooo much better. Not even in same category."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Do pirates prefer R?  Rrrrrr ye matees
1gdKC5O0Pwc,So which tool y'all think would be better for conducting economic and financial analyses?
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"i actually gave up on R as I moved to a more strategic role and away from hardcore data analysis, i found it harder and harder just to recollect syntax across different libraries. Plus I see Industry is tilting more and more towards Python and learning Python is kind of ""future proofing"" your time spent on it."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,Thanks!
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Dear Alex, thanks for your review. However no offense but referring to your arguments, you know veeeery little of R. R objects and visuals in particular can be easily embeded to web apps of any kind. Plotly also exists in R and can be combined with ggplot which a heck of a boost in flexibility. Next up mean of a column in R is as easy as mean(data$column), no need for pipes dude. Therefore with all due respect if you spent more time on Python does not mean that its better and vice versa of course. If R was so lame as u say. Python would not adapt ggplot and more remarkably caret for ML and call it pycaret (like seriously)."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,too brief to be convincing
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"I use both, and sometimes combine them with matlab."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"dude, terrible comparison. you basically said python is better than R because for my personal needs python os better suited. how tf is that an unbiased comparison between the two languages? waste of time"
1gdKC5O0Pwc,"Dear All, 

I am new bein into stats, dS , Ml world, I need your advice on -What would work for me considering below background ? 

Rather then asking which one r or python is best ; first I need to figure out what works form me . .. . 

My brain like : 
For example I am very much comfortable in SQL , DAX  ,Power query style of thinking which are in general some where roughly categorized as functional programming languages my brain loves them 

With SQL ,DAX , Power query -there are only limited keyword and some how my brain can easily figure it out no matter what the scenario is . . I am also very much comfortable with Business intelligence type of work . 

My brain don't like :
On other hand . . My brain just too poorly with C# , Java , Python . . .I simply could not get my head wrap around and I go blank . .
(its not about training or not about trying hard or practicing i tried all that - I just doo poorly with C#, Java , Python kind of languages . most importantly I get freaked out or struggle with fixing console ,compile errors with python ,java etc. 


Do you think I should give R a shot considering my background -or you would feel i would get similar challenges. 

I would like to hear your view Please. . Again I am not lazy to try out . .I did tried . .but you see I would like to take some advice to get me going . ."
1gdKC5O0Pwc,tipical python fanboys thinking their language is good for everything
GQj6_6V_jVA,Why is it comparing case insensitive in the example of substring?
GQj6_6V_jVA,Many thanks for these informative videos and please I'm asking why should we use LTRIM & RTRIM while we can only use TRIM to delete all spaces
GQj6_6V_jVA,Can some employ the UPDATE function in this case?
GQj6_6V_jVA,Using The Office names was dope.
GQj6_6V_jVA,Can’t u use update instead of the replace . Because I used update and it got it done
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex! by running substring code , I didn't get the result in the table??  

select err.FirstName, substring(err.FirstName, 1,3), dem.FirstName, substring(dem.FirstName, 1,3)
From EmployeeErrors err
join EmployeeDemographics dem
 on substring(err.FirstName, 1,3) = substring(dem.FirstName, 1,3)"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"It only showed jim and Pam,  I don't know why it didn't show Toby."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Thank you so much Alex, you've been a great help to my Data analytics journey. I noticed the original inputs on the error table doesn't change after using the TRIM functions, how do we achieve this?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"The fuzzy matching code does not work for TOby on my end, it only works for Jim and Pam"
GQj6_6V_jVA,I did not understand the fuzz matching and why only TOby came as outcome?
GQj6_6V_jVA,"What if we want to filter numbers instead of strings based on first 3 or last 3 values from a column,is there a specific alternative to substring function?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hey alex thanks for the video 
Just a question 
Why do sometime i need to refer to whole database and sometimes just the table name while refering to the tables during join or some other operations ?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"I didn't see bad data at all hahahah It'd not be a surprise if Michael Scott put Fired as the last name of Toby and write it wrong, and put Beasely and Jimbo nicknames as well 😂😂Gotta love the consistency  with the show in this tutorial"
GQj6_6V_jVA,👍
GQj6_6V_jVA,I noticed that some commands were written in lowercase and some in uppercase;  is there a best practice procedure using either format?
GQj6_6V_jVA,great lesson
GQj6_6V_jVA,This was so clever! Thank you!
GQj6_6V_jVA,Learned. Thank you!
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hey Alex,great fan of your work by the way, but the SUBSTRING concept was poorly explained."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Many thanks for
 great tutorial. 🙌🏻"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Using Replace:
Flenderson-fired nothing Changed. Mine didn't work.
Any help"
GQj6_6V_jVA,I am really enjoying this. at first I tried all programming languages but now I think I know what I want. I want to be a data scientist and am sure taking a data analytics course to master these skills first isn't wrong right?
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex, Thanks for the boot camp, Really helpful for newbies. Just a question, Why can't we just use the update command instead of replace,
Like: 
Update EmployeeErrors
Set LastName = 'Flenderson'
Where Firstname = 'Toby'

The outcome is the same."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex, thank you for this tutorial.
 I am getting an error for the substring - Invalid object name ‘EmployeeDemographics’
Please how do I sort this? I’m stuck"
GQj6_6V_jVA,as a fellow office fan and an aspiring data analyst i love your content
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex,
How can we do a proper case in SQL?
Is there a way to do that?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"And if we wanted to  lower case just the second letter of the name TOby for example, or any other name in which the second letter is uppercase we could use the following: 
*LEFT meaning only the letters starting from the LEFT, and the number 1 means only 1 letter. Basically only the first left letter. 
*LEN meaning the length of the name, so basically this will use the maximum length of the name. 
SELECT FirstName, UPPER(LEFT(FirstName,1)) + SUBSTRING(LOWER(FirstName),2,LEN(FirstName)) AS CorrectedName
FROM SQLTutorial..EmployeeErrors

But is there a better and shorter way ?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,i just wanna ask there are upper and lower ..what about the proper is it exist or not ?
GQj6_6V_jVA,this course is very useful and quick not boring at all 😍🤩🤩
GQj6_6V_jVA,"learning this is great, but how can these changes/fixes be made permanent? when i go through the examples, the table with errors still contain the errors and the data doesn't update.."
GQj6_6V_jVA,Why use LTRIM and RTRIM at all? Why not just TRIM everything?
GQj6_6V_jVA,Hello sir can you please make one separate video on substring 🙂
GQj6_6V_jVA,Is this for checking purpose or editing purpose?
GQj6_6V_jVA,"loved the ""Flenderson - Fired"" ... good idea to keep the video informative and fun ... very clever."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"😂😂Not Michael learning SQL to insert 'Fired'

GQj6_6V_jVA,how do i correct table.EmployeeErrors ID-1002 row of extra spacing through sql not manual  replacing
GQj6_6V_jVA,"im a marketing major trying to learn data analytics, i do not have any background in programming so i dont understand the substring function at all I cant imagine a use for it other than getting a few characters from a first name for example. watched it over still dont get it😂"
GQj6_6V_jVA,why do i have two rows of TOby after executing ?
GQj6_6V_jVA,Its not working for me
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex, thank you ones again for putting this together.

I have a little challenge.
The substring didn't fully work for me. The command was right. It displayed only the column but didn't display the datas.
The other string worked just right.

How do I fix this please?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,Thank you! I did learn a lot!
GQj6_6V_jVA,I like those references to The Office 😂
GQj6_6V_jVA,More information on this.... need to watch more than once 😂
GQj6_6V_jVA,Length function can be used to understand change post RTRIM better
GQj6_6V_jVA,1:16 NO GOD! NO GOD!  PLEASE NO!!! NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Thanks Alex, I'm curious if there's a TITLE string command to revert back to ""Title"" case from either ""UPPER"" or ""lower"", something I come across occasionally."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"again this toby caught me offguard, finally toby got fired after didnt get raise salary and got deleted from list XD"
GQj6_6V_jVA,But in reallity you aren´t correcting anything since the SELECT statement jost present a view of the table but altering nothing
GQj6_6V_jVA,Good expalanation thanks
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Why can't you do it as replace(lastname, '-%',' ') ?
Is there a reason you can't use the wild card?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,amazing tutorials
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi, how to fix this.  After creating a table, I can't see  where the table is?Before I had the success of creating a table but now i can't see the table after creating the table, can anyone help me? Thank you"

GQj6_6V_jVA,"Great Video, I was wondering if there is an efficient way to convert the string into Proper case? since SQL doesn't have any PROPER function.."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Can you join on multiple fields? In other words, have multiple ON statements in a single join?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,How can you fix TOby by make only the first letter upper and the rest lower?
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex, I have a question here about using UPPER and lower. How do we make the first letter as UPPER and all other letters following it as lower letters??"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"thnak you for the git hub, can you add that to all your videos? thank you."
GQj6_6V_jVA,"You explain everything so smoothly I appreciate your work! In the last part of this video, is there a way to only lowercase the ""O"" in ""TOby""? Or is it all upper / all lower?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hi Alex, I want to ask what's difference replace and update?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"4:47 Here, ""- Fired"" should be "" - Fired""

GQj6_6V_jVA,Awesome tutorial. Thanks Alex!
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Great video) I got one question, how we can replace last name, here is the situation. I put where condition it did not work

GQj6_6V_jVA,Whoa the sound is suddenly better.
GQj6_6V_jVA,Hi everyone! I don't get it why TOby doesn't appear in my table when I do the Substring.
GQj6_6V_jVA,"I don’t know if this helps, but I found out you can run TRIM, LTRIM, RTRIM, Lower and Upper, all in one go from Select.
Example: SELECT EmployeeID, LTRIM(1002) As IDTRIM, LastName, RTRIM(‘John’) As Name, LastName, UPPER(‘Jim’) As New
FROM EmployeeErrors"
GQj6_6V_jVA,But is this trim and replace stays in the table permanently ?
GQj6_6V_jVA,"This was exactly what I needed for one of my assignments in my course!
Thanks a ton!"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"Hey Alex, awesome video. Do you have a video for Windowing functions?"
GQj6_6V_jVA,"I seem to be having trouble with the REPLACE function. I have the query written out exactly as it is shown on screen, however, the last name is not being changed in  the new column. When I tried to change the last option to change the last name, the same thing happened and nothing new was inputted into the new column. Any advice?"

GQj6_6V_jVA,Apparently you and Michael both hate Toby a lot. First giving him 0.0001% raise and now this.
GQj6_6V_jVA,What's the difference between using the master server and the SQL Tutorial ? l am often confused which one to use usually
GQj6_6V_jVA,"How it could be if I need to change the case of one specific character alone.

-- Select FirstName , Lower(Substring(LastName, 1,1) from Table_Name; --

I’m gonna start school in the next summer ,the studies that I want are statistics with Data science. I wanted to ask you 2 questions:
1. How can I know for sure that I like the data science studies?
2.unfortunately, the first course in the degree is Java and I heard that it’s very hard Compared to python or sql..
I’m new in the programming world and I want to start  the basic python course soon..how can I prepare myself better for the degree and Java studies?

RF0LE3hYFrI,But how to check the script/snippet of the code to see if it does work or not?
RF0LE3hYFrI,Hi I tried your method but I couldn't get the result...

RF0LE3hYFrI,"The data I have in my Excel table is stored as a VARCHAR datatype. Can I use a temporary table to store the converted columns I need, so that I can query from it instead of using the original table every time and converting the datatypes?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,how do i open this console to write words u
RF0LE3hYFrI,Muchas gracias señor Alex 🤠
RF0LE3hYFrI,Wow. Never even thought about this. Would make that information super accessible quickly
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thanks!! Can you make a video explaining schemas?
RF0LE3hYFrI,No need to drop #temp table if you close the current session it will automatically delete from the tempdb 😊
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thank you for this video and for all your tutorials. Question: what is the difference between using a temp table to store a part of a table and using a view to store the same logic and the same part of that table?
RF0LE3hYFrI,love your tutorial Alex. I just don't get the use of temp tables as well as ctes. Like why?
RF0LE3hYFrI,"You can also check the existence of temporary tables using object explorer. In the object explorer, expand TEMPDB database folder, and then exapand TEMPORARY TABLES folder, and you should see the temporary table that we have created."
RF0LE3hYFrI,does it show up in the object explorer
RF0LE3hYFrI,Its a very interesting idea
RF0LE3hYFrI,"How to insert values in cells in a table in SQL where first column is filled with values while the 2nd and 3rd columns are not?(eg: employeeid, age, jobtitle are the three columns, employeeid is filled with values like 100 to 300 while the other 2 columns are empty and has to be filled, will it have to be done one by one or is there any other way?)"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Wow, love this!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,What is the difference between materialized view and a temp table then? I had this qiestion after watching this video. I know materialized view also allows us to do the same thing and improve the processing by retrieving already stored query and the result and make it quicker to retrieve the data.
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Thanks for the good content created for free, it is very useful. I would like to add a little bit of information, if you use one # sign the temp table would be considered local (you can use it only in your currect query window), if you use double ## sign the table would be global (you can use it in a new query window). As they mentioned before, when you close the session the tables will be gone forever, so you need to create them again. My two cents!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Alex would you consider a one on  one training?
RF0LE3hYFrI,"I don't understand why you didn't demonstrate the easy way to create a temp table. The INTO statement.  You could have created a temp table without the pain of the create statement.

select * into #emp from Employee where age =30 

This would give you a complete temp table without out having to set up a create statement every time."
RF0LE3hYFrI,"I have been using mysql, but when I use drop table if exists, it shows error in my syntax, 
Is there any other way to query for my sql"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Wait so you drop and create a table on each query? Or  how is the data updated? Why wouldn't you just use views?
RF0LE3hYFrI,"if OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#temp_Employee') is not null
    drop table #temp_Employee
  create table #temp_Employee (
  EmployeeID int,
  JobTitle varchar(100),
  Salary int
  )

  Select *
  From #temp_Employee

insert into #temp_Employee values (
'1001', 'HR', '45000'



I don't know why I am not able to insert values ?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Ha, first watch looks difficult, i'll re-watch to understand. I go again."
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Hi Alex, how did you populate the table #temp_Employee using the command...Select  * From SQLTutorial..EmployeeSalary? It seems very practical but I don't know where those values came from!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,(drop table  if exists ) doesn't work in sql 2014?!
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Shoot, this is genius! Computational efficiency."
RF0LE3hYFrI,"why am i facing issue in creating a temp table

CREATE TABLE #temp_Employee (
EmployeeID int,
JbbTitle varchar(100),
Salary int
)


where input is this And output is that

ERROR:  syntax error at or near ""#""
LINE 1: CREATE TABLE #temp_Employee (

But its running smoothly when I am using this as an input

 CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table (
EmployeeID int,
JobTitle varchar(100),
Salary int
)"
RF0LE3hYFrI,I just want to say thank you so much for your video's I have learnt more today than I have ever known about SQL and will continue subscribe. You are a HUGE help!!
RF0LE3hYFrI,Incredible video!! I did have an error message creating #temp_Employee2 but I see a column was missing for EmployeesPerJob COUNT(  and deleted that part of the script and it ran correctly! Wow I love this stuff
RF0LE3hYFrI,Awesome content! Learning a ton!
RF0LE3hYFrI,what do you mean when you use the expression hit off ??? is very confusing
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Wow! I love the ""DROP TABLE IF EXISTS..."" command. Really useful too! Thanks Alex. You're GREAT!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Hey Alex, what is the difference between ""Ultimate Beta Course Bundle"" to """"Lifetime Access to Analyst Builder""?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Hi Great tutorial. I have question about dropping table. I understand that it is done not to get an error. But why to again and again create and insert data into temporary table since we are using it to reduce calculation load. If we do it over and over again are we not adding unnecessary calculation load? Why, once the temporary table is created and filled, don't we rather delete or comment out those CREATE and INSERT INTO queries? Thanks Michal"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thank you Alex.
RF0LE3hYFrI,Ten minutes goes by fast. This was much needed.
RF0LE3hYFrI,The first use case is not really straightforward to me. Can someone point me to a different example that I might find more clear please?
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thanks Alex
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Alex often uses the expression to hit sth. off of sth. What does it mean? To copy? To extract? I tried to google this expression, but couldn't find anything that would apply to this context. Can anyone help?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Can anyone explain what the number is  we put inside parenthese in fron of VARCHAR?
RF0LE3hYFrI,I don't think # is a pound sign. I call it a hash sign. :)
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Hi Alex, kindly explain the difference between 'text' and 'varchar' and why you have to use a parenthesis right after the varchar?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thanks for this Alex!
RF0LE3hYFrI,"For those who are working with mysql, the view statement is used as temp tables. I wrote the query in this way:

CREATE view temp_Employee as 
SELECT demo.EmployeeID, sal.JobTitle, sal.Salary
FROM employeedemographics demo
JOIN employeesalary sal
ON demo.EmployeeID=sal.EmployeeID;"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"When I inserted values, I got two the same rows while I did the same as you. Do you know why two same rows has been created for me (EmployeeID: 1001)?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Nice and easy thanks
RF0LE3hYFrI,"For anyone following along in postgreSQL, use TEMP or TEMPORARY to create your temporary tables. Unfortunately, postgreSQL doesn't recognize the # sign in creating temp tables. 
EX:

CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_employee(
employeeid INT,
jobtitle VARCHAR(100),
salary INT
);"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Where can I find the temp table
RF0LE3hYFrI,"These tutorials are amazing! Thanks so much, Alex. Question: Why would a person use a temp table if it is just session-specific. Why wouldn't one just create a new table using a past query so that it is stored permanently, for use later?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Liking the video even before start watching it.
That's the faith I have on Alex."
RF0LE3hYFrI,"can you explain the meaning of varchar? i get the int as integer type of data, but what is varchar? why not put string?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thanks a lot!
RF0LE3hYFrI,Nice
RF0LE3hYFrI,Great tutorial! This is like querying a query. I’m learning a lot from your videos. Thank you Alex
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Hello Alex, Could you please explain the difference between Temp tables and CTEs. Also, when should you use which one?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Done
RF0LE3hYFrI,thank You Sr <3
RF0LE3hYFrI,How do i improve the skill of knowing different ways to write a code for the same output. Does learning python improves vocabulary of coding?  I am aspiring data analyst and i want to master this skill of yours? plz reply....u speak simple and clear in ur videos. Thanks.
RF0LE3hYFrI,Hi Alex your tutorial are game-changing for me. can we combine a temporary table and cte
RF0LE3hYFrI,Why not to use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS instead of dropping it and re-creating it again ?
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Thanks, really helfpul."
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Helpful video, especially the DROP TABLE tip. Thank you sir"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"I normally use drop table if exists #temp, #temp2 
For multiple tables, do u know a way to drop more then 3 tables without listing them 

Eg I have 10 temp tables , 
Instead of using this syntax drop table if exists #temp, #temp2 , etc 

Is there a better way to do this?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Great helpful tutorials.
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Is it advisable to use a #TempTable when importing data in PowerBi for a ""DirectQuery"".  So when Alex has the DROP TABLE IF EXIST... and we would refresh our query, would we get the latest data imported and stored in our #TempTable or would PowerBI not even be able to bring back results?  Thanks and I am getting more from this free course than my paid subscriptions!  Great job Alex!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Thank you, Alex. You give the quickest easy-to-understand tutoring I have received on my DA journey. You explain these things well, and you do not overload the learner with more than they need per time. 
One helpful thing I do is practice while I watch and play around with it as you teach. I often break something, though, and that helps too."
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Thanks much alot 

Whenever I created and inserted data in temp table and shut down my computer and come back and select the temp table it doesn’t work I have to Crete and insert datas again and again when ever I come back into it. 
Can you please give me some solution for me 
Thanks"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Yes, I like this video 😀
Thank you!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Great video tutorial
RF0LE3hYFrI,Such a great example. I was looking for a solution for something I’m working on at work and this is ‘drop table is exist’ is perfect. Thank you.
RF0LE3hYFrI,"I want to retrieve a row by a max value in a specific column…
Example: I have location, date, and temperature columns. I want to have max temperature in each location with corresponding date. Anyone can help?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Great thanks 👍👌
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Simple and functional as always, thanks Alex, data loves you! :)"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Thank you but I don't understand the advantage of temp tables. Would ot using queries without them be faster? You just added more steps. This is my first time seeing a video regarding temp tables btw.
RF0LE3hYFrI,"I got exactly the information I was looking for and I started following your channel, thanks."
RF0LE3hYFrI,Once again a great tutorial!! This is the next concept in the Google data analytics course. Thank you so much you made it smooth digestible.
RF0LE3hYFrI,I would like to ask a question. is there any book that you suggest to read for SQL Server?  I want a book with full 100% documentation and to learn in deep SQL server.
RF0LE3hYFrI,"super, thank you"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Whats the point of creating a temp table over a regular view? Is it mainly to do with storage efficiencies. Why not just Drop the table when you're down with it? Or is it because temp tables are good for stored procedures because its more efficient? thanks! just trying to figure it out
RF0LE3hYFrI,i lost you in creating #temp _employee2.. why did you use select in the insert funct. ............
RF0LE3hYFrI,You know what's magical / lifesaving?  Putting a query result in  a temp table.
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Geat tutorial. Please, what do the two dots (..) between the table and column mean? Thanks for the video!"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Hello Alex, thanks for these videos. How can I delete duplicates on my table?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,"3:47 not quite sure, but could someone clarify what “SQLTutorial..” is referencing in the FROM clause here? I understand “EmployeeSalary” is the table we’re storing into the temp table, but “SQLTutorial..” seems kinda random - I’m assuming this is the name of the database “EmployeeSalary” is from but was it necessary to add that?

Thanks anyone,"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Это лучшее видео на свете
RF0LE3hYFrI,"Shall we add multiple rows from multiple tables into temp table, if column names are same in temp table ?"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Very useful trick..Thank you so much
RF0LE3hYFrI,What would happen if groupby columns names were different than the tem_table column names?
RF0LE3hYFrI,What an idiotic explanation.
RF0LE3hYFrI,Nitro shot of knowledge to the brain just when I needed it 💯
RF0LE3hYFrI,Amazing tutorial as always :)
RF0LE3hYFrI,hey Alex can you help me find a platform where i can practise these queries on different tables other than creating them.
RF0LE3hYFrI,Gold content!
RF0LE3hYFrI,"good explanation, thanks"
RF0LE3hYFrI,That was not helpful at all… I still don’t know that works dude and how to use this.
RF0LE3hYFrI,Instead of doing DROP TABLE IF EXISTS - what about CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS...?
RF0LE3hYFrI,"The copy paste part--

Insert into #temp_Employee2
Select JobTitle,count(jobtitle),Avg(age),AVG(Salary)
From EmployeeDemographics emp
join EmployeeSalary sal
	on emp.EmployeeID=sal.EmployeeID
Group by JobTitle"
RF0LE3hYFrI,Alex Thanks man! All the way from South Africa
8o-O6pR6yAE,is the IBM certificate data analyst COURSE RECOMMENDED OR THE TEN COURSES YOU MENTION BEFORE
8o-O6pR6yAE,"Which one is best ?
Data analyst
Data scientist
Data engineer 
???"
8o-O6pR6yAE,Heres a another topic for your next video: Video on SAS. How impo that it and basics.
8o-O6pR6yAE,Can you make a video of how you use excel as a data analyst? I know there are a bunch of videos out there but you explain very well!!
8o-O6pR6yAE,Why do you say Tableau is better than Power BI? Maybe a comparison video incoming?
8o-O6pR6yAE,"Hey man these are great thanks for all your content! I am working on the certificates you mentioned in previous videos and am looking into internships around the ATL area to get my foot in the door. No degree and just recently dropped out of Thinkful's Full Stack Flex program despite being close to graduation due to wanting to pivot into Data Analytics. I wish I would've found your content sooner. Thanks again, you keep me motivated!"
8o-O6pR6yAE,"Hello Mr. Alex. First of all, thanks for all your videos!  I have a question for you.  What kind of system do you recommend to implement in a small or medium-sized company in order to obtain raw data for later analysis?"
8o-O6pR6yAE,"Why would anyone waste time on such a worthless certificate? I have not found a single job post where this cert was even mentioned. No company thinks of IBM when discussing ML tools, please save yourself some time and focus on real world projects!"
8o-O6pR6yAE,Cozy environment !
8o-O6pR6yAE,I was thinking this video have the full IBM course for free but no problem.
8o-O6pR6yAE,"Oh man, if you bring tutorials i would definitely get your material."
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you for this video very clear and concise. I am considering going into a career in data analytics and came across the IBM certificate program but wanted to learn more about it before paying for the courses. I have a BS degree in Business Admin Management and really looking to do a career change. This video helps.
eFDbE5Yunj0,Alex the way you explain everything  that's awsome. 👌🏻
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks Alex
eFDbE5Yunj0,Does it need good knowledge of Microsoft excel and word prior to the course?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you sir
eFDbE5Yunj0,hi can i do more than one week of work in one go ?
eFDbE5Yunj0,If you fail to pass the certificate then what happened?
eFDbE5Yunj0,What type questions will be there in last assignment
eFDbE5Yunj0,Do y’all think I can complete this in 7 days? 😭 I have all the time in the world.
eFDbE5Yunj0,Peer grading is a joke.  So someone who not even got their grade which could have been an F is grading me.  It’s stupid.  I normally just check their code and for projects I basically just skim through what they had written.
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can you stack the courses and combine at the end instead of purchasing the whole thing ?
eFDbE5Yunj0,should we need to complete all the 9  courses to get the certification or we get certificate for each separate course
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hey Alex, just a quick question. Do they talk about data science mathematical concepts too?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,which one is better the ibm or google one
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is IBM Data engineer certificate for beginners? Pls anyone tell me
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can we access this course through audit for free?
eFDbE5Yunj0,great analysis alex. definitely taking the course but i noticed it's been updated and now has 9 modules as opposed to the 8 in your video. They added a Python Project for Data Science. Will you be updating the video?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hey Alex!  It's 2023.  I was in the middle of taking this certification in early 2023, but stopped for a month, and now it's May  and I've looked into returning to my studies, I noticed that the IBM course no longer is offering Python, but instead R.  Any insights?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,I just finished high school and don't think I'm going to go in college yet because of some financial and family issues but I want start this professional course. My query is what is the next step is going to be when I complete this? And am I going to get a well paid job right away after finishing this course???
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I have DataCamp and I just got the IBM Data Analyst professional certificate course from coursera. I'm not a data Analyst YET but so far I find DataCamp waaaay more hands on!! Ive completed several courses at DataCamp and I absolutely LOVE! I got the IBM one this past week and I'm still on module one and OMG... tooooooo much blah blah blah and I'm about to finish the first module and although the information is good, zero SQL, EXCEL, PYTHON...like NADA. Just a lot of talking about Data structure and etc. Can't wait to finish the module 1 to see if it changes."
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Really sorry, but this is an overview review of the IBM data analyst course. I am currently doing this right now and some of the courses, such as, 3 and 4, are challenging as the tutors are disinterested in teaching, does not explain complicated concepts properly and you must have a good knowledge of python programming before enrolling.
Also, the 4 and a half/5 star review of the course is an over statement.
Anyone planning on doing this, I would highly recommend you to have a good read of the comments and reviews.
Thank you very much."
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey Alex. Recent college grad here with a bachelors or science in IT currently studying for AWS certs. I eventually want to become a data scientist but I first want to get some experience working with data and go for a data analyst position. Is it a good idea if I do the IBM data science cert instead of the data analytics one? and then learn tableau on my own. Also do you recommend any sql or Spark certs?
eFDbE5Yunj0,This was extremely helpful as I was looking into Google certs. It seems as IBM does give a lot more for the same price and is teaching me skills are was interested in learning as well but on the side of learning this.
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can I do the excel component in Libre Office (Calc)?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Remarkable content. Quick question, if I may, when it comes to sponsored content from Coursera? Would you recommend flat fee only or with commission on top? I run a small edu YT channel."
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I'm currently in the middle of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Do you recommend I take the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate next, or is it about the same info and I should move onto a different course?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is this certified by IBM???or Google??
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks for sharing!
eFDbE5Yunj0,You are the one that has sealed the deal for me in moving forward! thank you so much for your clear insight.
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hi thanks for your review was really insightful. One question that’s I have is what should be my next step ? Like which course would you recommend to do after completing this one .? Thank  you
eFDbE5Yunj0,"The course is a joke, one the worst courses online I have ever done. Online instruction is terrible, plenty of problems on Coursera, online support worst I have ever come across. Poorly structured, poorly exampled, poor help. Just a bad joke and I have done many online courses, this by far the worst one."
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi Alex, big fan of your videos. I'm currently taking this course, and you're right, it's not really super advanced, but it's just what I need since I'm a beginner. I was curious if you have any suggestions for next steps? Are there intermediate/advanced courses that'll give me more practical experience? Or should I go on and start looking for internships and such?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can I follow this IBM data analyst program using Google sheet instead of Microsoft Excel?
eFDbE5Yunj0,What job is an entry level job? And also is a certification equal to a degree?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Please review edureka data analytics 🙏
eFDbE5Yunj0,May I know what’s the total cost?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I'm taking this course right now. Honestly these courses are so buggy, the lessons are either oversimplified or too complicated, I don't feel like I learned a thing, particularly in some of the Python courses. The whole process was incredibly frustrating. The moderators are helpful and answer your questions quickly and fix your problems, but having so many issues is really disruptive to the learning process and I feel like I'm going to have to do a lot more independent studying to actually learn the skills this course was supposed to teach me. On its surface it looks clean and polished, but I don't recommend taking it as it's so surfacy and you'll end up just having to take another one anyway."
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hey, is this course outdated for 2022?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,I've got a question about Coursera what I haven't found in their Q and A-s : if you subscribe for their monthly payment how will this work? like in Patreon? they take the money in the first day of the month or the payment is for a month from a day you started your subscription?
eFDbE5Yunj0,will you be able to get an immediate job after completing an IBM certificate?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Not worth it! The IBM Cloud access always fails and this prevents you from performing assignments. So stressful. Looking at the discussion forums in the course other learners encounter the same thing as well. Wonder why they never get it fixed. They should've stuck with simulators. This is the error message: Error Your account cannot be created at this time. Code: 327cbf60-543a-49ca-abff-c46d9403d55d
eFDbE5Yunj0,I’m already taking the google data analytics course. Would it be good to take this one as well after or just work on portfolio projects?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Great Video 👍
May I know the validly of this certification I mean IBM data analytics certification?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,YOU FORGOT TO MENTION THAT YOU WOULD ALSO NEED A DEGREE
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hello Alex, is the peer grading too subjective? Also, how does it impact the entire grading and the progress made during the course? Thank you for sharing"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Does this certificate have an expiry date, just like the google data analytics professional certificate, which is 1 year?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I hope your are honest and not paid to give positive review for the course. I am right now at the middle of the course. Honestly, Excel, and Cognos related courses are great! However, Python part is not so useful in terms of getting real coding skills, and I enrolled to the course mainly because of Python for Data Analysis. The problem (if briefly) is that it doesn't really explain the logic of coding, which would allow you to continue learning by yourself further. Instead it just give commands and you need just run them. They skip many parts while explaining how codes works. 

I hope at least the Certificate itself would have an impact in the eye of employer.

But if you are really honest (I really hope so), and the job prospect is so indeed good with the the certificate I feel very optimistic."
eFDbE5Yunj0,3:20 I recently enrolled in this program. I am new to this “peer graded” assignment procedure
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for the meaningful sharing. But 25% off is no longer available, can we wait for its return?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"You are an amazing man who inspire people. I watch your videos with a smile on my face, knowing that I'm getting closer to my dream of becoming a data analyst. Thank you so much for being here for us"
eFDbE5Yunj0,I majored in Religious Studies and minored in Economics in college. Do you think it would be wise to do this certificate to get an entry level analyst job?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi Alex,
Thanks for your video.  What is the difference between this course offered on Coursera and edX?  From what I can see, on Coursera it's $39/month and you pay however long it takes you to complete it.  But on edX it's about $800 but you can take as long was you want to finish it?  Seems like Coursera is the better deal."
eFDbE5Yunj0,Hey Alex I love the channel. What’s the difference between this course and the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate? A video on this would also be great!
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi Alex, Amazing videos you have! One question for you and for everyone. I actually work for the militaries and I don't have a degree, but I want to change careers. Would it be possible for me to get a job in an entry level position as a data analyst after finishing the IBM data analyst certificate??"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks so much Alex...I'm finding these courses to be pretty light. As you point out they are a good intro to some of the tools. I really can't imagine these courses preparing your for real work...I really don't have a lot of confidence in them.  It would be really nice if someone could come up with some intermediate  and advanced courses that use these tool sets  and get us more job ready....
eFDbE5Yunj0,I am in the process of completing a degree in Business with a major Project Management I’m wanting to make a transition from finance into data analytics
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Thanks for the review Alex. I breezed through the first 3 courses in this certificate and felt super confident I could nail this in a couple of months time. I must admit it got super hard from course 4 - Python for Data Science, AI & Development. The learning curve is exponential. Each of those 7-15 min videos took me 4-5 hours to complete with contact pauses-plays. The Python in this course is definitely not for beginners. I completed the 4th course just for the sake of it but I don't believe I have mastered any of the skills. Maybe I'm not cut out for this program and should start from ground zero like comptia itf+ or Google IT Support. But data analysis/science is something I would wish to pursue"
eFDbE5Yunj0,What about the IBM and Google data analysis together?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Great video, Alex! May I also ask if I finished the whole courses, is it possible for me to find a job related to this course in the future without having any educational background aside from this online course?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Thank you for this video. So according to your description of the content of the course, and the fact that I'm finishing my Software Engineering degree soon,  I have done a lot of work on python, pandas, SQL and that I'm currently working a little bit with tensorflow and its documentation. Do you think this course can add anything new??"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I want to switch from Accounting to Tech ( data science), are there  other certificates you suggest getting after achieving this one?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Thank you
I got so much pleasure at this course and still in it and more excited to complete it all.
I've heard they offer courses for free on coursera for certain people or by chance.
does any one of you guys know about that?
I dont have any method to pay where i live"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Is it worth doing both Google and IBM certificates? Asking because I just completed the Google one, and I want to learn Python for data science."
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Absolutely valuable 🙏 Thanks a billion, Alex 🥂 I had a very bad knee injury that made me stay home for almost a couple months now, I was getting so frustrated until I came across your channel and I’m now in the middle of my 3rd week already 🎊 Thanks again and keep it the awesome work"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanku so much for share all detail in deep. finally I found a video which clear my all doubts 😌
eFDbE5Yunj0,is this course really hard?
eFDbE5Yunj0,is it worth it getting an IBM AI Engineer professional certification?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Question 🙋🏻‍♀️ is it possible to do it in one month for a completely free person? Cus after seeing this video i feel like i can, but I wanna make sure of it first😂"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you for your content! I relay enjoy watching and it helps me shape my decisions :) I am currently taking this course and also saw your video about the Google Data Analytics Course. Wich of the two Courses would you consider to give me better chances to get an entry lever job?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Please tell me whether I should go for Data Science or Data Analysis??
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I'm using Macbook Air M1, Is it also possible to do data analysis there? Thank you."
eFDbE5Yunj0,Alex what would you recommend IBM or Google Data analytics certification?
eFDbE5Yunj0,would you recommend IBM or Google certificate ?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks Alex for the Video.Please I need to know the prospects of getting a job after doing this.Do they assist in giving Jobs or connecting people to employers
eFDbE5Yunj0,Which is good for beginners Google Data analytics or IBM ?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is it worth it for Financial Analyst?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I love these courses. Straight to the point, no bullshit, and tells you exactly how long it’s going to take."
eFDbE5Yunj0,I love you videos !!! I’ve been thinking about getting into data analytics it’s something I’m interested in!! Your helping me be more confident about it !!!
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Yes, now IBM or Google? Any initial thoughts?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,I arrived to your video late Alex...the discount was ended 😭 but your review is very helpful. Thank you so much!
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you man ❤️❤️
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Has anyone completed the certification? If so, how has it helped you in your career?"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Great video!! 1 question. Does the certificate cost any and if yes how much?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is the cirtificate given by IBM  or the Coursera?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Do you need to have the basics of phyton before entering this course?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"I think it is worth it to give it a try, especially since 2 years ago I have completed IBM Data Science and it is worth it, I assume this type of course, is the same as before, nice insights!"
eFDbE5Yunj0,How to take advantage of the 25% discount?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi! Just came across this course via EdEx and upon further investigation found out you can take it through coursera as well. Why is there a price difference (are they both covering the same stuff)? 

Also, I have an MD degree and some time to kill before residency starts, would this course help out in medicine in any way? Research etc? Nonetheless, would nice to acquire this extra skill. Thanks for creating this video!"
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thanks for the video. Is it possible to complete it in one month? I have a time and already familiar with the content and want to add this certification on top of my bootcamp experience. I’m trying to add certifications to compensate for the lack of a bachelors degree. I’m considering this and the IBM Mathematics for Machine Learning
eFDbE5Yunj0,Love this channel!!
eFDbE5Yunj0,"OK what about
data science speciation offer by John Hopkins University 🎓"
eFDbE5Yunj0,What coursera courses should i take or enroll in to becole a business intelligence specialist
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is laptop needed for the course?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"Hi is the 25% off link still available?-----------😅alright. I missed it. only 4days"
eFDbE5Yunj0,"As a beginner with no programming knowledge learning for 1.5 months now, the Capstone Project was really hard, and the courses previously provided were structured very poorly with no real world practises to strengthen the knowledge. Its not just my thoughts either, tons of people in Coursera have the same experiences and are reviewing it 1 star because of it."
eFDbE5Yunj0,you don’t have to pay for the course... AUDIT THE COURSE!!!! then it’s FREEEEEE
eFDbE5Yunj0,Thank you Alex for these videos. They’re really helpful and I think I’ve watched more than half of them over the last few months 👌🏾
eFDbE5Yunj0,Can the certificate learning time be shortened?
eFDbE5Yunj0,Is it worth obtaining a information system post-bacc?
eFDbE5Yunj0,"hi
whats your opinion about that course on coursera""Applied Data Science with python ""?"
D9bNctNnAig,DataCamp is OK for a superficial overview but not more. You can save your money and look this up on YouTube yourself
D9bNctNnAig,they need to learn to stop scamming
D9bNctNnAig,I am making a career transition from engineering to data science. DataCamp has provided me with two years of valuable experience in basic and intermediate-level coding. I am supplementing it with platforms that provide a more theoretical foundation. I am quite pleased with it; it serves as an excellent practice and reference tool.
D9bNctNnAig,If I could decide for myself why would I look at you for 16min
D9bNctNnAig,Are this free?
D9bNctNnAig,Thank you for making this video.
D9bNctNnAig,For course certification....what does practical exam refers to??
D9bNctNnAig,"I’ve just joined datacamp and running through Data Analyst in Tableau career track. 
Being almost 3 years in role with Tableau, but still not confident to say I’m proficient enough in it.
Good recap of all bits and pieces.

Honestly, Ive skipped videos from beginner and intermediate sections- just worked on exercises.
For me it is beneficial compared to Udemy."
D9bNctNnAig,As a complete beginner wanted to get started in data analytics would you recommend data camp or just taking the Google cert?
D9bNctNnAig,How I wish they had Java Career path courses.
D9bNctNnAig,l have a question ..... after doing these course  do you get a physical certificate?
D9bNctNnAig,You are the Best broh!
D9bNctNnAig,"I have been using Datacamp for over 5 years on and off. The best way to learn is to have 3 things open at the same time ChatGPT, an IDE for SQL or Python, R (etc.) for whatever you  are learning to practice full code on the spot and trial and error, and data camp.
After each major lesson on Data Camp write the whole code on your own and use data camp to give your more context and clear example or to generate data for your small projects. This is the best way to actually retain information. The short Data camp videos may lack context or depth Chat GPT can help.
Data Camp is useful for curriculum and exposure. It provides an outline of in demand skills needed. Avoid taking course in any platform that all they do is go over a programming language from A to Z like a dictionary, you will not be able to retain and is not necessary to learn everything. Just learn the skills you need to succeed for the industry you want to be in and practice doing real life projects that interests you."
D9bNctNnAig,"Thank you, that was super informative!"
D9bNctNnAig,"I’m learning how to use Power BI, is there a way to download the same data they use in the video lectures so to gain hands on experience?"
D9bNctNnAig,done
D9bNctNnAig,"DataCamp is waste of money, after chatGPT. I subscribed to it for 2 years and now no more. YouTube is the best to learn any skills."
D9bNctNnAig,"Well spoken - I like your presentations, easy to understand. Fair and honest review. What you described here is what I also observed when using DataCamp."
D9bNctNnAig,boring
D9bNctNnAig,"Thank you for the review. It does give a good overview.
One con I found for me is that it doesn't have an offline feature. Hence you can't do any part of the courses unless you have constant internet connection."
D9bNctNnAig,for latino people 2 55 dollars per month BELIEVE ME ITS EXTREAMLY EXPENSIVE
D9bNctNnAig,Thank you for good info
D9bNctNnAig,"For me, definitely worth it"
D9bNctNnAig,Can you suggest where a novice should start?
D9bNctNnAig,I have a big issue with creating a project for portfolio with very little knowledge
D9bNctNnAig,"I did data analytics with Google that had no python . And for the person who knows nothing  about python. I think it's going to be perfect. 
What do u think?"
D9bNctNnAig,"$25 a month is a lot different than having to slap down $300 for the year ,  at least for me. Can’t just pay for a few months and cancel. You left that part out. 😬 

Right now doing Udemy do to budget restraints. Going into more cc debt isn’t super appealing. 

Would you say sticking with Udemy would be a better option? I’m working on the advanced level of a Udemy course but haven’t really done much with other Udemy courses. 

Thoughts?
Personally leaning towards sticking with Udemy. 
Thanks"
D9bNctNnAig,"Great video! I have a question, which one would an employer look at the most, the data camp data analytics certificate or the goggle advanced data analytics certificate? Thank you and have a great day!"
D9bNctNnAig,"Hi, I completed the Data Analyst with Python course. My main concern is that do certifications expire as soon as you have completed them? And is it worthwhile to mention on my resume/linkedin?"
D9bNctNnAig,"I got a yearly subscription at roughly 60 usd. I think the courses are pretty decent for self learner begginers and the certification and job offers are good perks for those living in  USA, Canada and Europe."
D9bNctNnAig,Is it free ?
D9bNctNnAig,100% worth it.
D9bNctNnAig,"Today,  Dec 2022, the Premium subscription for individual is $59(5$ / month) billed annually  It worst for me although I bought for learning SQL back =)"
D9bNctNnAig,"Very useful, thanks for video!"
D9bNctNnAig,Thanks for the review Alex. Beyond syntax it's a relief to simply start coding without dealing with machine setup. I've given up too many times just trying to set up my environment. Such a waste. This seems promising.
D9bNctNnAig,Do companies accept applicant who graduated in Datacamp or In shortcourses?
D9bNctNnAig,Hi any one needs data camp subscription for a year please reply
D9bNctNnAig,"My men, i got a sell off of 60USD/year. 100% recommended"
D9bNctNnAig,"Bro,which to take as beginner  data camp or Google data analytics certificate?"
D9bNctNnAig,"What I hate about them 'data camp' is that they didn't updated the payment system for subscription in India
The reserve Bank of India put out a mandate asking all international cos to update their payments system acc to indian standards but many didn't comply
Now even if I want to i couldn't access to datacamp premium subscription"
D9bNctNnAig,What about 365 data science?
D9bNctNnAig,Now it's showing for just $5.75/month is it worth it?
D9bNctNnAig,"Hey Alex, so I have a Master's in Data Analytics. Do you think Data camp is good for someone that needs brushing or wants to learn programs that I didn't learn in my program? For example, I didn't learn Power BI or R and my jobs requires alot of Power BI."
D9bNctNnAig,"To be clear, the $25 ""monthly"" fee is paid as an annual subscription, so you will actually be charged a one-time annual fee of $300.  If you do choose to pay monthly, then the cost is steeper, at $39.  Still a cool website, and I'm tempted, but that gives me a little more pause to consider; if I could pay $25 each month, I would probably do it immediately."
D9bNctNnAig,"Thanks for the review. I think it’s for me because I’m a total beginner, and will use it to supplement my learning while I take the BS Data Management Data Analytics program at WGU."
D9bNctNnAig,"Hello, I am a 4th year student of Statistics. I have enrolled for Google Data Analytics on Coursera. Is it good?"
D9bNctNnAig,"data camp is worth it ... though after you should work on big datasets with multivariable analysis to show you know awesome analysis
also you should know the time is way longer when you get to harder material"
D9bNctNnAig,"I like the R courses because they help you apply any theoretical knowledge you've learned about statistics in school like Machine Learning, etc. I like the Python courses because they're fun especially the guided projects. I've used the videos for my classes, it helps me go above and beyond what is expected from the professor."
D9bNctNnAig,"Today,  May 2022, the Premium subscription for individual is $12.42, billed annually"
D9bNctNnAig,fair review from a fair unbiased analyst :D
D9bNctNnAig,Thanks Alex for the summary of data camp.
D9bNctNnAig,Question: What website would you recommend for someone with NO experience and no base knowledge? I am currently getting a degree in Cybersecurity and what to learn more in general.
D9bNctNnAig,Okay I am a beginner and I must be the only one who hates Data Camp.  The videos are too fast.  I can't follow.  Then they make you do the query and with no example to reference unless you go back to video.  I am so frustrated.
D9bNctNnAig,Great video! The most relevant aspect to me are the projects. Could you recommend another platform with end-to-end solved project? I need to start my BI machine learning portfolio... Thank you!
D9bNctNnAig,can u gey any type of a job with
D9bNctNnAig,"Your channel has been immensely helpful for me figuring out where the hell to start! I am currently on Codecademy on the DA path as well as taking the SQL on the side. I am also learning through YOU and youtube videos. I started Datacamp, but I agree with alot of the  commenters. Just code snippets and such. Codecademy actually has me doing off-platform work and learning how to migrate data through PostgreSQL. Anyway, thanks Alex!"
D9bNctNnAig,"Damn, that's a good point about the lack of IDE usage. I learnt SQL on a similar platform, Codecademy, and loved it, but then I tried opening up SQL server to start my own project and felt like a headless chicken"
D9bNctNnAig,"For advanced level, I basically think there is simply nothing you can learn online, there are piles of thick books with academic levels out there, why bother yourself with online unfiltered cheap infos?"
D9bNctNnAig,"I started a month ago, got the annual subscription. I like the variety of topics they have, I feel like it's perfect for someone with no prior knowledge and just getting familiar with programming. I complement the theory with Coursera."
D9bNctNnAig,should i do a year?
D9bNctNnAig,What’s the difference between this and W3 school ?
D9bNctNnAig,Datacamp is terrible. Their videos are more like presentations than they are videos that teach a concept or skill. Do not waste your time or money. You can learn more right here on YT by much better instructors that use superior teaching methods.
D9bNctNnAig,hello guys if you're in University you can get it free for 3 monthsss
D9bNctNnAig,If I’m studying cyber security would Datacamp be useful to me?
D9bNctNnAig,Which e-learning platform do you recommend for learning more advanced topics related to data science? Is plitalsight a good one?
D9bNctNnAig,lol
D9bNctNnAig,"Hi Alex! Just a quick question. I’m trying to switch my career and I felt in love with analytics about seven months ago and I’ve took the google data analytics course, I bought some books you recommend etc but my question is. How many years did you spent by studying all the courses before you apply for the job. I ask that not because I’m lazy but because I’m 35 already and sometimes I think is a bit late for me... thanks!"
D9bNctNnAig,"Why are python fanboys such snobs? R was was built for data science. Anyway, I’ll go watch somebody else’s channel now"
D9bNctNnAig,which platform would you suggest for advanced users to learn some advanced algorithms and efficient methods to solve any problem? thanks!
D9bNctNnAig,"hi there, a quick question: so how many courses can you take until you are ask to have subscription?  thanks.."
D9bNctNnAig,"$25 a month...billed annually, which is a lot up front. If you do monthly, it's $29. If you want the ""tier"" with the projects, that'll be $33 a month paid annually or $49 monthly . It's not a cheap service."
D9bNctNnAig,"I think it's important to supplement Datacamp with other resources.  Maybe some others like Coursera/Udemy for some high level theory.  Like you said, it's great for learning syntax and for beginners who need a lot of spoon feeding.  I am learning Python and SQL on this platform right now.  After a a short video, we jump into these exercises with fill-in-the-blanks without knowing  what server it is using, how to upload datasets into the server, and sometimes what the goal of a problem is.  It takes you to a screen and you just starting filling in the blanks. It doesn't reflect real life.  Datacamp is valuable for learning technical skills (and I really like their user interface), but I think newbies need additional resources."
D9bNctNnAig,"I came here wondering if I should pay fro datacamp premium. After watching this video I didn't feel informed enough to make decision, I did find this video from Jen at The Career Force very helpful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7itLZQ_yjNE"
D9bNctNnAig,What's better than datacamp that you'd recommend?
D9bNctNnAig,Really informative! 😁
D9bNctNnAig,How can I delete my account
D9bNctNnAig,10:16 where it starts with feedback
D9bNctNnAig,"I'm here because of one of your ""WHO IS THIS NOT FOR"" criteria. (Im an absolute beginner in Data Analytics and am not sure what I need to learn) Any idea what bootcamps or Career Programs I can take online to get started? Im currently looking into the GOOGLE Data Analytics Program"
D9bNctNnAig,"Data Camp, Udemy and what not are all garbage. It's scam. 
There's enough free content available and these ""courses"" are mostly completely worthless, just open any book or do a quick web search and you're off better than with whatever these garbage platforms offer. 
On top of that the ""certificates"" are totally worthless as well, it's just some good boy e-points nobody cares about. What kind of smoothbrain employer hires somebody based on some web course anyways?"
D9bNctNnAig,"Sir, will i be getting a certificate to add into my resume ?"
D9bNctNnAig,"Would someone recommend one or more of these courses for trading? The final aim being to create my own bot, thanks"
D9bNctNnAig,DataCamp is 100% useless. DO NOT USE IT!
D9bNctNnAig,Does datacamp offer free certificate once we complete the course
D9bNctNnAig,"Anyone interested in DataCamp, towards the end of the year they offer an annual subscription for $150."
D9bNctNnAig,"My biggest problem with Data Camp is that they just throw information and code at you. It's almost overkill. The fact that you get almost no practice writing the code yourself, makes it worse. The way they deliver course content is extremely repetitive and I honestly don't remember a lot after 8-10 months of using it. The best way to learn is to experiment yourself. And if you want to remain sane during your learning journey, just select one resource and stick to it."
D9bNctNnAig,What do you think is the best option to learn python from beginner to pro?
D9bNctNnAig,Coding with Mosh is awesome!!!
D9bNctNnAig,Hi Alex! Great video! I would like to know what is your opinion about DataCamp´s Data Scientist Track. Do you believe that it is suitable to pursue a Data Science career?
D9bNctNnAig,"Suppose one wants to do data analyst with python & one has zero knowledge in noth data science & Python programming, is this a good place to start?"
D9bNctNnAig,"I really love how you gives us honest feedbacks on these platforms. Because of that, you just got one additional subscriber. Keep it up!"
D9bNctNnAig,"Hey Alex, great review. Any advice on 365 Data science platform?"
D9bNctNnAig,Appreciate your great review and deep insight!
D9bNctNnAig,Pros and cons 10:13
D9bNctNnAig,"andrew ng, sentdex,jermy howard,mit course that's it you can do all most everthing with that"
D9bNctNnAig,"I have subscribed for second year for Datacamp and actually got the ""cheaper"" deal with approx. 12,5$ per month. I think this is a steal, even if it's just for syntax learning. But after one year, I think the best part is really the interactivity for me. Few videos, and then exercise and from scratch, so you are building on top of already learned skills. As you've said, probably best for beginners, not for advanced people. For me, it's great and for some time it still will be."
D9bNctNnAig,"Hi Alex, was wondering from coursera certificate which one do you think is best the google one or the IBM?"
D9bNctNnAig,So grateful for your content! I have just started looking at Data Analytics and was quite confused on which are the good ones!
D9bNctNnAig,"my university just provided me with 6 months datacamp plan, i guess it's the best time to become data analyst lol"
D9bNctNnAig,"You don't lose points by getting it wrong, just by asking for hints or giving up. That's actually quite clever and based gamification. Look for Mark Rober's talk on the Super Mario effect."
D9bNctNnAig,Is this a good platform to use for beginners? [No coding background]
VsztBAEtC7c,"Is this recommendation still valid, it is 2025 would the features still be similar to what it was in 2020"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Please should a total beginner to Python take the “Python for Data Science and Machine Learning” course? Does it cover all the important foundational concepts? I know Excel VBA. And I'm leaning towards data analytics.

Thanks!"
VsztBAEtC7c,IS it ok to take this course in 2024?
VsztBAEtC7c,Just nothing but Udemy ads....🤔
VsztBAEtC7c,This is an ad
VsztBAEtC7c,Is this course still ranked this high in 2023? Plus any free coupon code available?
VsztBAEtC7c,looks like a p3n1s
VsztBAEtC7c,"Question: after learning excel, SQL, PowerBi can I just take python first or python for data analytics, or focus on SQL"
VsztBAEtC7c,Had your opinion changed since this video?
VsztBAEtC7c,I signed up for a Udemy course and ended up having to get a refund because it was outdated
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hey
I am thinking of taking this course but it was last updated in 2020 but the content is really good. So, can you advise me if it would be wise to take this course?
Also, thank you for all your videos and the amazing content you put. They have been a great help to me!"
VsztBAEtC7c,"You should do a python series, Alex. I tried courses by Jose before and find him too technical- you explain things much better!"
VsztBAEtC7c,"hello, if dont  have any knowledge of python  i can still take this  course?"
VsztBAEtC7c,Hi Alex. I have a request! Would you make a video explaining why is necessary or advantageous to use Python for visualizations instead of using  Tableau or Power BI? In my opinion is much easier Power BI or Excel to do charts so there must be a clear advantage to use Python for particular reasons.
VsztBAEtC7c,Let's say that I'm Micheal Scott from the Office and I have absolutely no idea about python not even even basic's basic. Will it help me to learn it from the scratch as I've no computer science experience nor IT ex. I belong to management background and never had any exposure with any of the programming or coding languages ever.
VsztBAEtC7c,Hi Alex! Thanks for the video! Just noticed Portilla released a new course called '2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass' on Udemy. Which one would you take today? The one from 2020 or this brand new one?
VsztBAEtC7c,"Alex, I'm looking at getting either the Learning Python for Data Analysis or Learn Python for Data Science and Machine Learning. They look very similar but also different and I've seen you recommend both in the past. Is there one you recommend more for certain situations and would you say they're mostly pretty similar? Thank you"
VsztBAEtC7c,I took the python course on Codecademy and enjoyed it. However I still tend to struggle sometimes with some of the weird questions they ask u to solve. How fluent in python do I need to be in order to land a entry level job?
VsztBAEtC7c,Can i put these projects in my portfolio??
VsztBAEtC7c,I amzero at programming. should i start that course?
VsztBAEtC7c,Can you recommend the courses to take for someone completely new to data science
VsztBAEtC7c,"When you’re learning a new skill/language, do you have to do it on your own time (outside of work), or do you do it in the office, during work hours? If outside, how many hours per day/week do you roughly spend learning new skills? Great video as always man, thanks!!"
VsztBAEtC7c,Where do Matlab stands now days in comparaison with Python ?
VsztBAEtC7c,What do you think about Dataquest?
VsztBAEtC7c,"I'm a high school student and an absolute begineer to all of these, but I want to have a career in data science. Is this a good course to start that journey. I have no basics of phyton, coding, etc."
VsztBAEtC7c,this course is permanent or it has a limited time of use?
VsztBAEtC7c,I took R with Jose Portilla and he's really good.
VsztBAEtC7c,Jose Portilla: The God of teaching how to code. I just love his work ;)
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hey Alex, hope you doing fine and your family as well. Im trying to learn Tableau,but im looking for the best course for it. What is the best course ? And which one helped you the most?
Thanks"
VsztBAEtC7c,Any free courses you recommend?
VsztBAEtC7c,Sir I seen a course in python for data analyst in plurasight can you please make a review over that course . It's exactly for the data analyst only.
VsztBAEtC7c,You are the guy Alex! thanks man.
VsztBAEtC7c,Thank you for very good information
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hi Alex, firts thx for your videos! i love it!.

Question, i am a data analyst and i am learing python. it is better this one that you recommend on this video o the other ""Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization"", that you recommend in other video ""Best courses for data analyst"", both are in 12usd today i wanna buy one.

Thx!!"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Totally agree, Jose Portillo deserves a huge amount of credit for his courses. There are three tutors on Udemy that i have done the most courses - Jose, Kiril Ermenko and Ahmed Rafik (Web scraping). Jose's courses on Data Analysis(in Python & R) are outstanding, his delivary is so good. His NLP course in Python is also a great foundation. I couldnt aggree (and recommend) more!!!!"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hello Alex, hope your well. Can you pls do a video on day in the life of data analyst. Also, is it common for data analyst to work from home? That is what I do to be able to do eventually. Thanks!"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Congrats on the sponsor Alex, Hopefully the trend continues!"
VsztBAEtC7c,Worth a listen to. Thank you.
VsztBAEtC7c,"Well you are a youtuber now.

With a sponsor 👍"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hey Alex,

Thank you for the video. I have already finished this course and liked it a lot. I personally want to get into data science as a career which is why it was a great start for me. However, I feel I am still lacking very basic knowledge in Python and since it barely skimmed over it, I wasn't sure where to go next. Please recommend another Udemy or Youtube course which helps you master Python to a basic and intermediate level for Data Science. Thanks again."
VsztBAEtC7c,The like to dislike ratio speaks volumes on the importance of your video!
VsztBAEtC7c,Stupid Recommendation ! Everyone can understand very well that what contents will be provided and what material will be delivered in only rs. 455.
VsztBAEtC7c,"I'm working through my masters and a lot of these topics are in it. Thanks for the suggestion, will be buying!"
VsztBAEtC7c,Thank you so much! I've been looking for courses.
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hello Mr.Alex, Could you explain how you analyze data and conclude it into the insight for business, step by step please.  :)  
I'm being a first jobber as data analyst in a few days so your technique could help me and others certainly.

Thank you so much with Love from Thailand"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Just passing by to say that your channel has been an amazing inspiration to me. 

I am Brazilian and I have been studying data Analysis for a couple of months and I hope I can switch into a new career soon. However, I need to say I have never worked or done anything related to IT industry before and it’s been really hard for me to learn it, but I am quite sure I do it. 

Great job!!!!"
VsztBAEtC7c,"I have no idea what jupyter is but I saw summation and logirithmic regression and now I’m getting calculus flashbacks🥴😂, but I’m glad he’s got the sponsor from Udemy now to check his page and plan my year to learn data analytics skills lol"
VsztBAEtC7c,"I highly recommend Plotly, although it's not yet quite popular."
VsztBAEtC7c,"Thank you for this valuable info.. I have one question: How much math do we need to become data analyst?
Will appreciate your input.. 😀"
VsztBAEtC7c,"gotta hit em with that classic shock face thumbnail clickbait

10/10 would recommend same courses. I would add that having a lot of math under your belt is helpful too."
VsztBAEtC7c,Do you have a favourite SQL course?
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hi Alex,  Thanks for the insight on the course.
I was wondering how much programming experience you  should have to take this course?  I have a little bit, but it has been a long time.  My most recent stuff would be SQL queries and stored procedures as I am trying to head into the Data Analyst field from my Admin and BA background.
Thanks  :-)"
VsztBAEtC7c,Can you talk about OODBMS
VsztBAEtC7c,"Congratulations on the sponsor! Would you recommend this course if someone has already taken the IBM data science specialization ? That series of courses is very python heavy and also has its own course in machine learning

Would it make for good supplemental learning or just be doubling down on the same concepts?"
VsztBAEtC7c,please Make a video on data cleaning method in pandas  for data analyst .
VsztBAEtC7c,Does this course has certificate after completion?
VsztBAEtC7c,"Thanks for such a useful video! There are also a few freecodecamp courses on Python, Data Science, and SQL that are very useful."
VsztBAEtC7c,"Sir,What are Databases a data analyst need to know? I already learnt MySQL and PostgreSQL is it enough?"
VsztBAEtC7c,"Is this necessary for someone trying to land his first data analyst role? I'm focusing heavily on SQL and Tableau, plus I'm already great at Excel."
VsztBAEtC7c,"Hi Alex, I'm from South Africa. Should I go into software development or data analytics? Maybe you could do a video distinguishing between the two. Thank you"
VsztBAEtC7c,thank you so much for this recommendation sir.... really love the way you motivate and guide us :)
T3KMZoXrVTQ,If you live in Excel (like an accountant) Power Query can do most of the things you would need Python for.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Super useful deserves super like
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Great video. SQL is a MUST!
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Im an Excel power user. I get to be so creative in Excel that my spreadsheets are scary! Lol. There is no spreadsheet i can't develop. The companies I've worked for often give me the most powerful laptop on market to work with their data. I am self-taught. I learned Excel shortly after Windows made its debut. Yep...I was 19 years old. At my current age, i am even more keen on spreadsheet acrobatics...i can't get enough! Going to go ahead and get serious about SQL and Python so i can be self-employed before retirement age. By the time i retire, I'd like to have a firm of data consultants for businesses that don't have the budget to have its own data experts."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I've gone from basic html to Advanced Excel to learning R,  Tableau and SQL (SSMS and SQLite). Currently exploring Python, Power BI, MongoDB and Hadoop. But there are so many tools and software out there to learn that sometimes it feels overwhelming even as a data analyst. Also no one organization uses the same tool so targeting your dream company and learning what they use can be a great challenge"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hi alex here's my question. Do you think having the said skills (-experience) you're already employable into data analyst world?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I currently work in finance as an analyst using only base excel. I decided to take a Data Analytics bootcamp from Fullstack Academy this way I can learn SQL, more advanced Excel, Python, Tableu and AWS. The way the market is going, these are fundamental skills. IMO, they should be taught as a final year course in college. They’ve become so necessary."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Data analyst don't use python, in Real World"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex.

I was wondering if you'd be able to make a tutorial/overview on how to use Python/R in a cloud platform sometime in the future. I really appreciate your content; it's incredibly helpful."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Can Python do everything Excel can do ?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex, can you tell me how important a statistics background is to becoming a data analyst.  I loved my intro to stats class in college, should I brush up on it?  Would it help me become a more functional member of a data science/analyst team, do you think?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hey alex.love u😍🤩
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex, I'll be studying Business Analytics(more data-oriented) and Project Management-IT. Can I work as a business analyst(non-technical role) upon completion of these courses as I'll have knowledge of data and management? [skills taught are: SAS, SQL, and visualization tools in 1st one]"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,what about maths?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"When you say Excel, is that specifically Microsoft software not an alternative like Google Sheets?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Firstly, thank you for the information which is really helpful. Quick question that to work as Data Analyst as you mentioned 5 skills are sufficient or have to know Machine Learning algorithms as well?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Alex,  the last two links in the description don't work anymore, what were the courses called?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey, is it necessary to learn Tableau or Bi, if I already know how to use python for data visualization??

I hope many people have the same question and it would be good if you could give an answer to us."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,How much math skills do you need as a data analyst?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Your contact is always so on point.   I want to thank you so much for your time and expertise.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,4 down one to go.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Thank you!
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hello Alex, hope you are doing really good, hey do you have any recomendation about excel course for data analyst? thanks in advance"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Which books would you recommend for someone just getting into Data Analysis?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey Alex,
Nice informative video.
Can you let me know what is best for visualization Tableau or Python with libraries?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hi Alex! Love your videos! Was curious: do you still use Reddit? Earlier last year you and I were talking a bit and you gave me some great advice. I sent you a message but looking at your feed - doesnt look like you have been on in quite some time :)
T3KMZoXrVTQ,R is forgotten. Sad
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey Alex, hope your well. I am currently an undergrad HEALTH information management student and will graduate in a couple of months. Interested in become a healthcare data analyst. I know I have to lear SQL, r studio, python and sort but do I need to know a lot of math? No very good at that. Thank you!"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I like to use Python to automate any long or repetitive processes at work at I can do the same in Python.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex,
I’m currently trying to teach myself the skills needed to confidently apply to dba positions. Without a degree (associates in general education), so for me to stand out among other applicants I understand I’d have to create a portfolio to actually prove I know what I know. But what sort of projects would you do with pretty much only MySQL knowledge and tableau?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Do you think that you should have some sort of ""special talent"" to learn all those programming languages? Or can anyone learn them?  Because I'm really interested in the topic and I'd like to study it but I'm afraid it could be too hard 🥺"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Great video! It’s encouraging since I have most of that under my belt already, at least on a beginner level. It gives me a great list of things focus on as I continue to educate myself. 

By the way, I’m still waiting for you to explain why you posted those “This is better than that” posts on LinkedIn. Those were also fun! And you promised an explanation. **foot tapping impatiently**

Anyway, I’m a big fan! Can’t wait for your next video. Thanks!"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I find myself delivering large data sets in  Microsoft Access or CSV files to financial teams that don't use SQL, Power BI or SSRS."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"So skill 5 is not actually a skill: as explained, you’ll have to learn several different skills to exploit the possibilitrs in a cloud platform. By the way, Excel can do most data worm, once you learn the Power Query."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hi Alex i'm starting my páth to become a data analyst. I'm looking for books or Courses specificali to learn about theory or Best práctices of data analysis. I'm pretty good at SQL and practicing a lot of python.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex,

As usual a great video. I was wondering if I could request a video where you can show us how to create a portfolio regarding the data analyst course. As I have mentioned in one of your previous videos that I am currently doing a bunch of courses with Pythos, Tableau, and SQL, where I have to lots of practices. I wish there was a way for me to showcase those skills as a portfolio to make up for my lack of experience in this job field."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Many think data analysis and data science will be automated soon. This might be true but I think AI cannot replace data analysts because we still need someone who clean dirty data. To be honest, what’s  your opinion this?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Can you please suggest some good courses for tableau?
I am a beginner to get on this path"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I work extensively with SQL, Excel, and Tableau at work. I really enjoy working with data, but management seems to underestimate the work involved in analyzing data. It seems like I'm valued less than everyone else. I'm just the guy that ""builds reports"".  I hear this is pretty common... Any other analysts here struggle with this?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,You don't need to write too much sql. Tools like MS SQL Server or MySQL have visual query builders which will write sql for you. For more complex analysis you can always export your query to excel or PowerBI.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex, very good video and it motives me a lot. I think you could add that the data analyst need held some pressure because he use to work with a lot of people and sometimes directly with big boss. I think the job is not just hard skills as Python, SQL etc, It's as well how to manage people, organize his work  etc"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hello I have studied Statistics and I'm trying to bulid my cv as data analyst learning new skills like Python SQL exc. Thank you for sharing all this valuable info with us! I just wanted to ask you if you also have any recommendation from udemy for learning POWER BI? Thank you!
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hello Alex, I will graduate end of this year, I am studying SQL, python and tableau. Can you talk about how to find a job and where we can find an internship? And I really want to know what is the SQL, python minimum level to get a job?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Question for Alex or anyone in the comments who knows: Do we expect the Google Coursera data analyst certificate to be included in Coursera Plus?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,This is a great video! I'm learning Python now as I want to be a data scientist from a data analyst
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Alex can you please tell me that what methods we are using for data cleaning in pandas? Suggest me the YouTube video regarding this .
T3KMZoXrVTQ,This video is right on point👏
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I am so used to Python already , that lazy to use Excel again. Some more can do machine learning"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Could you elucidate more on the cloud platform skill? And could you tell any online course or book to kick off for cloud platform ..keeping in mind the other 4 skills I have some exposure with. Thanks.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Any Azure tutorials that you recommend?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I achieved SQL badge on LinkedIn last time as well as Excell. I'm on a Data analysis in SQL track on DataCamp and it's really good, actually I'm actually on times series analysis course. I have basic knowledge of python (OOP, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib) I've started learning VBA and looking forward for first Junior Data Analyst job. I noticed that need to make a some kind of project on GIt to prove my abilities. What you recommend to do it? Thanks for all your videos!"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Hey Alex! I’m just starting out...I’m trying to make a switch on my career path. Do I start with some free courses or should I just dive directly into taking the courses you mentioned on udemy? Which is best?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex! Awesome video as always. Definitely agree with you on Python and SQL. I'm exploring their uses in data visualization and storage with AWS free tier and Microsoft Power BI, its crazy how flexible and powerful they are!"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"This was very helpful !! Thankyou .
One question : can you suggest me which cloud platform should I learn if i have done the first 4 skills ? GCP/Azure/AWS ?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Please make a detailed video of how to make SQL reports in Excel. :)
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Really like the short informative videos like these Alex. Would appreciate it if you can make more shorter videos than the long 30 mins ones. 
Love your content! Thank You!!"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Thank you so much Alex for this VALUABLE Information!!
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey Alex, perfect timing on this video! I do remember the first video on this topic. I am looking into learning SQL, Phython, and Tableau. Looking for some advise on how to go about learning all 3 without feeling overwhelmed. How was your process? Or any recommendations on how I should proceed?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey Alex, Great video thanks a lot! Part of my job is to collect data from all those different partners to prepare daily reports for performance analysis (DW/BI) . Each of them has different dashboards which you need to login first, different structure and different steps to retrieve the data (it's mainly in xslx or csv format). More importantly you can only download it via browser. So my question is which tool can help me to collect all these data automatically? Can python help me with automating this process and have a uniform structure before adding to excel/power bi?

Final note, I would love to see a video frok you explaining APIs"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex, firstly I'd like to express my gratitude for sharing your knowledge and  helping others in your channel. Then with the vast range of online resources, what is you evaluation for 365  DS platform? Is it worth the cost?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Yes. Totally agree with all the tools and programming languages you mentioned.  Cloud computing is becoming equally important for data analysts these days and will become a must skill to have for data analysts.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I am learning Excel and python most nowdays. This video motivate me alot.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Alex, please make a separate video for Cloud platform in Data Analytics."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I remember going going from learning Excel to Tableau to SQL and now Python.  Biggest change honestly (so far) was Excel to SQL for handling data.  Holy! I thought I was a boss with Power Query and then SQL said hold my semi-colon.
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Awesome
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex! Great video as always.

I am curios to know which IDE do use for data analysis in python.

I personally find jupyter notebook to be great for this but maybe you prefer to use other IDEs on your job.

Thanks."
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"SELECT Alex_the_analyst FROM Youtube_channel WHERE name is = Top_5_skills 

😄"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,I am still learning SQL. It's fun to learn. And it gets complicated the deeper one goes
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey Analyst ;),  as you said those sequence of points are correct,  Now I'm jumping to Azure don't know which services useful, but I learning ADF, any other suggestions?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Your videos are awesome as always! Keep up the good work and the positivity in the video!
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hi Alex,
Do I require to have knowledge of both  Tableau and PowerBI? 
I am working on Tableau and I also completed some tableau certification but I don't have knowledge about PowerBI . 
Please advise"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"1.  SQL 
2. Excel
3. Tableau/ PowerBI
4. Python
5. Cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Great update ! Love that you explain the WHY of these tools
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Alex which country are you living ?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"If I have to pick between Tableau/Power BI, which one should I go for?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,For data analyst we have to learn python library or not . Please reply
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I'm working on python right now, programming is my biggest weakness, i'm improving it"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,How do u recommend learning cloud platforms? Not sure if it’s in the course video you have
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I think you should consider R, if you are going to learn selective packages in R then the learning curve is not that much. Also, the Rmarkdown is a fabulous notebook which lets you write R,Python,SQL,bash all under one roof. You should give it a try!!"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey, so I have recently started learning how to use the pandas module of Python, and was just wondering what the main use for it usually is. At the moment, I spend most of my time just being able to deal with most typical user requests using power query and connecting to SQL databases in order to create refreshable spreadsheets or Power BI reports. So yeah, what things would I typically find myself doing in Python that would be unreasonable for Power Query / Excel / Power BI?

The main things I know of are machine learning, NLP and some statistical functions, but I just want to know some more other practical use cases of Python (hope that makes sense)"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,Thank you for your valuable information Sir...👍👍
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"If you love SQL so much why don't you marry it?



Jk great info as per"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,What about R Programming language ?
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I would recommend Qlik Sense as well. Very powerful, easy to learn. Available as SaaS & on Prem"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"Hey ! 
Can you suggest any good source or something to learn how to use tableau ?"
T3KMZoXrVTQ,"I'm joining with you in this journey ❤️
Love from India❤️"
tJaDicmRW7s,onions!
tJaDicmRW7s,Do the 2023/2024 version of this
tJaDicmRW7s,🧅
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions… love your channel!
tJaDicmRW7s,And what about the telecommunication industry for data scientists?
tJaDicmRW7s,"I know I’m commenting on this a year later but you were wrong about the travel industry specifically regarding short term rentals like Airbnb and VRBO. What happened in regards to travel was people were flying less which means destination vacations like Hawaii or flying across the country were showing a major slow down. Instead, people started looking for great areas that they could drive to and at a reasonable distance. Drive to destinations like The Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, Destin Florida, and Miramar beach and Joshua Tree absolutely exploded. Owners of rentals were seeing the highest rates they’ve ever been able to charge because people just wanted to get away and a lot of the travelers were using their COVID checks to pay for these vacations. That and the increase in remote work allowed people to work and also visit a place they’ve never been to before. Just an observation and as always I love the content and you have inspired me to change my career trajectory to Data Analytics. Once I get a job I’ll donate 1/4 of my first paycheck to you as a massive thank you for the free content you have provided!"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Any updates for 2022?  I feel like Agriculture and transportation fit into global supply chain issues, which seems very important right now.  Especially with the geopolitical climate and a fertilizer shortage."
tJaDicmRW7s,surprisingly.... there is no mention of supply chain industry
tJaDicmRW7s,I’m assuming the insurance industry falls in the finance heading since insurance is essentially a financial product?
tJaDicmRW7s,WES Analysis takes how many days? I'm from India and Planning to Apply for MS in Data Analytics at San Jose State University in CA for Jan 2023 Intake.
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions🍴🍴
tJaDicmRW7s,"Analyzing statistics in a dataset is like slowly peeling back layers of an onion, if you think about it. The more layers of the proverbial onion that you peel back (i.e. the deeper you dive into the data and differentiate between correlation and causation), the closer you get to understanding the key factors that drive certain trends in the industry you are analyzing."
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hey Alex, can you prepare a 2022 version of Best Companies for Data Analysts?"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Mm Onions 
<3"
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions! And do you have an updated or new video on this topic for 2022? I work in education and am looking to get into DA within education. Do you find it to be a ripe industry for data analysts?
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions! Lol
tJaDicmRW7s,I made it to the end and I support your channel on a monthly basis. I must be a Patreonion! Here is an idea: choose each of those industries you spoke of and come up with project ideas that someone trying to break into data analytics could do and add to their portfolio. Prison Mike.
tJaDicmRW7s,The onion of life :)
tJaDicmRW7s,I enjoy watching your videos. In what industry do you work at as a data analyst? I am just curious.   Onions are good for your health.
tJaDicmRW7s,So people mean less to you when they dont have enough money to support your channel.? Hmmmm☹ Onions
tJaDicmRW7s,"hi alex, love the channel , could you make a video on "" how to land an entry level data analyst job in 2021"" for someone just starting their career ."
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions..... ATA rocks
tJaDicmRW7s,What are your thoughts about Consumer Goods Industry?
tJaDicmRW7s,I hope this ONION makes you smile as you peel through your day.
tJaDicmRW7s,"So if 2021 is going to be the onion of life, does that mean that we're going to cry even more in 2021 than in 2020?"
tJaDicmRW7s,Just onion rings 🤣🙌🏽
tJaDicmRW7s,"Onions. Thank you for what you do, it's motivating. I used to be a Market Analyst (now known as a Data Analyst) 2000 to 2010, and performed some paid consulting and pro bono work a few years back. Am now getting back to working on my skills to get back to perform full-time via consulting, contract work, or possibly with an employer."
tJaDicmRW7s,"Im a beginner, one day im become a Data Analyst 🙂"
tJaDicmRW7s,Please make a vedio about most helpful courses as a beginner
tJaDicmRW7s,"Alex I've been trying to find out about  data analyst salalries/roles in consulting or entertianment ( such as disney).  I'll keep digging on YT.
     I know  consultants at the big4/big 3 make alot but idk how much data roles make at these firms."
tJaDicmRW7s,"thank you, this is insightful since I am searching for internship placement right now"
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions!
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions... I use them all the time in my cooking.  :)
tJaDicmRW7s,What are the things we Should learn in ms excel to become a data analyst ?  Please reply .
tJaDicmRW7s,what about telecom industry
tJaDicmRW7s,"Thanks for the video, the top and most of the middle tier industries didn't surprise me too much. I am enrolled in a bootcamp, finishing next Friday. If you have any interest in a Q&A from someone who lived through it I can both validate certain assumptions that exist while also disproving others. There wasn't a lot of information I found on which bootcamp would be worth my time which for me is a big red flag. I can see value in removing the bias curtain a bit to give yourself and others the chance to better understand why they're both good and bad for the DA industry."
tJaDicmRW7s,"Just curious, what do you think of the Energy Industry? I can see it fitting into the situation of Big Tech and Construction, but not really sure. I think most energy companies have done fine since it’s an essential type business."
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hi Alex,
My suggestion: what are the different software tools needed in industries where Data Analyst are employed. You spoke about healthcare, banking, finance and more. However, there different opinions online abs has become frustrating. Also, will the soft skills be transferable across all fields? Thank you 😊 🧅 🧅"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Onions yo!! Especially love it grilled in a burger 🍔 
Thanks for this relevant video,gives me a better idea of what industries I should at during my job search! 👍"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hi Alex, love the content! May I ask what gear you use for filming and audio recording? Thanks & greetings from Germany! Viktor"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hey Alex 

I currently have 60-90 credits from a bachelor's of arts in business from a state University. I haven't completed a degree and currently have 5 years of experience working IT on government contracts.

Is it recommended that I finish my degree in something on the business side such as finance, learn SQL/python/stats and try to land a BI role?

Or should I go ahead and pursue a science degree such as a bachelor's of science in CS? 

Goal is BI/DA --> MLE/DS one day"
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions and also thank you Alex for all that guidance
tJaDicmRW7s,"Alex, from what I know of Real Estate, Analysts tend to be Financial Analysts."
tJaDicmRW7s,"I feel extremely lucky to have your content, especially while I am completing my BS in applied mathematics and statistics and about to take a data analytics course.  What can I do to best prepare myself and stand out as a candidate when I graduate, other than learning SQL, Python, and Tableau?"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hi! Thank you for your great advices! Mr Alex, What kind of projects do you recommend creating and having in a Data Analyst's portfolio?"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Onions are tasy too If cooked properly. Wannabe Data Analyst here, trying to get into the field"
tJaDicmRW7s,He Alex I would like to know your  opinion about Agriculture industry.
tJaDicmRW7s,"Where would biotech, pharma, and medical device land?"
tJaDicmRW7s,Can you please make a video on where to create projects please and thank you sir 🙏 also not sure where to join patreon(jk I found the link)
tJaDicmRW7s,Thank you for this video ❣️
tJaDicmRW7s,You didn’t mention education.
tJaDicmRW7s,I’m surprised Supply Chain/Logistics/Freight didn’t make it to the top tier. Lots of innovation and transformation happening in the space.
tJaDicmRW7s,"Onions are super underrated. All soups, burgers, stir fry, and casseroles should have them"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Onions, peeling back the layers of life"
tJaDicmRW7s,"I'm just finding out about Patreon, I'm from Nigeria 😁...can I use it though?"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Yess! Onions... I feel the same way too, cool metaphor for 2021"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hey, I would have to check you haven't talked about this, but maybe a video addressing work-life balance and burnout e.g. remote work, family, stress etc."
tJaDicmRW7s,Vege squad woop woop: Onions
tJaDicmRW7s,"I don't like onions in food, but I like the metaphor of peeling back layers in life. I have a lot of goals for 2021 and beyond, first of which being to complete my BS in Business Analysis and to secure a remote job as a data analyst."
tJaDicmRW7s,"I am trying to switch careers from a insurance to a data analyst and was wondering some ways I can make myself look better for getting a job. Just looking for an entry level job but not sure if I need to try and learn skills like python, SQL, ect. or do you have any tips to help? I've watched most of your videos but it is hard to know where to start. Thank you so much for all of the content!! Also Onions"
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions! A suggestion I had was that maybe you could do like virtual interviews with other data analysts (maybe in similar or different industries) just so that we can see the different types of experiences that data analysts have!
tJaDicmRW7s,"Thanks for this video, Alex! What do you think about Healthcare and Insurance industries?"
tJaDicmRW7s,You know what else has layers? Cake. Everybody loves cake
tJaDicmRW7s,Are you in any podcast platforms? I feel like you voice and content will be perfect for podcast!!
tJaDicmRW7s,🧅
tJaDicmRW7s,Hey alex I have been working as a BI developer for almost 7 yrs. Planning to migrate Ireland for data analyst course... Do you think this is this best course of action and what kind of jobs will I get. Already tableau certified
tJaDicmRW7s,"I think a good video would be how to turn a human question into a specific question for your analysis and how break big analysis problems into smaller steps and think computationally...may be a little heady but I think walking through that process with someone who is experienced would be super helpful...

Or a video on how you think about how you decide on a visualization and what to include in it , or how you prepare a presentation... As I've been working with tableau the amount of choices can be overwhelming

 Also maybe a mock data analyst interview video lol where it feels like I'm on video call being interviewed so I can practice answering questions"
tJaDicmRW7s,🧅🧅🧅🧅🧅🧅
tJaDicmRW7s,"From my search there are a lot of positions an real estate for analyst.. three job titles I've found and my understanding of them so far  are: ""Real estate analyst"" (don't know why it's a seperate title) , ""Aquisitions analyst"" (should we buy this) and ""asset management analyst"" (how are our properties doing)
It's a lot of running the numbers on a property to see if it makes sense as an investment, and on properties already in the company's portfolio to asses how they are performing.

Your linkedin video was amazing but how would you implement an Industry criteria in your research ? Also as someone who knows the healthcare industry is remote working comfortable ?

tJaDicmRW7s,Onions... happy new year Alex
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions.😁
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hi Alex, 
Just a quick question. I am a CA (equivalent of US-CPA) from India.
How a finance professional should approach data science and data analyst. Would love to know areas of  employment for Finance professional in DS.
Thanks"
tJaDicmRW7s,"Hey Alex, I would like to know your opinions about sports industry especially, team sports. Is there a bright future there?"
tJaDicmRW7s,what about logistic service? Is it good?
tJaDicmRW7s,Onions. I am just a student right now so cant join your patreon group. I am also very excited for 2021.
tJaDicmRW7s,"Great video, Alex! But seriously, the onion search engine is the only search engine that i wont try."
hfRcaRw_atI,"Another tip I would include is: Confidence comes with experience. While there will always some level of anxiety related to doing a job interview, you'll find its greatly reduced if you have experience in the domain, tools, and technology associated with the role. This doesn't have to be exclusively work experience. It can be hours of SQL practice or several projects using Python. Employers are looking for people that can help them get work done. And if you have a lot of work you got done, you can come in with confidence that you will be someone of value to the company. Do not neglect this part. Get in the practice on tools and tech you will use, finish projects in the domain and industry you want to work in, and shamelessly post about it somewhere! Build confidence."
hfRcaRw_atI,❤❤❤❤
hfRcaRw_atI,"Quite generic insights, nothing specific and no example/ sample answers given"
hfRcaRw_atI,thx man!
hfRcaRw_atI,Thank you Alex! Your insight really  helps me!
hfRcaRw_atI,
hfRcaRw_atI,"my timestamp
0:35 - story for leader, work in tem, over problem
1:25 - do research for company
1:50 -  technical ready (sql python) 
2:30 - study websites
3:05 - there are many questions"
hfRcaRw_atI,"It doesn't matter how casual the potential work place is nor workplace for which you're applying. Always dress a step up for your interview. If you think they wear jeans and tshirts, go business casual. If research shows a business casual environment, buy a suit."
hfRcaRw_atI,"For people who speak English as a second language, its common to stop for a second and think of the right word. Does that throw the interviewer off?"
hfRcaRw_atI,"Very helpful, thanks a lot!!!"
hfRcaRw_atI,"I have an interview tomorrow for a data analyst position. I am confident in my technical answers, but what will kill me is my nervousness."
hfRcaRw_atI,Alexxxxxx
hfRcaRw_atI,"Lying during an interview starts with the lies on your resume/cover letter.

Some interviewers can be funny, they'll leave questions on data analysis and ask you questions about the company."
hfRcaRw_atI,Do we need to know about DSA for Data Analyst / Data Scientist Job
hfRcaRw_atI,"Hi Alex, I have my interview this Monday. This is my first data analyst interview. I am freaking out. I have watched all of your videos on SQL, Tableau, Excel and made projects alongside. I have practiced a lot but I don't feel confident. I feel like I'm forgetting everything I studied. What should I do? 
Thanks for the tips btw"
hfRcaRw_atI,"0:39 Not coming up with Examples and stories (e.g leadership)
1:22 Not Researching about the company
1:47 Not preparing for the technical questions (Most likely SQL, sometimes Python)
2:35 Not asking questions during/after the interview
3:44 Not telling the truth in your interview
4:24 Not dressing professional in an interview"
hfRcaRw_atI,"last one is a good one, shirt always mandatory altho interviewers tend to wear pijamas if they work from home"
hfRcaRw_atI,My favorite video yet! Made all these mistakes myself 😂
hfRcaRw_atI,Got a phone screen tomorrow for a jr data analyst position lol hopefully it goes well
hfRcaRw_atI,"You are the best,  Thank you for short and sweet video's,  excellent information"
hfRcaRw_atI,"Hey Alex, you said it was going to be a link for interview questions, but I don’t see any."
hfRcaRw_atI,"I got asked a lot of questions on leadership, working in a group/team, conflict resolution, and making mistakes (or major failures) during almost all of my interviews. Thankfully, I could think on my feet and come up with an answer almost immediately! But I'll definitely prepare for such questions from now on.

Just to add on, maybe one more point could be to know your resume in and out. The last thing you'd want is the interviewer to ask ""So why don't you tell me about xyz thing that you've written on your resume"", and you've completely forgotten about that project (or whatever the interviewer is asking for) and end up giving some vague answer. It just leaves a bad impression."
hfRcaRw_atI,"I mean... I could dress professionally... But I'm 400lbs... Doesn't matter how nice the clothes are, they won't look nice on my beanbag chair body... Lol"
hfRcaRw_atI,"Thank you! Please continue🙏, that was an amazing opportunity to learn from you."
hfRcaRw_atI,Thanks for the technical questions links.
hfRcaRw_atI,Do you know where we can find a list of commonly asked SQL questions?
hfRcaRw_atI,"Love your videos man, I'm excited to study this at uni soon"
hfRcaRw_atI,"Hey! I just found your channel and subscribed, love what you're doing! 

I like how clear and detailed your explanations are as well as the depth of knowledge you have surrounding the topic! Since I run a tech education channel as well, I love to see fellow Content Creators sharing, educating, and inspiring a large global audience. I wish you the best of luck on your YouTube Journey, can't wait to see you succeed! Your content really stands out and you've put so much thought into your videos! 



Cheers, happy holidays, and keep up the great work :)"
hfRcaRw_atI,Thanks Alex!
hfRcaRw_atI,"When it comes to the technical questions, you may also want to be familiar with self-joins. I've heard that having to know what a self-join is or even maybe even having to do a self-join as a coding challenge with SQL during an interview is common."
hfRcaRw_atI,"I want to become a healthcare data analyst. I am graduating with a BS in Heath information management. I also want to continue my education, should I finish my AS in Business Administration and go for a BS Business Administration or go for a MS in healthcare informatics. ? Are they unnecessary?"
hfRcaRw_atI,"For somebody who wants to become an analyst, should they learn Python or SQL or both? Is one language enough?"
hfRcaRw_atI,"Select mistakes
From interviews
Where name = ""Alex the Analyst"""
hfRcaRw_atI,Could you please make a video about how to find a remote junior data analyst job
hfRcaRw_atI,"What has worked really well for me in the past is asking about the background of the interviewer. It seems like a weird question, but it can be a really nice change of pace for a recruiter and it can be very helpful information if a potential future colleague is interviewing you! One time a recruiter went off on a full tangent and afterwards said they enjoyed a lovely conversation; what followed was him constantly going the extra mile for me and landing a pretty awesome position in 3 weeks or so"
hfRcaRw_atI,Do the recruiters expect us to write complex sub queries for entry level data analyst job roles
hfRcaRw_atI,How much SQL do you believe is required for an entry-level position?
hfRcaRw_atI,"one of my rules for life: ""Tell the truth — or, at least, don’t lie""  Jordan Peterson."
hfRcaRw_atI,How formal should the dress be? I mean very often I just see some interviewers so dressed up that they look a hitman or a con.
hfRcaRw_atI,"Yeah, that's one mistake I made. I was asked the difference between ""WHERE"" and ""HAVING"" and to describe the different types of JOINs, I failed that one. Hadn't practiced SQL beforehand."
hfRcaRw_atI,It was very helpful video. But I to get a job or internship ship as an entry level. Because I'm about to finish my bachelor and I'm still looking for this. And I'm from India and there different scenarios of interview and other stuff.
hfRcaRw_atI,"Good morning Alex, Thanks for sharing top data analyst interview mistakes to us."
hfRcaRw_atI,"Hi Alex,
You always  amaze me when you upload right video at the right time...i am in pursuit of getting a new job .....and here surprising  me with relevant  video....thank you very much ......."

w25ZjL0OqT4,"Most recruiters don't even scan your resume. Applicant Tracking Systems do. And 80% of the time, it rejects your resume."
w25ZjL0OqT4,pls what are the chances of remote working for data analysts?
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach! Very practical advise.
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach
w25ZjL0OqT4,"On the skill section, I used a table."
w25ZjL0OqT4,spinach
w25ZjL0OqT4,I love the intro. Great video. Thanks lots
w25ZjL0OqT4,Great video and insightful. I don't have a college degree (at least not yet) but I'm quite ready for a data analyst job because I self taught over the years and interned at a local company. Is my lack of a college degree a limitation to me getting a real job?
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach!! A much needed video I was looking forward to. Thanks for the meaningful tips @Alex 

I just have a question @Alex, what did you mean by Discord? Is that a website where we can put our resumes for review? Do let me know. Thanks again for all the info you have put out here. Your channel is my go-to place for learning everything about Data Analytics"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hi Alex, thank you for all the videos here. I have a question related to resume: How would my resume looks attractive to an employer if I have no experience related to Data analyst and shouldn't I give more importance to the personal project section in resume, as I made projects just to show employer that I did some work or practical experience related to the job applying for? Please advise..."
w25ZjL0OqT4,What is the discord link?
w25ZjL0OqT4,Hi Alex! I've been building resume with your guidance. It's really helpful. But I've certification with google data analytics which has R programming so for the skills section what do i add more with R
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach!! I currently am an Aircraft mechanic in the Air Force. I love the fact you emphasized that I would need to add things like tracking training in excel or creating daily presentations to deliver to leadership to show data analytics experience. Not sure if this will work but it make sense.
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach! LMAO I know I’m a year late, but just discovered your channel, and it has been so insightful!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinachhhh!! Alex, you are a blessing. This was very helpful and I am currently looking to transition into data analytics career so I will definitely use your tips and recommendations. Appreciate it boss man!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"I love Popeye and spinach! I have my resume, it's a lot like you described. I have not started applying yet. I am changing careers and in don't have experience as a data analyst,  I wonder if you recommend getting a portfolio in tableau with a few projects before starting to applying to jobs in Data."
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach!! Been applying for jobs for over 6 months now, currently reviewing my Resume and getting back out there. WML."
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hey Alex, is it okay if I add my internship experiences in my resume experience section"
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach
w25ZjL0OqT4,Alex! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Awesome stuff as always Alex! 
Quick question: were the Santa Claus glasses prescription glasses or just cosmetic? :P"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Thanks for the tips, specially the skills section really makes a huge difference getting into the details for each individual technology. I just updated my resume following your advice!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,You look cute in Santa's hat but without his beard.
w25ZjL0OqT4,I don't care what's the video about. I love the way you started the video😅
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Your videos are the spinach to our brains!! Alex, it's incredible the motivation you show and what it does to an analyst like me with a few  years of experience under the belt ;)"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"I had a lot of exposure to developing financial and sales spreadsheets in 2001 to 2005 (2 different jobs). Recently, I've taken refreshers and statistics for Excel. My last job ended in December 2021 was substitute teacher. Yeah I know.. 😐 since my deep experience with Excel was so long ago, do you recommend putting that job on my resume? I've had a lot of lousy jobs in between. I'm taking the Google Data Analyst Certificate program. I'm also taking some extra classes geared towards a data analyst profession."
w25ZjL0OqT4,Loved the santa outfit and hat! What a fun way to bring in the holiday season!
w25ZjL0OqT4,Eating all the “spinach”!  Getting close to completing my data science bootcamp at the end of the month. Looking forward to continuing my learning and landing my first job in a data role.
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach. I watched popeye as a kid growing up in Nigeria and I thought I would hate spinach. Then my family moved to the UK when I was a teenager and my mum started using spinach to make a popular Yoruba (Nigerian South Western tribe) dish called Efo Riro. Now, I use Spinach in smoothies, omolettes and Efo Riro. Thanks for sharing valuable content."
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach😀
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach!! Thank you so much, Alex."
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Showed your daughter shows from the 70’s/80’s! That’s a sign of a great father lmao! Great video, glad I found your channel. Working to catch up on watching them."
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach
w25ZjL0OqT4,"I am glad that I was on the right path with my resume, yet another teacher here looking to switch careers. Thank you for the amazing videos."
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach!!
Just discovered your channel by 12am this morning.. been through jalapenos, mushroom and now spinach, all in one night! Can't seem to get enough of how cool, educative  and relatable your contents are. Thanks for all you do! Those of us planning on switching careers are the better for it, pls don't stop"
w25ZjL0OqT4,SPINACH!
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Alex, thanks so much for your time and for all this great information!   I would like to move from a CPA firm specializing in tax to a data / financial analyst role.   I actually own the tax firm, just looking for a full-time role without the stress of doing a years worth of work in a few months.  I’m just north of 50 and not even sure anyone in your field would give me a second look.  I’d be happy to pay for your advice in updating my resume.   Do you have any interest?   Thanks in advance for any guidance or help."
w25ZjL0OqT4,It seems like you are just reading a book on How to Write a good resume. I doubt you can not write a good resume for yourself!
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hi Alex, Could you clarify what you meant about 4-5 in the Work Experience section? Do you mean we shouldn't include more than 4-5 job titles or do you mean we shouldn't add more than 4-5 descriptions per job title? Thanks so much! This was majorly helpful!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,Great tips! Thank you for this video. Were you perhaps slightly drunk in this video? Or is it  because I watched it on normal speed?
w25ZjL0OqT4,Spinach is delicious!
w25ZjL0OqT4,What would you include for a career changer thats going back to work after having been off for some time ?
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach, the blood work of Data Analytics."
w25ZjL0OqT4,Alex one resume review please! try spinach and cottage cheese curry(Palak Paneer)
w25ZjL0OqT4,whats the discord link
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hi Alex, I usually see your videos and understand about data analyst. I was java developer and worked for 10years.but now  it's six years that I left my  job and started doing panada and python Udemy courses.
It is ok to do nano degree for data analyst
Actually I wants to be hands on and get  experience of real working. Can you please suggest on this? About course and projects 🙏"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hey Alex, I'm doing an IBM data analyst professional certificate.
Is this certificate help me to get into an entry-level data analyst job?"
w25ZjL0OqT4,What could be an example of projects for cv for entry level Data Analyst positions?
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hi Alex, I have a question. I’m definitely making the switch from healthcare to an IT career this year and wanted to use Data Analysis as an entry. Would you advise against taking a DA diploma as opposed to being self taught instead? What are the pros and cons of both? I plan on getting a masters in the field later on in order to solidify my position in it so maybe the prerequisites I take in the diploma would aid my future application as opposed to being self taught.
What do you think?
LOVE your videos, keep it up!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach.. It's funny coz I love water spinach (aka ""kangkong"" in the Philippines) but I just found out as I'm typing this comment that despite the name water spinach, it's not really spinach nor related to it hahaha..Thanks for these tips!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,I have 2 year degree in BA + data analytics certification what are my chances landing a job?. Plan was to get a job then finish my 4 year degree
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Also, how can I send you my resume?"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hey Alex, do you think you will be able to try and get some of your followers who actually landed (entry level data roles) on your show whether it be a video interview or even just messages explaining what they done to get these jobs on top of your advice? I think it would be very informative! 
As always, love the videos!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach!! Thanks for answering my question on here Alex, I feel famous now, lol!! Hopefully you enjoyed your Christmas!
I might sent my resume to you to review. Thanks for doing that along with your very informative channel for this aspiring Data Analyst!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hello Alex, if you have not already, and when you have time, can you make a video reviewing college majors like statistics and math and your thoughts on how well they can prepare someone for a data analyst career?"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hi Alex, I have just discovered your channel and watched almost all your videos. You're doing fantastic job helping those who wish to switch their current job data related field. There are 2 things that make me wonder and I don't think you have covered them yet. 1. Can you think of any area or business where we can gain some experience before applying for job? As most of your subscribers would have some theory knowledge, but zero experience. 2. Can you recommend any forum for beginners where we can chat and ask each other silly questions?"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Which study is similar to data analytics? Im not getting admission in data analytics,So planning for a similar field. Kindly reply"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Thank you for taking the time out of your day to basically mentor us and inform us! Those of us that are very serious about this, owe you one once we make it to the top 👆"
w25ZjL0OqT4,Do you recommend bolding certain words or phrases on our resume that matches with the job description?
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Merry Christmas, Alex! Thank you for your honest opinions. I really appreciate it. For some evil reasons, I worked as entry-level data roles in finance, marketing, research, and manufacturing for 5 years, after obtaining BS in mathematics. Then I became the only ""data scientist"" in the R&D team of an IT startup, modelling and mining big data in collaboration with software developers and telecommunications engineers. I realize data scientist is vaguely defined and definitely not an entry-level job, so I'm doing a MS in computer science to fill the technical gap. Could you please give me some advice on how to shape my experience on resume, since I think the path from data analyst to data scientist fits me best? Thanks again!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hi Alex, just found your channel. I have a BA in Business Information Man. (2017) since then I've been struggling to find my career path and mostly unemployed. I am thinking of salvaging my old basic sql and algorithms knowledge. Since my grad date  is on the edge of expiration in the eyes of HR (i think) I am planning to re-prove myself by getting certified with an online course. Would you recommend IBM Data science from coursera as a starting point? Much appreciated!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"So funny!!! "" taking the clothes of is kind of a process"" , did you watch Popeye the Sailor, every episode he got his energy from eating ""Spinach"" to save his wife. and one more merry Christmas."
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Thanks for video, Alex. Merry Christmas!"
w25ZjL0OqT4,Which website to find to learn tableau/power BI and get certified??
w25ZjL0OqT4,lol I literally have Adobe Photoshop in my CV for data analyst.
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Excel has a data analysis add-on, which was a big focus in my recent Statistics for Behavioral Science class. It runs analysis operations like t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and regressions. Would this skill and/or this course be worth mentioning on a resume?"
w25ZjL0OqT4,U could have become a singer😜😜
w25ZjL0OqT4,"hey alex, I currently work in Digital Marketing & E-commerce. Do you think there could be a smooth transition from my field into Data analytics and also what are some things that you think I should focus on from digital marketing (google analytics for campaign tracking, using data to provide business recommendations are just a couple things i do)"
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Hey Alex, your content is amazing, it's helped me so much, is it ok if the degrees I have got have analytical and programming based modules but the degrees are more life science based"

w25ZjL0OqT4,The santa part made me laugh so hard! Great video!
w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach! Happy Holidays and thank you for such informative content! One thing I wanted to ask about was for those who are currently taking the master's route, but still have limited exposure and experience to the analytics field: under the projects section, would it be helpful to mention a few assignments done throughout the semester where we utilized languages or tools such as python, R, or tableau and wrote a research paper on them? Or are recruiters solely looking for independent projects in this section?"
w25ZjL0OqT4,Happy holidays everybody and please enjoy your spinach. ;)

w25ZjL0OqT4,"Spinach ! My only related story is that the phone I have now (pixel 3a) is FRAGILE and I replaced the screen 2-3 times before finally getting a good case for it (OtterBox rocks!) 
ANYWAYS I had to visit the repair store to do so, and while I waited for them to replace my screen, the only thing I could do was watch Popeye on their TV 😂"
w25ZjL0OqT4,you should show a sample of the resume that you would use to get jobs.

EWPeAXrF3zg,"decent video, but feels a little draggy (with watching you think) rather than informative, efficient, and to the point."
EWPeAXrF3zg,"Hi Alex, thank you for the crisp content. A suggestion: For videos in series, you can add link to all parts in description and mention in the video as well. 
Thanks again!"
EWPeAXrF3zg,We need part 3
EWPeAXrF3zg,Where is the third part pls
EWPeAXrF3zg,"Hi Alex, thank you very much, do you have the 3 part ready?"
EWPeAXrF3zg,"I am using a subquery to solve 2nd one ,But it gives me a error said
FUNCTION test.max does not exist. Check the 'Function Name Parsing and Resolution' section in the Reference Manual
and here is my code

select d.name as department , e.name as employee , salary 
from employee e join department d 
on e.departmentid = d.id 
where salary in (
select max (salary)
from 
employee
group by departmentid         # get the highest salary for each department  
)"
EWPeAXrF3zg,Hi Alex where's the part 3 of this series unable to find it. Also thanks for your content.
EWPeAXrF3zg,"FYI if there is no solution, the discuss panel usually has a lot of them to test out and compare to"
EWPeAXrF3zg,"Good evening Alex!
Your videos are very helpful to beginners such as me. I tried the last question, the highest salary, with cte like you, did and I also tried subquery but I got a little bit confused about it.
select 
    d.name as Department,
    e.Name as Employee,
    Salary
from Employee e
join Department d
on e.departmentid=d.id
where (e.DepartmentId,salary) in
(select DepartmentId,max(salary) from employee group by DepartmentId)

This answer is accepted, but why does it go wrong if ""e."" is added to the ""DepartmentId"", like ""e.DepartmentId""  in the last line?
It seems that they don't have too much difference...
Looking forward to seeing your reply.
Leon
Kind Regards"
EWPeAXrF3zg,"Very helpful! Thanks Alex. Btw, is the hard questions, part 3 available now?"

EWPeAXrF3zg,Merry christmas Alex ! Love the hat :)
EWPeAXrF3zg,"Great video! In your opinion, how hard would you say SQL questions for a data analyst internship interview compare to this?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"There is a lot of rumors that AI will replace data analyst and data science jobs, what's your take on it? Thank you for your video"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Kind of ironic saying he wouldn't put certificates on his resume, fast-forward now to where he sells certification courses..."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,☕️ time !❤
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hello Sir, I'm Sarah from Middle East Riyadh. I need to contact you ASAP for your advice regarding my new role. I need professional advice from professional people like you. How can I contact you? Thanks a lot ❤"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,for the next 3 years you'll become the inspiration for data enthusiast around the world
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I know this is two years old now, but if I don't have any prior experience, or technical bachelors or masters education, would you still advise avoiding putting a coursera certificate on my resume? I only have about 14 years experience as a production supervisor."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I disagree about degrees. it's only one method of learning and some super smart people get amazingly stressed during exams and just meltdown. Also literal people like me find it very hard to answer questions in exams as they're not clear. So many founders of great IT companies left their degrees.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Arent Entry Level and Junior not the same and are two different things?? Entry Level is usually 0 years experience straight out of college and Junior is 1 - 2 years experience.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,What are titles for a mid level ?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery 😂
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Here's a Celery joke --  I'm waiting for my first Data Analyst Celery soon to come
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"this is the most i have ever heard someone talking abt celery, and the video is not even about that🤣"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I currently work as a Sr. Data Analyst and I don’t have my Masters. Not interested in going to get it either lol.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Haha just had the experience of thinking the video had been cut off cause you were drinking your coffee 😂
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"But Alex, I thought you were recommending the Coursera certificates? Now you have mixed opinions on them? :("
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Would a General MBA work for the Senior Job?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Slurp the coffee 😂 so they know you’re still there. Jk good info on this video thank you 🙏🏾
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Haha that just happened to me. I was listening on my airpods and it went quiet so i checked the phone. Lol
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Selery is ❤because it sounds like SALARY to me. It makes me boost my skills and dedication when i hear it on 😂✌️
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Inspired by Alex & few other YouTubes, I landed an analyst position last month with SQL, intermediate PBI, and very basic Python knowledge. My team expects me to help them with Python migrating local DB to Azure which I completely have no idea about. My English is not bad but during the team meeting, I mostly remain silent and google the keywords and acronyms they use. I haven't been assigned any complex project yet but I spend almost 4-6 hours outside of my work schedule on learning and revising resources and I am so far until now very passionate about it. But what I am really worried about is the possible burnout. @Alex would you mind sharing your thoughts on it, please?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hi Sir , is this video still applicable today? or should I learn python or r as a Junior data analyst?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery! Let's go!!! Thanks Alex!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,celery
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"""Some people never watch me, I could be doing random things with my hands and they would never know""
I was making progress in the google cert im sorry!!! made me tab over XD"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery 😌
ru0Xdvxd37Q,This is really helpful!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hi Alex!  It's been a while since I found your YouTube channel and it has helped me with defining what I really would like to do. I am at the doorstep of the switch to becoming data analyst, and I really believe that on top of the technical skills, it really is the mindset and willingness to learn what it takes to progress in this field. Thank you for the informative videos, and for making me laugh in the middle of the night, listening to your complaints about celery. Try to juice it, filter, and have a shot in the morning. It does you good. ;) Cheers, Katalin"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"It seams so weird, cuz here in Russia they require you already to have Bachelors or to be in the process of obtaining one.
 Also you should already know one of the languages Python or R and obligatory SQL ( in advanced queries and most probably some window functions, yet window functionality are not required solid) and other then that they also check in on your statistics knowledge!
And it is all for Junior positions, I also had a case study on one round of the interview"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Thanks you so much. Its really helpful, am stil inl learning process. How I wish I can have you as my mentor"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Click on below link for most asked Excel Interview questions 👇
https://youtu.be/aH2m5yxIiyY"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery is only edible smothered in peanut butter.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Come on bro, I like celery."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"A bit afraid since I jumped from Jr. to Sr. in a job switch, but they understand needing to ramp up the skillsets and they have faith in me.  Granted this is going from a 300 person company to an 80 person one, so perhaps role inflation was inevitable.  Great AMA!"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Thank you Alex, good info. Have a question about the senior level Data analyst position. Just curious, if we can get into senior Data analyst position, with just 20 yrs of IT experience and bachelors degree 🙂"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Hey Alex. Just found your channel a few days ago. Thanks for explaining data analysis and videos pertaining to beginners. Ill keep surfing your videos. No idea why celery is a key word though.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Watched 10+ vdos of yours today. Let’s Cheerlery!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery 😂
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Just saw this video Alex 😅 I have to disagree about celery. Try it baked until it gets a little bit brown. Add spices and Humus. You will love it ;)
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Now this is good content
ru0Xdvxd37Q,celery
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I'm a senior but my company doesn't use any R or Python, I do know Python but not comfortable with it because my word doesn't require it, it could be a roadblock when I think of moving to other firm :-?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery? Lol
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"You need celery for concurrent task programming in Django. So it has that going for it I guess…

You also don’t have to eat it then, so that’s a win!"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Lol I just paused what I was doing to check why my phone went silent.. I will get used to you pausing.. new to the channel loving your content.. currently in an IT industry with an engineering diploma. Just enrolled in a Business Analyst course hoping to make a career switch..
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Just randomly found this on my home page. Thanks for the advice. I'm a Junior DA with a masters in engineering and was wondering about what steps I need to take to make sure I'm ready for a mid-level role
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Yes, celery is great in a Bloody Mary but while I would agree about not putting on free or paid certified or courseware from online classes but what about 'Postgraduate certificate programs' from universities?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Man, I love your channel.  Great advice, and very easy to listen to."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,you're my platonic love.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery !
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Can you start posting videos of how Phyton is used on a practical day to day basis as a data anaylst? I've started learning it (to try and achieve Mid Level status) but apart from the basics, its hard to narrow down where to start for a data anaylst"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,i thought the video stopped when you drank coffee XD
ru0Xdvxd37Q,What the heck dude. Put celery salt on a hotdog and experience the pleasure!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Great content!
As someone who has a Masters degree in Analytics and 4 years of work experience as a Data Analyst in total (including 2 years at the current company), I have now received an offer from another team in my current organization for an opportunity to handle supply chain optimization. The title being offered is Supply Chain Engineer. 
Should I consider this ? Will this be a good opportunity for my career?
As mentioned earlier I have completed 2 years at the company and I also think I should start asking for a promotion to my current team for a Senior Data Analyst. Your thoughts on that ?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Thanks
ru0Xdvxd37Q,celery is nice with fresh mayo and carrot!!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,celery  haha
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hi Alex, now that you’ve gone over the Google Certificate, have you changed your views on certificates? Especially for people who do not have experience and/or a Bachelor’s Degree."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,My daughter loves Celery! How are you doing man ! Thanks for helping me!!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"As someone with a PhD in Political Science + 3 postdocs and making the leap from academia to data analysis, I sincerely thank you for your invaluable advice!"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Do I need a Bachelors or Master's Degree to get an entry level Junior Analyst potition? Or is a Google Professional Certificate in Data Analytics enough?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery is great in soups
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I'm listening to your shows while working so, celery 😁"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Hi Alex! can you include your episodes in a podcast format as well as videos? Thanks! Love your channel!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I started to watch on the end. There's coffee talk. There's vegetable word (celery). I'm confused Alex.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Great video Alex. Celery is okay in stuffing. That's the only time I eat it is probably at Thanksgiving. BTW, are you planning to enroll in a Master's program in an online program or a traditional brick and mortar school?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I have a masters degree in physics with 5+ years relevant work experience. I know python and various ml libraries. Recently started with sql and are learning subqueries right now. Just started working as a data analyst at a large company. Should I rather look for data scientist roles or is it beneficial getting some experience of working as a data analyst first?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,So there’s no chance of becoming a data analyst without a bachelors degree?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,What kind of salary range would you expect when you reach the senior level analyst?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery
ru0Xdvxd37Q,looking forward to hear more from you as you get to senior level
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I actually had to google what celery even is :D
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Great video, but is there a time window of moving through those positions?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,You just topped it with the most useful video yet!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I really want to know more about the job of 
entry level data analyst and awesome video"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Im currently working on my masters in Data Analytics at WGU. Its a competency based online program. Do you think a masters from a program like this is less favorable or less respected than a traditional masters program? Thanks alex!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hello alex, i want to apply a job as data analyst but i could not tell the level. Can i  share with the description job to your email??"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Is a Data entry job good experience to land my first junior analyst job?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Is there a reason why you didn’t mention entry level?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Alex, you're great! Very informative content. I'm currently an entry level Bus Ops Analyst for a fortune 500 and am dealing with big data and automating reports using Tableau Prep. I've come to like this a lot and am thinking of either making a career change to Data Analyst or trying to grow quicker within my role by learning skills like Python. What are your thoughts?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Will an MBA with a specialization in data analytics help or just a related MSc ?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,they sure are taking their time with the google analytics program on coursera
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I have a master's degree in Data Science and worked as a student in a company/research for 2.5 years. Of course, jobs were Data Science related. I'd say I'm on an upper mid level. What do you think?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"I transitioned to a data analytics role in my company.  I'm 9 months into a 1 year rotation through 4 departments.  
A few things come to mind:
1.  Somewhere in that middle to senior level one probably needs to think about getting some statistics skills, maybe even could be the right masters program for this field.
2.  I am concerned that a lot of the analytics roles that are so plentiful will be eliminated by the development of machine learning and the more advanced technological development of the programs such as BI and Tableau.  The field may end up over the next few years becoming a hybrid of data analytics, data science, data engineering.  
4.  I think a lot of folks also should consider advancing in a particular domain after they reach mid level analytics/data analysis.  Leaders in marketing, sales, risk ecetra all will be folks with these base data skills in the future."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,I m from india .. really loves your such advice ... Please suggest me that I have to join an institution or any online course for the data analyst course
ru0Xdvxd37Q,This is very helpful as I’m planning what skills I need to improve on and gain in order to move up.  Thanks for another great vid!
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hey, Alex.
Great content as usual.
I have a very big disadvantage compare to other candidates, which is I only have an associate degree from a community college.
This is one thing that scared me the most.
Cause almost 100 percent of jobs require at least a bachelor's degree.
Can you share your thought about it?
Thank you."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Thank you, this was really helpful! Sadly all of the entry level data analyst jobs I’ve been seeing having high expectations and require a strong technical background"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hey, Alex. Have been binging on some of your content for a while now. And largely, it has been quite informative - even the 'A Day in the Life Of' video. For this one, you asserted that an entry-level Data Analyst role might not require R or Python. I have been looking at job-descriptions in Canada for Data Analyst roles for a while now and I have to say - I have not seen any profiles that do not explicitly need Python and R, along with SQL, Tableau/Power BI, and MS Excel. 

Can you throw some more light on this? One caveat is that most of the roles I have seen are related to finance. Is the inconsistency because of the domain?"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery is the uncharismatic twin of Parsley.
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"""Ugh, celery man."" 🤣🤣"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hey there, enjoying the content so keep it up! Biggest thing I would add is you have only focused on the technical skills here and not the other aspects that come into data analytics. From a technical standpoint I personally do not think there is much of a difference between Mid level and Senior level, slight improvements yes but the biggest technical difference is between junior and mid level. 

However from a problem solving there is a big difference. e.g. junior analyst you produce the data which is ask of you, mid level you think more about what they are asking and find ways to add additional value or highlight opportunities you have notices. Senior level you are comfortable going back to a CEO or head of department level figure and asking is this really what you want because half the time they are not asking the question they really want solved. 

Final thing I would add is you skill of communicating the data, you may be able to produce the most accurate model but if you cannot communicate the findings it will likely be forgotten."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Dude, celery is an underrated veggie. It doesn't have to be the a favorite veggie but it's solid and can be a filler.  It's really good if you put it in a smoothie and mix with something naturally sweet like apples and bananas. 
And yes, it's only segment I forward to when watching your videos.  All this talk about entry level and senior level data analyst doesn't sound fun.  😁😂
Seriously thanks for another informal video about the different levels of a data analyst. Much appreciated!!"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"What are your thoughts on learning Excel VBA?
Should I bother learning Python or R instead first?
I appreciate your celery story!"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Hi Alex, I am following your fantastic videos. Thank you for them. I have some questions, but prefer to ask them by email or something like that, we can do that? Thank you"
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"Celery can be a very good weapon, my ex used it alot, but I prefer to eat it raw. Thanks for sharing, Alex."
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Celery  - is disgusting
ru0Xdvxd37Q,Does it matter what field your masters degree is in or is it just more important that you have a masters?
ru0Xdvxd37Q,"OMG! many thanks for everything you did and doing for us. I never think that my last name is so hard and i enjoyed how you pronounce it, i repeated many times, but i think it pronounce like ""bushusha"". I hope you got increased in your celery."
BAVPAYWAoC4,Been a data anlyst for three years because of this channel. Now in 2025 working hard and praying I can become a DE this year.
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I am not from an engineering background, how can I become a data engineer or analyst?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Hey alex is it possible to pivot from data analytics to data engineering?
BAVPAYWAoC4,i saw you covered career foundry for Data Analyst program. do you have a boot camp recommendation for becoming a data engineer?
BAVPAYWAoC4,Degrees are NOT necessary and don’t matter for these roles.
BAVPAYWAoC4,I have some questions. Im a little confused about the difference between data scientist and data analyst. So if you can to explain me. And another question is about how easy is to change your role from data analyst to data engineer or the opposite.
BAVPAYWAoC4,thank you so much
BAVPAYWAoC4,Data scientist tops both of them 😂😂
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Great video, very clear and concise"
BAVPAYWAoC4,thank you
BAVPAYWAoC4,The explaination was very clear🤍
BAVPAYWAoC4,Which can be considered as entry level? Data analyst or engineer
BAVPAYWAoC4,Please share anyone data analytics syllabus.
BAVPAYWAoC4,Sir which is future proof (for upcoming 20 years )
BAVPAYWAoC4,Hi Alex I'm a big fan of your videos now I'm taking your data analyst bootcamp course on YouTube and already fall in love with this course. I have one doubt doing data analyst job for 2 years and then shift to data engineering job did that previous 2 years experience in D.A count in D.E ?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Thank you for this video. Before watching this, I had a call asking me about my understanding of the data analyst and data engineer role. I knew nothing about the data engineer role and the hiring company was mostly concerned about how good I am at SQL and Python. Since I was still trying to get my feet wet through an entry level data analyst job, I am still learning Python through online videos. I was surprised that they only had a data engineer position available and did not mind that I had a commerce degree instead of the a data/statistics/math related one.

After watching this video, I'm pretty sure, as someone who has only gone through courses related to data analysis, data engineers are definitely require a whole lot more training before they can get hired relative to a data analyst."
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I love your videos and description.
However weather I was an Analyst and Engineer, I have never ever got asked about my degree during an interview. Just fyi, I have a GED."
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I prefer Data Scientist and Data Analyst compared to Data Engineer. Not sure what I prefer between Data Scientist and Data Analyst though. Due to that, I am aiming to eventually master skills from both."
BAVPAYWAoC4,Data volcano is the worst.
BAVPAYWAoC4,Im starting a data engineeer course and part of the syllabus is data visualization. Do data engineers use tableau etc?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Alex, Khafka is misspelt"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Interesting. My only remark…please speak a wee bit slower…there is no rush!😊
BAVPAYWAoC4,I have bachelors degreee in mechanical and what should i do to become either one of this position?
BAVPAYWAoC4,Which of them have bright future
BAVPAYWAoC4,Data Engineering for me.
BAVPAYWAoC4,Is data engineering really hard to do?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I'm a Data analyst, engineer, and scientist..."
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Jr Data Engineer underpaid compared to software engineer.
Thanks, but not worth it"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thank you so much for this video and all the helpful replies in the comments. It really helped me a lot to decide what I should focus on now.
BAVPAYWAoC4,"check out our latest big data video,
https://youtu.be/icGopl3KLZw"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thank you for this video ! You really helped me to clear things up for me
BAVPAYWAoC4,"thanx a lot for the full description ..
i'm a computer engineer at the time certification in marketing from edexcel ,
can i attend course in data analytics and work in that field or data engineer is more appropriate...need ur advice ..
thanks and regards"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Thanks mate, it was helpful )"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"thanks much alex for this informations , i have a small question if you can help me with it please , i am doing a career shift as a fresh graduated civil engineering to data science and i was confused about which field would be better for me to become a data engineer or data analyst, which one would be easier for me to go with and would be better in the feature as someone who would start from scratch. any advice would be appreciated. thanks much"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hello Alex, i Just stumble upon your channel, thanks for the video you put up, Please what would you recommend for someone who has intermediate knowledge of SQL? thanks in anticipation for your honest reply."
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hi Alex, is it possible to switch career from data analyst to data engineer?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thanks for this! This was super clear and well put together
BAVPAYWAoC4,Well this confirmed I dont want to be a data engineer.
BAVPAYWAoC4,Can you do a video on analytics engineer?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"very helpful , thanks Alex"
BAVPAYWAoC4,So would a career path be Data Analyst -> Engineer -> Scientist?
BAVPAYWAoC4,I know Data Scientist is a hot field right now. Is there more job postings for being a Data Scientist versus a Data Engineer?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"hello, I'm starting in data engineering, is it possible to create a startup/company, so I can earn more? I see salaries from 100 to 180k as an entrepreneur it would be possible to reach 250,350k??"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Interesting, I like these analyst vs videos, but in my experience as an data analyst, you tend to end up getting roped into aspects of all of the above, business analyst, data scientist, and data engineer"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Do you have any thoughts the BS in Data Analytics and Data Management from WGU ?
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thank you so much for video & making us aware of the data world. I have career in Data world for last 12 years. I can very well relate that how skill sets carries the stream in Data.
BAVPAYWAoC4,I'm a civil engineer with python tableau and sql experience. What else do I need to add to become a data engineer? Thanks.
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Here in India some companies expect a data analyst to know ETL , data warehousing i.e data engineering stuff"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Give me job that don’t need coding
BAVPAYWAoC4,So what is the difference between a data engineer and a data scientist? I am surprised you didn't compare all 3 in one video.
BAVPAYWAoC4,How smooth is the transition from being a data analyst to a data engineer?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Someone once said a Data Engineer is (in the simplest, layman, nutshell description): ""Half data scientist, half software engineer (or analyst/developer)."" I wonder how much of that is still true?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,If your end goal is Data Engineer should you start with Data Analyst role?
BAVPAYWAoC4,Is Java really required for data engineer jobs 🤔🤔
BAVPAYWAoC4,thanks alex it's so useful video
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I am from bcom background 
Can u suggest one ?
 i am confusing on choosing of two these jobs of data engineer or data analyst"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hai, I did a project in my course with team. We collect data from different websites and saved into our pub/sub in gcp from there we use kubernetiecs to activate our process to collect data everyweek one specific day. Once data come to pub /sub using big query we clean data and analyze data ml. And visualize using Java script on another website. Basically I designed the cloud system did api to call data to the pub sub. So am I a data engineer"
BAVPAYWAoC4,U should colab with code basics
BAVPAYWAoC4,"isn't it ""Kafka"" ? without the H? 4:39"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hi Alex, tanks for providing your expertise and information on these carriers. Could you please share good books for Data Analytics?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Thank you for your video, it has been very helpful keep up the good work"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Great content! Wow. Straight to the point and brief. Thank you
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hey Alex, just starting following your channel today and I've enjoying your videos a lot. I'm graduating from my Bachelors in Physics in June and I like programming a lot, I have learnt for the past 3 years. I also found myself archiving very good results when working with data and ""treating"" it. I'm looking for a job before I move on with a higher degree and I find myself between Software Development and Data Analytics. My fear is that working in Data Analytics I start to lose my developer side that I like so much. Anyways, what job would you say that it would be a good marriage between my scientist side and my developer side? Thank you and I'm sorry if this question is too specific :D"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hey Alex, hope your well. I am currently an undergrad HEALTH information management student and will graduate in a couple of months. Interested in become a healthcare data analyst. I know I have to lear SQL, r studio, python and sort but do I need to know a lot of math? No very good at that. Thank you!"
BAVPAYWAoC4,A Clear and Neat presentation 👌
BAVPAYWAoC4,"In my understanding, Data engineer is more like a software engineer focusing on database. It requires many technical skills. In term of number of jobs available, data engineering outweighs over data scientist and data analyst and also pays better. It’ s easier to transfer to a software engineer. 

I have no interest in data engineering but if data engineering is a better option, I might need to consider that."
BAVPAYWAoC4,I always thought that the engineer also cleanses the data.
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Great info, thanks and Merry Christmas!"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thank you for this video ❤️ help full
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hey alex, can a data analyst with 2 yrs experience become a data engineer?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hey Alex, thank you for your content. Currently I’m looking into switching careers and start in a wider field with more opportunities, I was introduced by somebody a Data Scientist boot camp , I would like to know your thoughts about this? is this worth it ? I do not have any experience in SQL, phyton, or in any of this field , however, I’m a quick learner . 

I  have experience collecting data as past jobs in a junior engineer position . but not too much experience, I have seen job postings for data analysts and data scientist that they requieres specific engineering’s, What are the odds of getting a job after doing a high intensive boot camp of 4 months ? Thank you"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I am a little confused. What I understand and know is that a Data Analyst's work can shape/determine the future of a company by finding trends and predicting behavior. So then why does a Data Engineer earn more?

Secondly, which of these two is more likely to head towards MD or CEO of a company?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Thanks for the video Alex.  Helps me validate my choice to take some part-time courses in the Data Analyst domain to upgrade my skills and find a job as a Data Analyst.  I’ve been doing some of that type of work in BA and Admin roles I’ve held in the past.   
Cheers, 
Antony"
BAVPAYWAoC4,Hey Alex! Awesome video! Do you know of any updates on the Google Career Certificate (Data Analyst Track)? Any info would be appreciated. =)
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I'm currently finishing up a data analyst track, but after watching this video I'm more curious about data engineering. Is there a minimum I can learn in data engineering (in Python and Azure in particular) as an aspiring analyst that can make me fit for a minor role as an engineer and is that practical, more lucrative for me, and/or more attractive to prospective employers? Love this channel btw, you have been a HUGE help for someone like me with NO previous technical ability."
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thank you sir for your video....I find this and the other videos you talk about interview questions are very helpful....I have been thought most of the data analytics tools...I have applied on some data analytics jobs but have not got a chance for interview...I would appreciate if you share us your experience on job search or creating network with recruiters. Thank you sir..
BAVPAYWAoC4,"What the heck is a DataOps engineer??? I've seen it while looking for jobs, and I'm not sure what it is."
BAVPAYWAoC4,"This helped so much!

The number of job descriptions that put all the skills for both down as just a data analyst position will really grind my gears now."
BAVPAYWAoC4,Can't believe it... Amazing coincidence. ... I was just completing a udemy course for the DP-900 Data Fundamentals exam preparation. This was discussed briefly... Difference between a Data Engineer and Data Analyst!!! Thanks for the video 👍
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thanks. Your contents are super relevant !!  ciao😄
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Dude, you're fucking awesome. Thanks to you I can get to know a lot of the data industry and a lot about what career is the best fit for me. Thank you. New subscriber."
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thank you for posting this! I might be starting my career as a data engineer and this clarified what I might be doing at my new job :)
BAVPAYWAoC4,every day I'm more sure that I wanna be a data analyst😂 btw next year when I finish the big data master I will have to decide😬😳
BAVPAYWAoC4,is this a repost?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Before this video even starts, I want to thank you for making it. I’ve been following your channel and found it really informative but then learned about data engineering as a career path and feel it would suit me much better and have been desperately looking for more resources about it. I already work with data and have been trying to pick up the right skills to go for data analyst positions but now want to pursue data engineering- I’m just trying to figure out how! So thank you and I would love if you could explore this area further."
BAVPAYWAoC4,You're up super early 🤓
BAVPAYWAoC4,Great video. Would you recommend someone with no degree in IT to have internship as data analyst? And what r the steps for getting that intern role?
BAVPAYWAoC4,Thanks for the video Alex😊👍
BAVPAYWAoC4,"I m from computer background but don't have domain knowledge like finance, economics so should I go for data engineer.?"
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hey Alex, great video! Does a Data Engineering position typically require experience? I can see many Data Analyst / Scientist job openings for new grads but fewer openings for Data Engineering."
BAVPAYWAoC4,Nice! Mosh said that Python Programmers with experience can make $115K in the US on average. Thoughts?
BAVPAYWAoC4,"Hi Alex love your videos. I have a business undergraduate and am planning to get into business analytics. However, as I have a 3 year degree and to get into analytics programs, I have to do a MBA of sorts
So is it better to get all these degrees or will knowledge from the internet be enough?"
whgwEwA5SHU,7:44 - thank me later
whgwEwA5SHU,Summary: share salary info with co-workers.
whgwEwA5SHU,"I’ve asked people their pay one guy was so mad and said “You don’t ask people that”. 

I continued asking people, especially since I was an independent contractor working the same position as people who worked directly for the facility. 

Usually people would tell me their rates and I would tell them my rate through the agency. 

I recently got hired by one of the facilities out of desperation, my license expired, and I’m in the process of renewing it and since I asked everybody their pay before I got on board. I know that I’m making more than anybody there except one person who has her masters and surprisingly, nobody asked me how much I make. I think they just assume I took the same rate as them. 

But I would like to know for sure, for sure ."
whgwEwA5SHU,"When people ask me, I either lie and give out a lowball wage, or I refuse to disclose the amount."
whgwEwA5SHU,Tomatoes ?
whgwEwA5SHU,3ué
whgwEwA5SHU,"ha ha, weirdest tangent."
whgwEwA5SHU,I agree that you should be able to ask this. This can backfire sometimes unfortunately though. I was about to move to another company once and then my current company offered me $2 more per hour. I didn’t feel the need to hide that information from my 3 coworkers and if I didn’t go into details on why I’m staying instead of going to the other place I was excited to go to then it would seem suspicious. My current manager got on my case a week later because during our raise evaluation my coworkers asked for more because of the offer they gave me. The $2 increase actually brought me up to my coworker who’d been there a few years longer and she was upset about it.
whgwEwA5SHU,"Meat-stuffed tomatoes with cheese on top and baked in the oven are the best! Take some tomatoes (preferably big-ish) and cut off the tops. Scoop the centre out with a spoon and fill it with grounded meat (or grounded meat mixed with rice, as I do), then cover with some grated cheese on top. Ideally, your meat should be up to around the tomato's top and the cheese somewhat over it, so everything bakes nicely and the tomato doesn't get too dry. Then stuff it into a preheated oven and cook until all looks good to eat! Will probably take around 20 minutes depending on the oven's temperature and how big the tomatoes are.

And the recipe can be adjusted however you want - take bigger tomatoes if you want to put more meat inside, or cover with a lot of cheese if that's your thing, or have a lot of small tomatoes if you're mostly in it for the veggies. Very juicy, very tasty and very easy to make!"
whgwEwA5SHU,"Tomato, gotta love them BLTs"
whgwEwA5SHU,"Hello Alex, thank you for the video.

Tomato,  the Chinese red-cooked tomato beef soup is my favorite, sharing with you the introduction link and other tomato dishes that I like below.

whgwEwA5SHU,Can we get any practice tasks from your end.....as I'm planning to choose data analyst as a career.....
whgwEwA5SHU,I had a question. How can I go about doing some type of hands-on projects? Please help me with some of those recommendations. Or if there may be a way of talking with you more direct
whgwEwA5SHU,I’m currently a junior in college and want to obtain a data analyst internship this summer. I am learning sql and will learn tableau afterwards. What do you recommend what else I can do to obtain that internship.
whgwEwA5SHU,🍅 🍅 🍅 and 🍕 ! Very valuable information don't be so hard on yourself!
whgwEwA5SHU,I know this is off topic. But you just look like Garrett Hilbert of Dude Perfect.  https://instagram.com/garretthilbert?igshid=1tesh7rcgrvns
whgwEwA5SHU,Nice sweater man
whgwEwA5SHU,"... Yeah, I do this too. I'll straight up ask anybody anything though so I've never felt any apprehension. I've also had pretty good success because I'm just a very open person in general and people know I'll also answer virtually any question.

I will say though, in my opinion, what other people are making is virtually irrelevant to what you're making. Other people making more than you is not really a good argument for why you should make more. It doesn't really say anything about *your* skills and contributions, per se. YMMV

P.S: Lasagna is great, but pizza is far and away the best. Unless you put pineapple on it. ;)"
whgwEwA5SHU,"Wow, if someone asked me that I’d be super uncomfortable and think they were down right cheeky!"
whgwEwA5SHU,Tomato in chicken curry. https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-chicken-curry
whgwEwA5SHU,"My favorite tomato dish is a Filipino recipe....  Chicken Afritada,  its chicken stew with tomatoes, carrots and potatoes. Recipe!!. . . .https://salu-salo.com/chicken-afritada/"
whgwEwA5SHU,"Hey Alex, how you doing? The new intro is impressive, i asked you last time and you didn't see it; if someone has the skill, the course on coursera of that skill is a waste of time, is that correct? and finally we have pasta with tomato on the menu of this week, but there is a claim that said that tomato is a fruit. what do you think about it?"
whgwEwA5SHU,"That's exactly what I do!! I ask my coworker who are closer to me... I wonder how do they calculate a promotion salary.. maybe the average between all the people in that position ( also depending in your education background/ work experience) .. everytime I get a promotion I do a research on glassdoor, salary.com and others to see if I am getting paid fairly. 🍅!!!"
whgwEwA5SHU,"I apologize for the off topic comment, but are you familiar with AHIMA's Clinical Health Data Analysis certification? I am studying to be a health informaticist and I was wondering if you think this certification would be impressive from an entry level health data analysist"
whgwEwA5SHU,Tomato yo!
whgwEwA5SHU,"I wish more people understood that Discussing your salary with your coworkers only helps the both of you to make sure the company doesn’t underpay you. 

Most Companies don’t want employees discussing their salaries with each other because it enables the company to pay people who are doing the same work differently. Many times newer people get paid more because it cost more to hire someone away from another company, their skills could be better, etc. 

Many people may think that if they do above average work that their salary is probably more than their peers and don’t want to share their salary to avoid jealousy or whatever other reason but most of the time companies are trying to pay you the least they can for the maximum amount of high quality work they can squeeze out of you. 

One argument I’ve heard is that “High Performers” shouldn’t share their salary because the company may pay them more than their peers doing the same job and them sharing their salary could cause conflict in the workplace; maybe even make management unhappy with them. 

However, In my experience too many people think they’re “high performers” when they’re not. We always tend to think the best of ourself and are more critical about other people than we are for ourselves. 

In some cases high performers do get paid more but they have to truly bring significant Value to the company. By value i mean they increase productivity, cut significant costs, or increase revenue significantly."
whgwEwA5SHU,"The new intro and outro are impressive!!

Also, my favorite tomato dish is a homemade pasta sauce that cooks down for 12 hours"
whgwEwA5SHU,"Yo Alex, appreciate they ""personal"" and fun bits in between. Maybe you could put timestamps in your description for the informational parts. Cheers for your content :)"
whgwEwA5SHU,🍅 Pizza 🍅
whgwEwA5SHU,"Thanks the transparency with the office politics stuff. I wish more people talked about it, but I understand it's a touchy subject. Do you think you'd make a video on the subject of HR in Analytics? Or just HR in general? Thanks for the video though! Isn't the tomato a fruit 😂? I like spaghetti!"
whgwEwA5SHU,Bullshit. Come to the point asap
whgwEwA5SHU,"OK Alex, we see that new intro 👍🏿🍅"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Are this enough
K1WeoKxLZ5o,bro u gotta work your accent couldn't get first 2 minutes of it!
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Please I am having problem with installing mysql studio. It's asking me to repair and I've done that tens of time. Please I need assistance. My system has all the requirements
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Please I am having problem with installing mysql studio. It's asking me to repair and I've done that tens of time. Please I need assistance. My system has all the requirements.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,You didn't capitalize SELECT at 1:53 and it's haunting me
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Clear and simple.
New sub."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,4 (Four) years ago but we ball.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Very helpful thank you
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I didn't understand anything. You did not cover the most important parts. You just covered: How to implement them - You didn't say what it is, when to use it, why use it, how it works ...."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Your voice sounds like JD Vance :)
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Where are queries for creating tables that you are using?

I am following all the videos from Beginner playlist but haven't found any."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Hey there, i have a question please, whats the difference between subqueries and CTEs ?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,My man added Toby back on the payroll 🤣
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Question, do you think that CTE has better performance than creating a Temp Table? For Example by doing a Create Table and inserting into it?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I love how chatgpt lead me to this tutorial. Seems like you are indeed the GOAT in SQL tutorials, Alex."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Have you done any other Microsoft sql server classes or just the MySQL classes? Essentially where should I continue on with sql after you beginner, intermediate and advanced videos?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I'm still a little fuzzy on why you would use CTE vs just creating a subquery??
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"CTE is really a breaking head on SQL, it's kind of the only thing I can't really manage well."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Cte's is like virtual tables but vuartual tables does exist unlike ctes's
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I keep getting an error when running this query.  ""Msg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 9
Incorrect syntax near ')'."" Can someone please help me out? I have looked it multiple times and I don't see what I'm doing wrong. Thank you"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"This video is invaluable! I’m in a beginner without any coding experience, hence I’m currently in a community college. The prof and book’s explains lesson so complex and out of touch to beginners that it’s hard to visualize, unlike this simple 3.5 min example. Appreciate this"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"For those who want to copy paste....


WITH CTE_Employee as 
(SELECT FirstName, LastName, Gender, Salary
, COUNT (Gender) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as TotalGender
, AVG (Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as AvgSalary
FROM [SQL Tutorial].dbo.EmployeeDemographics as emp
	join [SQL Tutorial]..EmployeeSalary as sal
		on emp.EmployeeID = sal.EmployeeID
WHERE Salary > '45000'
)

also noticed that instead of having "".dbo"" you just input "".."" and it had the same result. Thank you!"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I attempted to alias Salary to S in the CTE but it didn't work. IDK y but I just wanted to mention it
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Hey Alex, I think you have not uploaded your video about sub queries. Hope you see this comment and upload it. I love your videos. Hope to see more of your content. 🙂"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Im Confused about why we need WITH
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"For people who work on mySQLWorkbench , this is how we concatenate two columns : SELECT FirstName,LastName, CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname) as full_name FROM employeedemographics"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Keep up the good work
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Very comprehensive
K1WeoKxLZ5o,do you have an email where we can ask you some clarifying questions?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Then why we using CTE it's just like   SELECT
K1WeoKxLZ5o,why is 45000 considered as a varchar in that CTE?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,How come the average salary is over partition by Gender?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Your explanation is so clear and very easy to understand regardless of ppl's background. Simply saying thank you is not enough to express our feelings.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"This is my third time learning about CTE's but I'm still struggling to understand the purpose of them. 😟 When is it more beneficial to use a CTE vs subqueries, HAVING statements, or PARTITION BY?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Great videos and playlist Alex. They have really helped me learn SQL at a pace I didn't think was possible. While still being interesting and engaging.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"With ""SELECT INTO TEMPORARY <table>..."" would make it possible to use the temp table in more than one SQL statement in one transaction."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Very helpfullll🫱🏽‍🫲🏻🫱🏽‍🫲🏻🫱🏽‍🫲🏻👍🏽
K1WeoKxLZ5o,So I can do what ever I want and it doesn't effect the original database?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you so much
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"following everything but it appears that the syntax used in the video is now outdated? unfortunately, i cannot follow along well because i keep receiving errors.."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,The easiest understanding of CTE's I have ever seen. Thank you Alex
K1WeoKxLZ5o,CTE is amazing
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"On my journey through the boot camp...

Advance!"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,thanks
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I am doing exactly what you are doing however it does the gender count correctly BUT not the average Salary. My average salary column returns exactly the same values as salary column :(
K1WeoKxLZ5o,it is like inheritance of programming lang
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I really like your content and I'm a Huge fan of your broad smile :D
I have a request, could you please make few more videos on Advance SQL featuring Rank, dense rank, aggregate functions as window functions etc. I need to understand in what scenario we can use which function accurately."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Hi Alex, How are you? I am following and practising the 'CTE' statement, but I get the message as 'invalid object name 'CTE_Employee'. Can you tell me where I am wrong? Thanks. 
These are the queries:
with CTE_Employee as
(select FirstName, lastname, gender, salary,
count(gender) over(partition by gender) as totalgender,
avg(salary) over(partition by gender) as AverSalary
from EmployeeDemographics as Ed
join EmployeeSalary as Es 
on ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
where Salary > '45000')
select *
from CTE_Employee"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"you are really a great person, thank you so much"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"This is finally the ""hello world"" app from which I can understand CTEs."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you Alex for creating such helpful series...more power to you👍
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"This would be more helpful with a few use cases, bc it looks like there's no point to this when temp tables exist... right? When would CTEs be better than temp tables?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I'm not sure to understand why would we use CTE over a sub query ?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,My cte employee is showing error object invalid what does it means
K1WeoKxLZ5o,did you really just copy and paste the whole thing from another video? how is this an Advanced tutorial if you don't show all the steps?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"so, it's like a function, right?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Can you use the CTE to do joins or unions before your actual end query?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you!!
K1WeoKxLZ5o,You are very loyal . I really respect u because you give us a chance to love our dreams to become a data analyst
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you for this
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"OMG! Thank you SO very much for this simple tutorial. You are the only person who said, take your existing code and simply encase it all into the WITH clause and then SELECT * the clause. I had spent hours chasing deadends until I stumbled onto your tutorial. Many, MANY thanks!! 😊"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I just did this in DataCamp, and, although I completed the exercise OK, I felt that I didn't really get it. Now I feel that I do."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Two years ago but still educative. I appreciate you, Alex."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Slow and steady, it's all making sense, did some practice questions on Stratascratch and couldn't get past. But now I think once I'm done with the Intermediate Section I should be able to take on more challenges."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"hey man you  doing a great work, thanks for sharing your knowledge"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Great Video
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Done
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Perfect veideo! Was very clear and efficient video for understanding CTE's
K1WeoKxLZ5o,CTEs are the best. So many use-case scenarios for this.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,New to learning SQL through your channel and it has been great. One question I have is when would be an appropriate time to use CTE's? Feel like I get it but unsure of when exactly it would be used
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Code that he pasted in:

WITH CTE_Employee as (
SELECT Firstname, lastname, gender, salary, count(gender) over (PARTITION by gender) as totalgender,
avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY gender) as avgsal
FROM employeedemographics dem join employeesalary sal
ON dem.employeeid = sal.employeeid
where salary > '45000'
)"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I know this a bit old but I cannot wrap my head around a use case for these ; I'm sure it will come to me eventually lol.  Wonderful series . I've been really intimidated by a couple of these concepts up until now.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I keep taking courses on coursera and datacamp and I understand nothing and every time I end up understanding concepts from your videos. you are amazing, keep it up!"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Great video! Do you find that performance is better on a CTE or a temp table? Let's say my underlining dataset is 6 million rows. If I wanted to do the ""heavy lifting"" and break it down to a more manageable size to then query off of would a CTE or a temp table be better?

Thanks"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"As an enterprise data analyst I use CTEs, subqueries and temp tables regularly.  However I have never really looked into the benefits from a performance perspective of using one over the other.  It would be an interesting video I think."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"What does this mean ->  "" OVER (PARTITION by Gender) "" ... ??"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Expected this to be complicated. Grateful Alex that you've simplified a seemingly complex query. THX!
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Here to mark today's attendance
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Hey Alex I'm sorry I'm confused. Is this the first in the Advanced SQL Tutorial set? It seems to suggest I should be mastering the TEMP TABLES and the SUBQUERIES.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"AS AN FRESHER IN DATA ANALYST MUST I ALSO KNOW CTE
WHAT ARE THE OTHER TOPICS MUST I KNOW."
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Hey! What are those double points after SQLTutorial ?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Thanks for sharing this Alex. It seems you are using the MsSQL Server IDE. In the PgAdmin IDE, might there be a way to join multiple CTE tables ?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"Hi Alex! Please correct me if I'm wrong; CTEs are the same as a ""function"" in Python. Correct?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you!)
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"It was really useful, Thank you so much ❤️"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Amazing tutorial! So easy to understand and straight to the point. Thank you!
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thanks.. 👌
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Could help to explain in what scenario we could use CTE? When we face.....?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"The way you explain open my mind than reading from the website elsewhere, very easy to understand, thanks"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,A3:15 what does it mean its gonna work only after the direct CTE I have made?
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Anyone know which video he's referencing where he built that query that was added into the WITH statement? Curious about the 'OVER ( PARTITION by' statement.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"You explained this very well and simply! Great demo, thanks"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thank you for a great example and lesson. Still a bit confused about how aggregate functions are used without a group-by clause.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"so using Temporary Table is more powerful than CTE, because it still stored during the session, right?
is there any benefits for using CTE over temp Table ?"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Thanks for your hard work Alex!
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I can't thank you more Alex.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,Did he add Toby? I dont have him in results when i run my query
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"This is so dope, thank you!!!"
K1WeoKxLZ5o,I find this is a very poor tutorial compared with the other two CTE videos I just watched.  Those show simple examples of how CTEs can be used to solve everyday querying tasks.  This video has none of that.
K1WeoKxLZ5o,"I have a very basic question, why not create different tables? Why would CTE have an advantage?"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Thanks Ax a refresher of this salary video would be very welcomed 5 years later and with the irruption of AI, or is it the same salary ranges? Why aren’t you 120k+ with all your expertise?"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,I see mushrooms everywhere after this show! What did you put into that coffee?
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hey, didn't know you were a fellow Texan! Represent!🇨🇱"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,mushrooms
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Mushroom!

Great content Alex. Thank you.

I wonder if all of this applies to remote jobs. Or what can we expect by applying from abroad?

If anybody in the community knows I'll appreciate it."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hi Alex
I'm almost done with the last portfolio project on python (4/4). I'm good at SQL, Excel, Tableau and python. Wanna know if it's possible to have a remote job while being in Africa. If yes, what could be my chances with regards to the global job market."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mama's mushroom tastes sweet

0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hey Alex, please help. So I’m currently working as a mechanical engineer at DC and I’m thinking about self learn and becoming a DA. The biggest reason is because of salary. Im working at a pretty large engineering company right now(over 15000 people globally), my starting salary is 75k, and almost everyone at the company gets a promotion every 2 years and get a salary increase of about 8% (asked a couple ppl within the company to confirm these numbers). So im basically expecting to get paid around 100k in 6 years (which is not bad, dont get me wrong, but i just want to explore other/better opportunities). However, 2 of my friends who’s working as data analyst at a local marketing company that has less than 200 employees in Maryland, started with similar salary, and gets a raise of 7500 dollars for just working there for 6 month, and expect to get a raise every 6 month at least for the first couple of years(someone we know worked there for 2 years and already making 120k). But, by looking at all the glassdoor/linkedin data, and your video, DAs dont make that much, so do you think this company is an exception? Or would you say most DAs actually do get an increase jn salary that fast? Thanks"

0HRgbb1PcDQ,You're giving us great content for free. That means you get to enjoy your coffee while shooting :)
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"I doubt you will read this @alextheanalysis but just a tip, when you explain about not wanting to go over time, all you are doing is elongating the time. Just some food for thought. Like yucky mushrooms. lol"

0HRgbb1PcDQ,My first data job. Senior revenue management analyst 65K a year.
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"I also thought 47k was a big salary until I found out tech companies pay 6 figures no problem. I agree that you have to temper your expectations since the market is saturated but if you can financially and mentally handle it don't settle for these underpaid positions. On blind, there's lots of info about getting data analyst positions at tech companies."

0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"As someone that is immensely happy to have stumbled upon your channel, that is going through a career transition somewhat similar to your path, and in their late 30's now - Ain't no party like a Mushroooooooooooom party, cuz a 'shroom party don't stahp."

0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom 💯
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom squad! I am about to embark on the journey to be a data analyst. Your videos help keep me motivated!
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom. Made it to the end but didn't notice the length of this at all.
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"i don't hear anything from the mic when you drink coffee, i would say you are good to go!"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom 🤙
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom squad
0HRgbb1PcDQ,I don’t mind your sipping coffee ☕️
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"I amazed at how flat wages are there in the US. 17 years ago, I made $60k for an analyst job in the midwest at a hospital. I moved here 15 years ago and my salary doubled overnight to 120k. Everyone has healthcare here so no need to worry about that either."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Fried mushrooms go very well together with fried potatoes btw, so it's a good continuation for the last episode!"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushrooms! Thank you!
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Does data analytics or ux design have a better scope?
0HRgbb1PcDQ,mushrooms?  they're okay.
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Alex endorses magic mushrooms lol
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Found you the night before an interview and couldn't be more glad!
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"I graduated with a degree in statistics this spring, have taken cs courses like data structures / discrete structures and several data science & statistical modeling courses. I’m familiar with SQL, R, and python. What’s my next step to take in order to get a data analyst job ?"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"I’m doing MS in Business Analytics. According to my school, the graduates in 2019 made 86,000 on average , but most of my classmates are new to this filed, so I feel like I’m ripped off lol
There is no way fresh graduates make 86k on average"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Try cook mushrooms with black coffee and drink it. Thanks for sharing!!
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Your channel is the best... no contest..  You always address all the questions with truth, which is really important in this area. Congratulations from Brazil."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,How long did it take to become a junior analyst? 🤔
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hey Alex, how important is it to know ER-Diagrams, like Crow-foot Notation?"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Mushrooms!! 🍄 Do you recommend asking about 401k, bonuses, health insurance etc. during your job interview or when you get the job offer?"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Do you have any update on google's data analyst course in  Coursera ? When is it being made available?
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"$76,000 per year at 40 hrs per week is $36.54 per hr."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hi Alex, thanks for being so transparent with your experiences.   Wondering in your day to day job I believe you've said that you use SQL server, but what do you use in terms of an IDE or text editor for your python tasks?  Do you use python on a regular basis?  Thanks"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,I just started liking mushrooms. 🍄 Is the job title Data Quality Analyst a specific path to becoming a Data Analyst? Is that job in the Data Analytics career field? What would starting salary be for something like that?
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"mushroom squad are here, thank you Alex for keep motivating me every week"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"I just got accepted to the  Data Analytics bootcamp I interviewed for last month. I'm so excited to start this new chapter of my life, I feel like I'm high on mushrooms lol. Thanks Alex, your videos were a big help in the decision making process!"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"🍄 Funny story, an ad ran exactly when you took a sip of coffee and I couldn’t stop laughing😂 Can’t confirm I didn’t hear anything, so I no feedback for me, but seeing this very chill format rocks~ ☕️"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Would you agree that data analytics has a lower barrier to entry than data engineering?
0HRgbb1PcDQ,I absolutely love mushrooms! #mushroom_squad
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hi Alex, you're very lucky with your salary because It's lower in Europe (in my case in Spain). I know that everything is more expensive in US but surely you save more money all the month. Nice to do a video about this topic because in France for example, we don't speak a lot about salary, It's ""chocking"" for some people, the differences can be very significative."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushroom
0HRgbb1PcDQ,🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄 Very fun videos =]
0HRgbb1PcDQ,Mushrooms! I'm also super glad to be a part of your 25 favorite subscribers!
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Mushroom, you got a great voice.
Also sipping coffee doesn't bother at all"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,mushroom :)
0HRgbb1PcDQ,🍄  🥸
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Mmm, shiitake mushrooms. Thanks for being totally transparent with salary, Alex. It helps a lot for those like myself who are considering a career change. Like you mentioned, salary matters & it may not be the only reason why we work the jobs we do but it's still an important factor."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,MUSHROOMS
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"🍄 enjoy your coffee ! Don't worry so much about the time .. 2X speed, and listen in sections is always an option. Also, I heard an audiobook called ""I will teach you to be rich"" by Ramit Sethi that has some good information on 401ks , which is what convinced me to get one at my last job. Also, salute to you for giving out all of this valuable information for free !"
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hey Alex! I had commented on an older vid that I was in the market again, figured I'd just follow up and say I did manage to land a new job! With a sizable pay increase too! Cheers."
0HRgbb1PcDQ,What is your opinion about changing jobs right now during the pandemic?
0HRgbb1PcDQ,"Hello Mr. Alex. I would love to watch your video on ""How much Math is required to become a Data Analyst""  As I have no Mathematical background and I am really interested to switch my career from a Lawyer to Data Analyst. Regards"
D6XNlTfglW4,You know it's serious when the thumbnail has the suit
D6XNlTfglW4,"Please can someone help, I don't have Toby Flenderson data when I run the code for the partition by"
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you! Clear explanation.
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you
D6XNlTfglW4,i cant express how easy this was to understand. Thank you Alex so much
D6XNlTfglW4,You always remind me of the Tim Ferriss of SQL
D6XNlTfglW4,"I have a doubt, why there is no dbo in the middle?"
D6XNlTfglW4,Thx man!
D6XNlTfglW4,"Hi Alex, 

When you explain the last query at the end, the one with aliasing to abbreviate the table names, in that query you use a Left Join. . What is the Left Join returning to us? Don't you mean Left  outer  join?"
D6XNlTfglW4,very bad example to show the basic fundamental
D6XNlTfglW4,this might be the best SQL video I have ever watched
D6XNlTfglW4,Over seems to work like a cross join right?
D6XNlTfglW4,"I must Say Alex your Course is awsome , i just Started from Scratch , it is really really good"
D6XNlTfglW4,Great video thank you
D6XNlTfglW4,"where is Data types, Creating Views, GETDATE, Primary Key Vs Foreign Key??"
D6XNlTfglW4,THANKS
D6XNlTfglW4,Thanks for explaining so well
D6XNlTfglW4,You mean in each line.
D6XNlTfglW4,Basically the difference between summarise or mutate in R (or count/add_count)
D6XNlTfglW4,"simple example, perfect demonstration. Thank you, Alex!"
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you 😊
D6XNlTfglW4,"commendable work , if you start solving more real time problem like from leetcode and hackerrank - it would be a blast"
D6XNlTfglW4,I am a beginner in SQL and I didn't understand this. Kindly explain things a bit slowly and thoroughly so that beginners can catch up. Thanks.
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thank you so much for showing what the difference is. I'm working on a project using ChatGPT, and it used a partition by line. I had no idea what it was but you cleared it up!"
D6XNlTfglW4,Loved The Office data.
D6XNlTfglW4,Good explanation .... thanks!
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you Alex . for the first time i have understood the use of partition by
D6XNlTfglW4,awesome lessons
D6XNlTfglW4,Where the dbo part in the table name??
D6XNlTfglW4,"Hey guys, Maybe anyone can help me, Last video we deleted row number 1005, how you put it back?

thank you so much for the tutorial in advance mate!!! Very accurate"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thanks for the course, Alex. I'm working through for the first time having no prior experience. Playing around I calculated the average pay by gender and how far each employee is from the average using partition by and am completely amazed. This is really cool! You've done a great job laying it out."
D6XNlTfglW4,"Hi Alex. I have been practicing the Case Stements while learning
I get an error while running this query. It says error next to CASE
 SELECT *
CASE
      WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'High Class'
      ELSE 'Low Class'
END
FROM EmployeeSalary"
D6XNlTfglW4,now that's why he's the goat the goat.
D6XNlTfglW4,so this is window finction ?
D6XNlTfglW4,"DAY 3 of taking this course, and I finished Intermediate level SQL, thank you"
D6XNlTfglW4,"thank you sir , i appreciate your hard work"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Hasn't anyone noticed ""The Office"" reference? ANYONE? JESUS........"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Can somebody explain why, when I use partition by, is returning only 2 values from the list and not the all of them?"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Whoa!! I had no idea you can do this with PARTITION BY, all this time I've been using subqueries to get this result."
D6XNlTfglW4,"On my journey through the boot camp...

Understanding the GROUP BY statement is becoming more clear as it is compared to other statements. Thank you."
D6XNlTfglW4,thanks
D6XNlTfglW4,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for your videos, you are a life saver. I was wondering: why don't you add the aliases to the beginning of the SELECT statement? (ie. dem.FirstName, dem.LastName, dem.Gender?) TIA! Or if anyone else could help me answer this question that would be great."
D6XNlTfglW4,"""We have to group by all of the selected columns"" .... This is the first time I hear this life-saving statement ... I have been getting this error many times for months and could not discover this myself nor did I heard it ever from any tutuor!
Congrats for the new subscriber = Me!"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Great lessons, thx Alex"
D6XNlTfglW4,Where we can find the database ? thanks
D6XNlTfglW4,Is there a website or practices problems out there to not loose SQL skills ? Also how do you prepare for a SQL Interview test ?
D6XNlTfglW4,Lucky video 13 piqued my interest.
D6XNlTfglW4,Thanks for such a well explained content. I was able to visualize and understand clearly.
D6XNlTfglW4,At :40 did he have some shortcut to bring up those queries? Or was that just a jump scare? I tried the shortcut from the Object Explorer and that's not what it brings up.
D6XNlTfglW4,"Example:
AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY CompanyDepartment)

First, look at the ""PARTITION BY CompanyDepartment."" This means to find all the possible groups in that column, CompanyDepartment. So let's say that all the possible groups are Sales Department, Marketing Department, and Engineering Department. 

Now, take a look at the ""AVG(Salary)."" This means that for each group (which we found above), find the AVG(Salary) for that group. For this example, this means that for the Sales Department, find the AVG(Salary) for that department. And same for the Marketing Department and Engineering Department.

This is my thought process for how to think of PARTITION BY, but everyone has their own thought process, so if your way works, then it works!

I hope this helps!"
D6XNlTfglW4,"I dont know why but i dont understand the what the partition by is for?  Like i saw the difference in results between partion by and group by, but I rewatched the video a few times but it wont really click for me lol"
D6XNlTfglW4,so they do the same thing but partition is prettier?
D6XNlTfglW4,Are there any websites you guys recommend to practice allow with for free?
D6XNlTfglW4,"I Just Finish The Intermediate SQL Tutorial, And Now I Write Every Single Word With A Capital Letter Just Like SQL Query: D"
D6XNlTfglW4,You knew its going to be a great tutorial when you saw The Office crew in that table 😂
D6XNlTfglW4,"If you are following along here, be sure to add Toby Flenderson back to the EmployeeDemographics table..
Insert into SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics values
(1005, 'Toby', 'Flenderson', 32, 'Male')"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Makes sense, thanks Alex!"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Very helful, do we have any plateform to practice."
D6XNlTfglW4,An even more useful analysis here can be done using AVG(Salary) instead of COUNT(Gender). This will give the average salaries of each gender which can be compared to each other and can also be compared to each individuals salary wrt their gender.
D6XNlTfglW4,Hello again
D6XNlTfglW4,"Two years ago but still educative. Thank you, Alex."
D6XNlTfglW4,"If you are like me who reached this part of the bootcamp but have nothing to practice to, try this assessment created by chatGPT.

D6XNlTfglW4,Simple and useful. Thanks a lot!
D6XNlTfglW4,"This makes sense, so partition by just allows us see everything spread out, instead of the GROUP By.
Question, will we still need to use ""HAVING"" Instead of ""WHERE"" ? 

I'm just asking this to help other viewers curiosity lol"
D6XNlTfglW4,Never used partition by in old SQL versions.
D6XNlTfglW4,"I stumbled across your videos and I must say that they are the best.  I like the chunking.  You have the voice (tone, volume, etc) that makes it comfortable to listen to.  I finally got to topics that were hard for me to understand but you break it down so eloquently.  Thanks you for what you have and are doing.  I want to better develop my skills as a Data Analyst and you are assisting in that."
D6XNlTfglW4,Simple and clear. Thank you !
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you so much @Alex
D6XNlTfglW4,Assistant to the Regional Manager earns more than Jim 🤣 wao
D6XNlTfglW4,"جزى الله الشدائد كل خير *** وان كانت تغصصني بريقي
وما شكري لها حمدا ولكن *** عرفت بها عدوي من صديقي

just would like to thank you, the way i thank great guys like you in my language ""Arabic"". i have done the beginners tut and just completed the intermediate. it cannot be easier than the way you have explained it. once thanks a ton and wish you the best of luck"
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you! ♥
D6XNlTfglW4,"If I wanted to do the same gender count, but with a filter just say salary with an amount greater than X, how do I get the count to show the filtered results and not the pre filter result?"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Hey Alex, I love it! Glad to see that you used The Office (TV Series) cast names ;)"
D6XNlTfglW4,"See, Partition by would have been REALLY great to know when I was trying to get a ""total sum"" of a given inventory item that was broken down by lots in a location. For example. Item 123 could have lot a, lot b and lot c in 1 location. there might be 2 in one lot, 3 in another and 5 in another.  My solution was to subquery the ""Sum all items in a location"" then ""Inner join"" that sum and join on the Item Location (as that will always be unique)... so instead of having a really large query, this partition by would have shrunk the query down to an easy to read ""Look here is the items, their locations and total sum of all the lots in each location.. 

Well.. better late than never."
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thanks, Alex!"
D6XNlTfglW4,oh man this is a very good explanation
D6XNlTfglW4,You never broke down the partition by syntax 😅
D6XNlTfglW4,"Didn't understand your example, can you suggest me some supplement reading to be able to understand partitioning (and your video on it) a little better."
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thank you, Sir. All Good to you"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thank you, Alex. This is the best explanation of GROUP BY statement, for me: ""The GROUP BY statement is going to reduce the number of rows in our output by actually rolling them up and then calculating the sums or averages for each group.""
You make things so easy to understand."
D6XNlTfglW4,"Great video, very comprehensive!"
D6XNlTfglW4,"So is the ""dbo"" not needed in general when referring to the tables?  Dipping my toes in SQL and these videos are really helpful, much appreciated."
D6XNlTfglW4,"you are awesome, keep doing videos please! "
D6XNlTfglW4,Thank you!
D6XNlTfglW4,"Thanks Alex, great tutorial."
D6XNlTfglW4,"At this point I'm just gonna spam your videos with comments anyway, but again excellent video Alex. Know in your heart that your videos help others like me who wanna switch career to the data field by a lot! Your videos have amazing content, well organized, concise and have saved me a lot of time compared to watching 3 hours long tutorials. May life treat you well as it should!"
D6XNlTfglW4,"hey u know what , you are gem."
D6XNlTfglW4,Unless posted elsewhere might be a decent idea to show more about window functions and how you can even use it things like having rolling counter or much more IMO.
D6XNlTfglW4,"I tried this, but by partitioning by a column with an aggregate function SUM( invoice_total).  It didn't work as expected. 
SELECT [supp_idx],[inv_InvoiceTotal] 
	  ,SUM(inv_InvoiceTotal) OVER (PARTITION BY inv_InvoiceTotal) AS GrandTotalsBySupplier
  FROM [INVOICES] order by supp_idx

Yielded (sample output) crazy data:
supp_idx	inv_InvoiceTotal	GrandTotalsBySupplier
158			412.56				1650.24
158			412.56				1650.24
158			412.64				412.64
158			404.60				1618.40
158			404.68				809.36
158			404.68				809.36
158			404.69				809.38
158			403.50				3631.50
158			403.50				3631.50

I expected to see the third column all have the value of
122956851.41

When I did it by the COUNT, it showed the correct count
  SELECT [supp_idx],[inv_InvoiceTotal] 
	  ,COUNT(supp_idx) OVER (PARTITION BY supp_idx) AS TotalInvoicesBySupplier
  FROM [INVOICES] order by supp_idx

supp_idx	inv_InvoiceTotal	TotalInvoicesBySupplier
158			111.64				74606
158			192.66				74606
158			54.78				74606
158			28.50				74606
158			590.90				74606
158			46.83				74606
158			8779.32				74606
158			2152.05				74606
158			7327.21				74606

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INVOICES WHERE supp_idx = 158
 output:  74606

Why does one aggregate function work and the other not?
I followed the advice to remove the order by, but it appears to be doing a running total."
D6XNlTfglW4,"Your contents have given me direction in my journey to being a Data Analyst. Thank you Alex. I was thinking, what's the difference between the PARTITION and ORDER BY?

 would it be possible to achieve the same result using an ORDER BY Gender ASC, function after the ""ON"" clause?"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Alex The Analyst, why are we having 'SQLTutorial..EmployeeDemographics' in this video instead of 'SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics'?"
D6XNlTfglW4,"Good job alex, Just completed your basics and intermediate playlist. I have SQL as a chapter in middle school."
D6XNlTfglW4,Thanks! Help a lot!
D6XNlTfglW4,this one is great. it's very similar to a fixed calculation from tableau
D6XNlTfglW4,thanks for this.
D6XNlTfglW4,love the series
D6XNlTfglW4,"Had to watch this a few times to let it sink in, but great job, thanks for a simple example!"
D6XNlTfglW4,Thanks so much!  Way better than Data Camp! :)
D6XNlTfglW4,Done
D6XNlTfglW4,Good video.
MQ5UUNjWgug,Do you need to have a lot of math ?
MQ5UUNjWgug,"I was wanting to ask, can you do part time work to begin? I work in a position now that I enjoy but at some point want a job that still is challenging. 

Are you a sports fan? just heard you say non-data analyst questions lol."
MQ5UUNjWgug,"I’m struggling with python in terms of finding a quality course that fits my learning style.   How deep do I have to go into python to become a data analyst? Would a data analysis with python course on Udemy be sufficient, or do I have to do a full python boot camp?"
MQ5UUNjWgug,"Hi Alex, hope you're well, thank you for your video, It help me to keep motivate, learn new things and to be aware of the Data analytics field. 
I couldn't be present at the Q/A , so I would like to know if you work only in English? The second question is if you're learning some languages ?"
MQ5UUNjWgug,"Have you ever consider creating your own udemy courses, based od what you have learned and what you faced when working as a DA?"
MQ5UUNjWgug,I missed this again :( I really want to ask you that why we have to learn both SQL and Python for data analytics? Could we focus on Python only? Thanks
MQ5UUNjWgug,I can't believe I missed this! Replaying it now with my morning coffee 😀 Ps. Our Christmas tree looks very similar to yours and I think we have the same fireplace video in the background.
MQ5UUNjWgug,"56:44

Thank You Alex for your input 🙏. Yes the way i asked it was waay confusing. But you got the point right 😁"

JikLVP9DkPs,"Potatoes my fav! 🥔🥔🥔!

JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes!😁I can’t stop listening to your videos till the end. Way to go!
JikLVP9DkPs,"Great episode Alex! Could you make a video about what to learn, focus on, work on to make the jump from entry-level data analyst to mid-level?
You say a lot of your audience watches your channel to land their first job (that was me once upon a time!), but now I'm looking for my 2nd job and am wondering what insights you have to share that could help me do that"
JikLVP9DkPs,"Do you think without the bachelor degree in science one could still have a shot? (Also, I am from Europe)"
JikLVP9DkPs,🥔 🥔 🥔 Nom Nom! #Vegetablebased
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hi Alex, thank you for theses helpful videos. I think I'm actually where you were when you got out of college, I'm a newly graduate student in chemistry attempting to start a career in data. Most of these jobs postings require a bachelor degree in computer science and 2+ years of experience which I obviously don't have and don't know where to find the equivalent of. Do you think that studying skills like SQL, BI and stuff well enough would do or there are jobs even below the entry-level that I should start?"
JikLVP9DkPs,“I’m really appreciative today!” Potato

Thnaks for the good examples, that was really good, and no, I cant not hear you sipping. LOL"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes!
JikLVP9DkPs,Potato!! This is the first time commenting on any youtube channel and I'm learning a lot of insights by watching your channel! Thanks a lot for all useful contents
JikLVP9DkPs,"I'm 67 with 37 years experience in IT. No degree.  I started programming COBOL on mainframes. I spent 15 years parsing data using a regex generating tool to gather information from 100+ reports, formatting the data to load into Oracle and then running stored procedures to create 25 excel workbooks.
Right now I'd like to do data analyticsas i'm very familiar with excel and SQL, although I do need to work on charts and tableau. I understand the basics of OOP languages having done some Java/Selenium for automated testing.
Now the question: Are they going to hod my lack of a degree against me? I have about 100 credits, but stopped when our son was born(he's 26 now, and a software developer)."
JikLVP9DkPs,"Lol potatoes aka spuds, it's funny how spuds name came about, worth a quick Google search!"
JikLVP9DkPs,Thanks Alex
JikLVP9DkPs,You really get down to the potatoes of the subject. Thank you 😅
JikLVP9DkPs,I'm just here to find out what more I need to know to jump from entry to a mid-level analyst 👌🏿👌🏿

How are you?"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes ;). Hope this helps your stats. Loving you content as I build my skills and consider a career change. Thank you.
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hello Alex,
Just watched this amazing show, two questions, does MIS analyst job also includes data analysis since it primary use skills like excel and SQL ? Is it good to start working as a MIS analyst if I am not getting a data analyst opportunity?"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potato’s ! Thanks Alex enjoy this show 🙂
JikLVP9DkPs,"Nightshade. Boom, just went meta on you. If you want to prove to me that you got to the end of this comment start your reply with ""Shrute bucks."""
JikLVP9DkPs,🥔🥔🥔
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hi, Thank you so much for your videos, watching everything. Just to ask, have you see any data analyst entry-level position where someone can work remotely and as part-time like 4 to 5 hours daily? I will be grateful to get your feedback!"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potato head
JikLVP9DkPs,"The most universal, incredibly robust vegetable!? Are you describing Potatoes or a SQL code 😂"
JikLVP9DkPs,"“The most universal, incredibly robust vegetable” what?? 😂😂😂🙆🏾‍♂️"
JikLVP9DkPs,"Dear Alex, please make a video on how to get remote analysts jobs from another country."
JikLVP9DkPs,"Such a chilled Channel - Sweet Potatoes. Couldn't hear you sip. Maybe your Mic is Uni-directional or You have an awesome silent-coffee-sipping skill. :)

Ambivert was the word you were looking for (Intro- and Extrovert)"
JikLVP9DkPs,The job hunt has been quite frustrating I feel like more often than not the job posts I see are of the unrealistic variety. Especially the “entry” level positions. I’m just wondering how do you even pin one of these positions down? It’s always such a downer seeing 200+ applicants.
JikLVP9DkPs,I'm really having a hard time finding an entry level job. Any tips on finding a recruiter?
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes
JikLVP9DkPs,Watching you talk so much about potatoes kind of made me hungry -_-
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hey Alex nothing wrong with being in appreciation mode. We appreciate YOU and your videos! Btw, I noticed the first few jobs you showed have requirements of bachelors in computer science or related fields. Can you speak on the job prospects for people who have undergrad degrees in social sciences like myself and other non-quantitative fields?"
JikLVP9DkPs,hope i will get  a job in 2 months after completing my training
JikLVP9DkPs,potatoes !!! <3
JikLVP9DkPs,🥔 Potato's. Question. Currently you work in a non data analyst related job but  you attended trainings or boot camp to be a data analyst. What are advantages or pitfalls if you applied for an internal job hiring for a data analyst in the company you  work for.
JikLVP9DkPs,"I gotta say that I have been ingesting your videos  this weekend more than my Udemy courses on Excel over this long weekend. I'm super glad that I have found your channel, and i'm sure that when my time comes to graduate my bootcamp (I know, i know,) I will have garnered so much information to successfully land my first data job! Thank you so much for being here. Sweet potatoes and steak for dinner BTW!"
JikLVP9DkPs,In python we have to know the libraries of python like pandas or other  normal python .
JikLVP9DkPs,How about summer internships!
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes...
JikLVP9DkPs,"Great Video Alex couldn't hear any sips while you recorded, I'm in a place where I'm currently transitioning into a career in data analytics and I've found your videos quite helpful. I would love to your take on looking for remote jobs as I'm from Nigeria and currently living here as well.

Potatoes - I love fries and roasted sweet potateas."
JikLVP9DkPs,I keep having to check my phone as I'm listening bc I keep thinking my video is paused but it's just you drinking coffee lol
JikLVP9DkPs,"Potatoes 🥔!!! 

Btw, didn’t hear you drinking coffee 🤣"
JikLVP9DkPs,🙏
JikLVP9DkPs,🥔🍟🙏
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hey Alex when it's required to have Python knowledge, does that mean I have to know Python from A-Z or have to know only things that are related to data analysis??"
JikLVP9DkPs,So what are the common languages one must learn to be a Data Analyst? I been seeing SQL of course and Python and Excell
JikLVP9DkPs,Great show. I couldn't hear you drinking the coffee at all.
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hi Alex is there a way to get in touch with you directly, LinkedIn et al? I need some guidance and mentorship in these times. I have direct experience of 7 years but can't land anything after trying for 8 months not even an interview. I'm confused and stressed out and refuse to believe that it's my skillset. I need guidance and would appreciate your help if your time. Permits."
JikLVP9DkPs,"Potato! 🥔 Thanks for doing this video on this topic. It's hard to find realistic job postings for a data analyst. Hopefully I can find one in my area(or a remote one) because most of the ones I find are like the ones you had on your last video(unrealistic DA job postings).
Btw, couldn't hear you drink coffee and even if I could hear you I wouldn't make mind one bit. If you the coffee, drink as much as you can. Thanks again fellow ambivert!!"
JikLVP9DkPs,The second example is what companies need to do more of. Going out of the way to show the skills you actually need and the ones they’re willing to teach you is huge.
JikLVP9DkPs,"I'm eight months into a career restart as a Data Analyst, and this was great. I literally got hired on ""Can you do SQL joins? We can't get anyone who can do SQL joins."""
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hello everybody! I know this is probably not the right place to ask but... I'm trying to do the so dreamed ""career change"", so I'm learning everything I can about data analysis. Today I got a 1 year licence for Alteryx so I'm wondering if is worth to give it a try, or is something data analyst don't need.  
PS: I already know Python and R, basics of SQL and Tableau."
JikLVP9DkPs,🥔🥔🍟 another great video. I couldn't hear the coffee .
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes protect us from invading armies!
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes!
JikLVP9DkPs,"Drink as much coffee as you want during recording, couldn't hear it at all! 

""Po-Ta-Toes!?! Boil 'em, Mash 'em, Stick 'em in a stew!"""
JikLVP9DkPs,"This video gave me so much hope. YOU give me so much hope. I almost flinched when you said ""potatoes"". I went on the potato diet once and almost died. I'm glad I didn't die because you're making it worth while :)"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes. Hi Alex. What keywords do you use to best search for these awesome roles. 🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔
JikLVP9DkPs,Data cleaning tutorial plsss
JikLVP9DkPs,MASHED POTATOES IS THE WAY TO GO!
JikLVP9DkPs,Is it possible to find part-time data analyst positions in evening/weekend hours? Or are they typically normal business hours?
JikLVP9DkPs,potatoes
JikLVP9DkPs,"Thanks for showing us realistic job description that don't give us a cardiac arrest! However I noticed for most of the jobs you showed, there over were 200 applicants and I'm guessing that this is the main reason why ridiculous job descriptions are made in the first place. Is this something worth our attention on Linkedin? 🥔 🥔 🥔  and, no I couldn't hear you sipping coffee from your cup"
JikLVP9DkPs,Make a video on how to find summer internship in data analytics.
JikLVP9DkPs,Hey Alex please do a job review video like this from the F.A.N.G. companies.
JikLVP9DkPs,Before I eat my potatoes tomorrow I will give thanks for the Alex the analyst videos
JikLVP9DkPs,"Can’t hear you drink the coffee, but potato!!"
JikLVP9DkPs,Hey Alex are you a Marvel or DC fan ?
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes
JikLVP9DkPs,🥔... this is a very great video on job search and I enjoyed it.
JikLVP9DkPs,"🥔 🍟
I wonder when we're going to run out of veggies 😂

Nice having coffee ☕ with you this morning! 
I couldn't hear you drink, but some people are into that sort of thing, ASMR coffee time would be a hit  if they could hear you 😂
And these good job postings gave me my hope back after the bad job postings video 😂 as a fellow introvert, it's not that we can't socialize..my understanding is that we need time alone to recharge from socializing..as opposed to extroverts who get their energy from others .

That makes me curious though, what's the corporate culture like in data analytics? My last job was full of ""get it in writing"" people who would email me from 5 feet away to ask me to do something 🤦‍♂️"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potato yo!
JikLVP9DkPs,"Thanks for the video, it was great to see what a good post looks like.

Also, don’t forget everyone has a favorite potato!"
JikLVP9DkPs,Potatoes
JikLVP9DkPs,"Hey Alex, how you doing? You channel helped me a lot. I wish you 20k before the end of the year. And the vegetabel of the week is 🥔🥔 potato"
JikLVP9DkPs,I have applied for soo many jobs but I didn't get any interview calls .

yzqpYs7dIqY,"I think hiring staff at companies would be better off if they saw one particular scene from the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"". It was about famous Mathematician John Nash.

There was a scene where Nash and his college buddies were at a bar and there were several women. But there was 1 blonde lady there that they all were drooling over. Nash pointed out that if they ALL went for her they would all lose. And then if they followed that up by going after her friends they would give them the cold shoulder for being the ""second option"". But if they sacrificed getting ""the best option"" to get the ""good enough option"" they would all have an equal chance at going home with a woman.

The moral of the story is this: bring your expectations down to reality. Maybe don't shoot for the top 5 or 10%. Try shooting for the top 35%? If necessary, get more people to look over your online application submissions in order to properly assess what talent you have. Plus, corporate America already has a pretty bad stink of treating the people behind the applications (and their employees) as numbers rather than people.

And if corpo america doesn't want that...maybe just hire whoever they can find locally. Have your employees do prebono work to find your applicants at local universities. Pester the students to apply. Go back to printing ads in the paper or something like that."
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets. :) Much appreciate the insight - even post-COVID.
yzqpYs7dIqY,coffee time with Alex sounds awesome!
yzqpYs7dIqY,beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"BEETS!

I really appreciate you, man. It might be 3 years after posting this video that I'm watching now, but I'm seriously touched by your efforts to help aspiring data analysts like me to break into data. I've watched a lot of your videos from SQL, Power BI, and Excel tutorials from when I was just learning, up to these videos on job seeking advice as I am applying now.

Just as we say it in the Philippines, PADAYON to you!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Hi Alex, although it’s been two years for the video I must say I feel like the number of unrealistic job postings have increased, I was just going through job descriptions like this , do you think for entry level data analyst, is it a good idea to apply for jobs that have atleast around half the qualifications mentioned matching to our skill set?"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"They always write many skills you must have for their vacancies and at the end they write ""ready to take a student"". And when you write them with you experienced cv, they silent cause they want to take a student.😕"
yzqpYs7dIqY,This episode beets all others.
yzqpYs7dIqY,These typa job descriptions are discouraging good to know these are just unrealistic and red flag
yzqpYs7dIqY,Hot chocolate is a better option than coffee. Coffee at night means goodbye to sound sleep and hello *jitters*
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets! Love you Alex hope you reach 1 million subs.
yzqpYs7dIqY,BEETS
yzqpYs7dIqY,This is why I and millions of others get discouraged in tech. Companies want basically slave labor. They want you to be over qualified and pay you entry level bare minimum salary for it. The entire tech industry is screwed up beyond belief.
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets. Alex keep it up man. I would love coffee time with Alex.
yzqpYs7dIqY,I thought DA jobs are in demand in this decade? How come that its still like this on the job market? DA are supposed to be scarce right?
yzqpYs7dIqY,beets :v
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets babyyy beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,What they're asking for is experienced DA at junior pay. 😂  How I wish employers watch this video!
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Thanks Alex, I needed this video.  I know it was posted a year ago and you may not see this but I’m currently trying to figure all this out  and I’ve been binging these videos.  But this one in particular was helpful.  I see these junior posts and just keep adding things I need to learn and putting more on my plate than necessary to land that junior role.

The last key words were mushroom, celery and beets 😂"

yzqpYs7dIqY,"Okay, but hear me out. Garden fresh beet salad. Bit of citrus? Incredible."
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Maybe a bit nit-picky on my part, but it drives me CRAZY when recruiters/hiring managers cannot post the job ad properly.  Big things are: spelling mistakes on basic words (""Bachalors""), inconsistent details (hiring for junior, yet listing mid-senior) and above all, NOT knowing what a Data Analyst does.

They hold applicants to a very high standard, yet cannot bother to proof-read their own job ad.  It drives me absolutely bonkers!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Back when I lived in DC doing contract work a security clearance was a highly valued and prized credential.  Back then they were hard to come by and get.  I had heard through the grape vine that a lot of former military people with these credentials didn't realize how much they could command and were routinely underpaid.  I'm curious if that is sill the case and why you see ridiculous job ads like you posted.  I also work in the Salesforce space, anything with one or more certifications usually start around $80K.  I'm a little confused about ""Beets"" and ""Beats"" but wanted to include both to be safe :)"
yzqpYs7dIqY,BEETS
yzqpYs7dIqY,"You doing the Lord’s work, haha.  Thanks for all you do.  I swear some of these jobs are looking for a data scientist instead of a data analyst.  But they want to pay you for the analyst level haha.  

Yeah...I would probably be the same way with the air force ICBM job.  Tell my family goodbye and that I am going work with the aliens 👽 now 😂"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Great video, some of these companies are crazy."
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Beets!

This was very insightful for when I strat looking for my first Data Analytics jobs, hoepfully you already did the one where you look at good job postings.

Thanks for everything and the effort!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"HI Alex thanks for the video, I am entery level data analyst and while sending CV-s on entery level Data Analys I always get a proble mthat I do not have a experience. And I get a questio n how should I have an experience if I do not work? :D"
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets!
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Even if you think the requirements are overwhelming and unrealistic still apply (might as well). A job where I used to work was advertised, on the advert it said applications would end by .... due to anticipated large number of applicants. The person who got the job turned out to be the only applicant! I’ve also had jobs where the unrealistic requirements versus the reality of the job were quite different, the advert was intimidating but the job was nothing special."

yzqpYs7dIqY,"10 months later but this topic is still very important:
 
On this topic, I’m surprised you found 7 like this out of 30.
over the past month I look at 50+ jobs and found exactly one that is reasonable. Out of these 50, I tried to apply to 22 of them. Of those 22 only one reached out - I bet you can guess which one. 

Good on you to plug in the monitor.

Next up, I’ll be watching the good postings.

yzqpYs7dIqY,"Hey just noticed the same issue in my country with reference to the Data Analyst role being a mix with Data Engineer. Was wondering if you think its a good idea to do the ""IBM Data Engineering Certification"" to get an idea. 

Courses Im currently doing and waiting to get certification and progressing sequentially from 1 - 3,

1.Google Data Analytics Certificate - (SQL and Tableau) 
2.Tableau Data Analyst Certification - (Tableau)
3.Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate (PowerBI)

Would the ""IBM Data Engineering Certificate"" be too much, What do you think?

I'm currently trying to transition into a Data Analyst role (I have a Masters all-ready in a field called Econometrics + 6 years experience in Economics Research)

P.S. Sorry for the long question just really intrigued and feel comfortable asking you this question?"
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Thank you for this video. Well, it really gives me confidence the things companies demand from an entry-level job, are unrealistic. And coming from you who is a professional himself and knows how things work, gives me an assurance that I am not wrong and also not settling for less."
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets!
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Obviously the use of that baby monitor will disqualify you for any high level security clearance. You probably have plenty of bears running around your stuff already...Cozy, Fancy, etc, etc. As for beets, identity theft is not a joke jim..."

yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"I was so excited and full of confidence from watching your videos...then I looked up job opportunities in my area and totally lost every bit of confidence.  It was intimidating and most of them didn't make sense, such as some didn't have job descriptions, others wanted you to have an accounting degree, and some jobs expect you to also be the IT person! Great Video! Beets!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,Thanks for this video. I just completed my masters and I’m on the look for a job and the majority of jobs have those descriptions which is disheartening! Your words are encouraging. Beets!
yzqpYs7dIqY,"These government related jobs have these unrealistic requirements because they're trying to be ""lowest bidder"". Gov't contracts have heavy requirements in their contracts and contractors are trying to put in a size 13 foot into a size 10 shoe in order to be selected or awarded the contract."
yzqpYs7dIqY,BEETS!
yzqpYs7dIqY,Data analyst at McDonald’s lol
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets! I actually like beets(vegetable)
yzqpYs7dIqY,Can not do this comparison with out talking about salary. Junior is a flexible term.
yzqpYs7dIqY,Entry level job with minimum 5 years of experience oh and by the way we’re gonna pay you $40K a year
yzqpYs7dIqY,This comes down to money employers do not want to spend money on mid to senior level positions they want to pay someone on junior or entry level positions to save cost. The average senior in their field medical science it earns 80k to 100K Plus an employer just don't want to pay that they want to pay $35 to 70 before taxes
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"The KGS job description spelled ""bachelor's"" wrong.  -_-"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Funny thing, the third job posting (the one by the National Capitol Contracting and requiring a security clearance) actually has ""Mid-Senior Level"" in Job Details. Maybe whoever posted the job was just too busy eating beets and copy pasted a description from the wrong job posting template.

Also, ""hot chocolate with Alex"" sounds wonderful! Well, it already sounds wonderful after the first two words :D"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"I'm looking at one right now... ""Minimum of master’s degree in public administration, public health, early childhood education or other education or human services degree, AND four years of project management experience preferably in a health or early education/education system at the state or federal level, OR equivalent combination of training and experience.""
Hiring Range: $52,978 - 66,223
BA's and DA jobs in Raleigh seem to be underpaid."
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Beets! Alex, could you make the video of data analysts vs. market analyst when you have a chance."
yzqpYs7dIqY,"I graduated college 5 years ago, not in analytic, but honestly, if I didn't get my first job through college recruitment where employers know exactly what type of applicants they will get, I think I would still be living in my parents basements. Even outside of data analyst all jobs qualifications for entry level are freaking insane. Here is a job that will pay you $40k a year, what's that? You didn't solve world hunger? How about the unpaid internship with an office next to the trash compactor sound?"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"MDM = master data management 
Basically insure data integrity and no duplication"
yzqpYs7dIqY,So what are Database Administrators and Database Developers? 🤔
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Alex, did you notice that for those unrealistic jobs had over 200 applicants? unrealistic applications aswell"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"If I have to read another job posting that says ""Entry Level"" 10 years exp needed I'm yeeting my PC out the window"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Beets! haha! 

It's almost the same in Europe! I am in Ireland and seeing these requirements absolutely demoralizes you. But I am glad you put this up and it helps me believe in myself a bit more knowing that I don;t need to go out of my way to learn advanced concepts just to apply for entry level and graduate roles. Thanks, Alex! This means so much. Will now watch your video on the realistic jobs!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,identity theft is not a joke Alex
yzqpYs7dIqY,Do a video on some good job postings on LinkedIn and glassdoor..it will really help me
yzqpYs7dIqY,I really love the show. I'm currently a sophomore in college and your videos have me motivated in pursuing this career.
yzqpYs7dIqY,I feel that most of the descriptions are purely HR written. Sometimes I have had job interviews by phone by HR people and they start talking about this tools and what do you do with them. When you start responding you quickly realize you are talking with someone that's just reading from a piece of paper and marking checks depending if you mentioned a tool or not. The problem is that they just leave these position writing to HR and don't even care to check if what they wrote makes sense or not
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Thanks for the video Alex. As a reporting analyst looking for a job, I get mini anxiety attacks after looking at “unrealistic” requirements. I actually get confused and start doubting myself. 

Your videos are really helpful Alex. Thank you 😊.

Also, How do I connect with you on LinkedIn?"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Beets...don't think I will ever like them. That aside, great video! This has been a pet peeve of mine, and this is the first time I have seen someone call out these ridiculous job postings/requirements. Shouldn't HR be in alignment with the department/job area needing the position filled to put together what they are looking for? No wonder I see the same jobs for months on end not being filled...unrealistic and ridiculous expectations. A curious mind and enthusiasm should be a starter, along with a few other (realistic) tools at the junior and entry level. Enjoy you man!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,How can I practice the logics behind the particular problems...!!
yzqpYs7dIqY,this is a supper interesting topic and informative!! Thank you
yzqpYs7dIqY,beets 🤣
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Heyy Alex!

I love what you post and have helped me a lot in defining my career path. Just a suggestion - Could you please make a video on best analytic companies to target to jumpstart your career and maybe a few pointers on how one can land a job there.

Cheers and keep up the amazing work! ❤🔥🔥"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Junior level positions now needs senior level education.
Alex, where to go now🤣"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Good show Alex, keep going, see you next week with some coffee.  beets"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Enjoyed this, encouraging to us newbies who can get overwhelmed with so called entry level requirements. 
One thing I would say on the 2-7 year requirement one, maybe they are saying if you have 10 years experience you're over qualified. I used to work as a recruiter and you'd often get people apply for a basic  role with way too many years of experience, simply because they're desperate for work. They'd jump on to another role 6 months down the line once the market improves."
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Hi Alex,

I am currently learning the Matplot lib and seaborn libraries in python for data visualization and this finds a bit difficult for me to learn  .I have already learnt the data visualization tool Tableau is it necessary to learn these libraries still?"
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets!
yzqpYs7dIqY,Can you please do the video for good positions available?
yzqpYs7dIqY,Do you think based on your experience is Data Analyst or Data Scientist a good career for introverts? 👉👈
yzqpYs7dIqY,Sir is any job like esports anlyst after completing data anlyst or science...my dream job is work for any esports game compny and join as anlyst..
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Let's be honest comment section, we are all here for the vegetable based puns. It clearly beets any other segment of the show"
yzqpYs7dIqY,Does DA need to be fluent in math?
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Hi Alex,
Please make a video on some real time project of data analyst"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Recruiters don't know crap about anything technical. It's a disaster when these talking heads need to deal with anything mildly technical, including working out who does what, and what makes a good technical candidate. Unless they used to work in these fields. Sales people are useless."
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Beets! Great video :) I found you on reddit a few months (or more? 2020 is a blur!) ago really appreciate your content.  I'm happy to see your channel growing so much recently, you deserve it!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,Would you mind doing some projects on data analytics ASAP
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Beets!  Great info, as usual, Alex!"
yzqpYs7dIqY,some delusional HRs...
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets. Great video. Thanks for posting. This video hits me right where I am. Looking forward to the video on actually job descriptions. And get some sleep. You don't want a heart attack like I had...from lack of sleep. It eventually causes your body to haywire. God bless you.
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"These people posting these ads don't even know what they are talking about.
Linkedin should allow users to report these kinds of unrealistic posts."
yzqpYs7dIqY,Beets
yzqpYs7dIqY,"I feel like the HR people who write these just close their eyes with one hand, and press buttons on the keyboard with the other to determine the years of experience required for these Jr. Data Analyst jobs lol"
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Hey Alex,
as someone who just finished Udemy's SQL Bootcamp and is on her way to become a data analyst within the music industry, I would like to thank you for this video. I plan to just apply to my first Data Analyst position and all the job postings started to freak me out. You managed to ease some of my anxiety in this regard. :)

I'm going to be yet again a bringer of weird taste combinations: instead of coffee, I would recommend to bring in chocolate-beets (!) cookies to the show. This is the closest recipe I could find to the original Hungarian version: https://www.thespruceeats.com/chocolate-beet-cake-recipe-1807141 
They are amazingly tasty and way healthier in the middle of the night than coffee ;) I hope you'll give them a try."
yzqpYs7dIqY,"Here are my two cents on this, this entire situation is completely ridicules! and I think companies and HR specifically is going to create a nightmare of scenario in 1 - 2 years time because they will need to rehire so many people and fast... and it will cost a lot of money to the companies.  People who are senior and have no other choice but to take these positions will be unhappy. They will feel that their were screwed over by companies who took advantage of the pandemic, and in turn will be the first to jump ship when the recovery will start. I assume recovery, specifically in the Data Analytics world will have a lot of demand as companies will need to process insane amount of data and fast. So instead of having a junior employee that will be with his natural career progression for about 2 - 4 years... employers will get unhappy staff that will change jobs in a heart beat for more money, again I assume would be around 6 - 12 months for good senior analysts. I backup my assumption by vaccines success rate and overall stock exchange recovery. 

***disclaimer - I'm currently finishing my data analyst courses (SQL, Excel, Python and Power BI) and trying to make a career change during all of this pandemic. 41 days to this wonderful year to go! whoohooo.... begone already! 😅"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hi Alex, It's unbelievable...Just 2 days back I had updated the skills in my linkedin profile as you had suggested in this video, to align to a Data Analyst profile. It's as though you read my mind or rather I read your mind ☺️. Thanks for the other tips regarding the recruiter and referrals. A big thanks for all your efforts 👍"
7uH7_DThtX0,Very helpful thank you
7uH7_DThtX0,This works 💯
7uH7_DThtX0,"Help me Sir am in UGA but I applied for a job with in LinkedIn process about no any response from that 
Help me with that 🙏"
7uH7_DThtX0,Question… in regards to reaching out to the company recruiter and an employee for referral - would you do this one after another immediately or space it out a couple of days? I don’t want to come off stalker like haha
7uH7_DThtX0,What if I'm looking for a job for someone
7uH7_DThtX0,"Question, is it ok to reach out to recruiters after resume was already sent."
7uH7_DThtX0,I have never been able to get a job via Linkedin
7uH7_DThtX0,😂
7uH7_DThtX0,I don’t have that option of putting that info in for a recruiter
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hi Alex, I just watched it today, and it was really helpful—thank you! However, I’m still encountering some challenges when submitting my applications to certain companies. After entering all my details, I don’t see the submit button or command at the end.

Could you help me figure out what might be causing this issue, if you don’t mind?"

To further enhance my resume, I’ve been utilizing tools like Jobsolv and other similar platforms, which help tailor my resume and connect with potential employers."

7uH7_DThtX0,ty
7uH7_DThtX0,Vry.Informative nd outstanding tips.Thanx for your innovative ideas.Appreciated your point of view.👍
7uH7_DThtX0,I’ve been looking for a job for 2 years now. I’m going to use LinkedIn and follow these tips. Thanks!
7uH7_DThtX0,You are awesome Alex. Your videos are thorough and so helpful. Best data analyst guru 🙏🏽
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hey Professor Alex, my brother is looking for a graphic design job, but he has limited time on his OPT—just one month left—and he's not receiving any responses. We’re feeling frustrated. He has everything ready, including a strong resume, cover letter, portfolio, and has reached out to HR. It’s a critical time for his visa status. He’s really talented, but he needs help with connections. I think you would be a great person to discuss this with. Let me know if you’re available!😢❤"
7uH7_DThtX0,"2:54 - ""There is basically no harm in me being a referral for somebody""
False. If the person ends up getting hired and performs terribly - your credibility within the company will drop significantly, if not entirely."
7uH7_DThtX0,"Great Insights Alex, Loved it and very hopeful these strategies will help me land a job in Business Analyst"
7uH7_DThtX0,Thanks a lot for your video!👍
7uH7_DThtX0,Thanks a lot for your video!!
7uH7_DThtX0,How many jobs can I apply per day via LinkedIn (Maximum)?
7uH7_DThtX0,Thank you. I am building my LinkedIn profile. I found out that your tips are supportive so I left my comment here ❤️
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hi alex, your videos are great and extremely useful,  but nowadays almost all conpanies have an automated notice  saying they  don't want applicants to reach them via messages, as this slow their hiring process, do you recommend to just ignore it and keep reaching them, or is it better not to?"
7uH7_DThtX0,"I’ve had more success using Jobsolv for finding jobs. They give suggestions based on your skills and experience, and it even auto-tailors your resume for each job. It’s a lot cheaper than paying for a recruiting service. Plus, you stay in control of your job search, which is great if you prefer doing things yourself."
7uH7_DThtX0,Recruiters don't reply back. So.....
7uH7_DThtX0,Good info Sir.
7uH7_DThtX0,One of the best videos I reviewed for seeking my next career move!
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hi Alex, i find this video extremely helpful. Thank you, God bless you.

Please i'd love for you to mentor me in my career growth"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Alex, this is by far the most precise, helpful video I have seen on how to use LinkedIn to land a job. Thank you for making it."
7uH7_DThtX0,Somebody should write a web browser plugin that blocks humble brag nonsense. I am so tired of LinkedIn being turned into a little manipulative teenagers diary.
7uH7_DThtX0,Thank you Alex for the video. It is most helpful. I think recommendation system is a huge leverage to get the job you want ☺.
7uH7_DThtX0,"LinkedIn useful.
Total 4 times I switcched job but unlucky from LinkedIn not received any offer.

LinkedIn works only for few people.😬

But maybe in future the big offer will come🙂"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Outstanding tips, Alex! Much obliged!"
7uH7_DThtX0,Thanks
7uH7_DThtX0,Yeah stalking the recruiter on LinkedIn is a terrible idea. You look like a desperate weirdo
7uH7_DThtX0,"What a coincidence, I am also sesrching for the data analyst job at Chicago."
7uH7_DThtX0,"Laid off in November. I think my resume is pretty good and I tailor it for different roles. Very few interviews and contacts compared to times I looked for work prior, frustrated. Thanks so mcuh for these tips."
7uH7_DThtX0,"Great strategies, Alex - I love your proactive approach."
7uH7_DThtX0,"While setting the view of ""en to work"" for recruiters only, wouldn't my present company's recruiters also see it? Doesn't it put my present job in danger?"
7uH7_DThtX0,What terrible ideas.
7uH7_DThtX0,Hi Alex! Thanks for such an amazing content. It was very difficult for me to find a job when I was a student but luckily I followed some of the strategies similar to the ones you explained. Contacting and connecting was challenging especially when crafting a connect note but I used an AI tool called ConnectGenie AI which made this work completely effortlessly for me. I thought i would share it in case if anyone else is struggling :)
7uH7_DThtX0,">that banner at 4:02

7uH7_DThtX0,"6:18 0.04 success rate would mean 40 per 1000, no? Or, if you're talking %, 0.4 per 1000?"
7uH7_DThtX0,"hey Alex, nice videos"
7uH7_DThtX0,Thanks for another amazing video! I wish I had found your channel sooner!
7uH7_DThtX0,4:00 the 'Please Hire Me' message killed me 😂😂😂
7uH7_DThtX0,"Thanks, really appreciate it."
7uH7_DThtX0,Hello Alex. I want to sincerely thank you for this Bootcamp. I secured a better job after taking this Bootcamp. Thank you ALex.
7uH7_DThtX0,Thank you Alex this video is very interesting and useful.
7uH7_DThtX0,thanks a bounch
7uH7_DThtX0,Found it
7uH7_DThtX0,I often find I can't message someone on LinkedIn because they're outside of my network and LinkedIn premium is so extortionate I can't justify paying for it while I'm looking for a job!
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hey Alex, really appreciate you taking the time out to share these valuable tips with us fellow job seekers. New subscriber here to your channel!  When someone agrees to be a referral who already works at the company, can you explain in more detail how to then use that referral when you apply for a job at the company?"
7uH7_DThtX0,Great Alex...your video is a great help.Actually I was looking for such suggestions. Big help..big thanks
7uH7_DThtX0,Do you lie? Just saying who does.. although creeping through a comb of background some dont do... but .. sadly to say some Genius somewhere is not using Linkedin
7uH7_DThtX0,nice tips Alex...!
7uH7_DThtX0,"0.04 of a 1000 is 40, not 4 :)"
7uH7_DThtX0,"i have a quick question, what is the best app for screen recording, and what app do you use for ur vides"
7uH7_DThtX0,"If 100s of people start sending private messages to recruiters and the existing staff in that company, won't this really irritate them?? Having said this, Is it ethically correct to do this?"
7uH7_DThtX0,thank you  Alex
7uH7_DThtX0,nice video
7uH7_DThtX0,"Study, practice, study, practice, etc., etc., work your tail off, then realize you'll probably never even get an interview for a DA position.  The jobs are few and the pool is wide."
7uH7_DThtX0,Hi Alex thank you for info I need ask if I need international job dlis it right to pay recruiter and consultant company before getting a job
7uH7_DThtX0,Please hire me - looks like fu*ING go begging
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hello Alex,
I appreciate your valuable input. 
Typically, entry-level data analyst positions often demand around 2-3 years of relevant work experience. However, when it comes to including open data projects in my portfolio/resume, it becomes challenging to quantify their impact since actionable steps cannot be taken based on the insights. How should I approach this situation?"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Very good tips, thank you!!!"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Great information, thanks for the insight!"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Thank you Mr. Alex you are my favourite YouTuber, all your contents are very helpful"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hi alex , thank you so much. i finish your bootcamp courses today, it took me about 3 weeks.
imma updated my comment after landed my first job as data analyst"
7uH7_DThtX0,"Many recruiters have zero clue about any aspects of a technical job. Basically, they just want to hear buzzwords to tick the box."
7uH7_DThtX0,Thanks Alex! Also you can Chat GBT to generate eloquent referral messages for you 👍🏻
7uH7_DThtX0,"Hi Alex, your video was very helpful ."
7uH7_DThtX0,"Please sir can I easily get a job as data analyst in other continents outside Africa 
When I’m located in Africa"
7uH7_DThtX0,Alex you are the kindest soul on the planet for all the effort you put into making these videos to help others on the internet get jobs and become financially stable 🙏😭💕
7uH7_DThtX0,LinikedIn has its own system for creating a resume automatically based on your profile. LinkedIn themselves say they build it in a way to get passed all the automated resume checkers most companies use these days. Is this a good resume to use when applying to companies considering that LinkedIn builds it themselves?
7uH7_DThtX0,"Glad I watched your video, I wouldn't consider LinkedIn haven't for years. But I want to find remote work and this might be my best bet lol"
7uH7_DThtX0,Hi Alex. What if the job you do at the moment doesn't have any relation which the job you are applying for?
7uH7_DThtX0,Is it possible to get a remote job as a data analyst because you from Africa
7uH7_DThtX0,Learnt a really good way to find a job. Thank you so much.

I did learn en glish for getting more chances for a job, so I hope it works..."
7uH7_DThtX0,"wow, what usefull information, thank you!"
7uH7_DThtX0,Your tips helped me get my first analyst job! Thanks!
7uH7_DThtX0,"thank you Alex, whit this video you answered my important question that i haved looking for."
7uH7_DThtX0,Can a 45 years old person also get a entry level job after learning Power bi basics. No experience no IT Background jobless. Am I wasting the time or still have a hope and opportunities in this field. Please suggest. No friends circle no community. Your guidance would be helpful to me. Thanks.
7uH7_DThtX0,"i struggle to determine why i want to help a big company make even more money, alex. could you put out a video about nonprofits, small businesses (!!!!)?

i want your advice about applying my mind (because that is what data analytics most requires) to other areas of life, outside of corporations."
7uH7_DThtX0,"Its so great to finally see this video. I had this saved for a while and I have been following and watching your other videos so I went to linkedin to follow you and ended accidentally trying to connect with this fake account. I was scared it was a scammer or something. haha Glad to know you were just using it as a dummy profile. Anyways, I have followed your tips and added an Excel badge today. I hope I  am able to find a job soon!"
7uH7_DThtX0,"This was incredibly helpful. Thanks, Alex! 😊"

GGLF2jLo8J4,"Hi Alex!

Just stumbled upon your channel a few weeks back and am currently binging the videos while working. Say, would you consider Alteryx to be a no-code analytics tool? Because it seems to kind of fit the description, and for one thing I can tell that some big-name audit companies do use it to allow not very tech-savvy employees to handle client's data (including fairly big data). The data's often pretty clean (not always, sometimes it's quite a hassle), but there's still a lot of ETL going on and even rather complex workflows are built in Alteryx before potentially being handed over to a more advanced analytics/development team if needed.

Can be quite useful when preparing data on rudabega sales for further analysis ;)"

GGLF2jLo8J4,"Can you tell me if these traits/personality qualities make Data Analyst a good or bad match? For those interested, this is theoretical mumbo jumbo of MBTI's INFJ personality type. IEI and Te-PolR are in reference to me:

IEI: I make lots of little factual errors, don't focus on the little details unless absolutely forced to. I don't care about doing things ""the best way"" unless it's something I really care about. If it's something I really care about, I will slave over it (not Te-polr related, just explaining), and be meticulous and obsessive and perfectionist. If it's something I don't care about, I will literally do a way that takes longer and wastes time and doesn't do the job as well just for the sake of not having to focus on it. I am *so* indifferent to ""optimization"" (that's a Te buzzword).

Te-PoLR have trouble dealing with things in a detached and rational manner. They have trouble focusing on work and tend to have trouble doing things the way things are ""supposed"" to be done, often doing things in a way that is most emotionally stimulating which can be perceived as wasteful of time or resources. They fear that they won't meet objective expectations or that they will be forced to do so.

Te-polr have problems trusting information they're given. They are unlikely to trust unreliable sources of information and make a determination based on anything but personal experience or vision. I've found that often IEI like to have some (what they feel to be reliable) reference material which they will consult when doing something, but often have problems doing research outside of that. They're often quite skeptical of reasonable reliable sources of information that some people find ok. They need someone to explain it to them or someone to do it and prove it in front of them, then they will have some trust of that information."

GGLF2jLo8J4,"Rudibega. I was in the school spelling bee in elementary school, so I know what I'm doing."
GGLF2jLo8J4,"plot twist: the  real story is it was a cub and it was chewing on a sandal 20 ft away and they were in a camper.

Either way, great story and I don't even know if I've ever seen a rutabaga."
GGLF2jLo8J4,"I want to be a data analyst as I listen to you. Because I don't like coding, I like data."
GGLF2jLo8J4,"What is marketing analytics?
Miss this rutubaga"
GGLF2jLo8J4,"sorry to say this ,,,in this video u u look like ur disturbed or in some hurry...is it any?"
GGLF2jLo8J4,what is digital business analysis
GGLF2jLo8J4,Hi Alex!  Can you do one about Digital Analytics VS Data Analytics?  My understanding is digital analytics is closely related to marketing and online consumer behavior.
GGLF2jLo8J4,Rutabaga yo! I agree with you 100% of what you said about today's video. CTO don't know how to code made me 😂.
GGLF2jLo8J4,Rudavega

GGLF2jLo8J4,Rudabega
GGLF2jLo8J4,"please alex , how can  i contact with you ?"
GGLF2jLo8J4,"I knew you were going to say rutabaga. 😂 (Full disclosure, I did look up how to spell it because it was autocorrecting to “rude behavior.” I couldn’t have you thinking I was calling you a brat.)

Good episode. Thanks for your thoughts on the new No Code Analytics apps."
GGLF2jLo8J4,Rutabaga

GGLF2jLo8J4,I didn't find the advertisement..
GGLF2jLo8J4,"Hi Alex, I have a quick question. I have a business analyst case study for a skill interview and I need some help. Do you know anyone who can work on small paid projects?"
GGLF2jLo8J4,"Great Video! Are you familiar with any websites which provide daily tasks for practice (Tableau, Excel Functions, SQL)?"

BGBXnNvWdQ4,I love you Alex. Great video
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Would you mind clarifying why did you use 'a.name' or 'b.id'?

Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us."
BGBXnNvWdQ4,Hy Alex!  Can you try some questions/projects off stratscratch?
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Excellent content, very easy to grasp"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,You look like Bezos Amazon.
BGBXnNvWdQ4,I am learning a lotttttt from your vids can you make a SQL DBA roadmap? I know you are a data analyst and have a background in data science but can you help me I really like to work with tables and SQL queries but I do not know the road map of a DBA and in the future can you make more project-base videos like the ones in the portfolio playlist i was able to learn a lottttt from them tnx a lottt and keep going
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"That's an amazing and useful website that I've never heard about. There are a ton of exercises. Thanks a lot, alex."
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Thank you so much for uploading this! I'm applying to entry level data analyst roles and improving my SQL skills, so this is perfect for me!"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,@Alex kindly release hard part of sql series
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Alex, these digestible and working-level live SQL problem solving video is super helpful!! Keep up the good work!"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"this is the best!! 

but next time, can you make ur face smaller ? 
lol"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Hey I am a fresh grad just find out your channel. Just got out of university with a stat and econ major during the pandemic. When I was in the job search, I found that lots of skills required for junior level data analyst were not taught in school. I have only worked with R using tidyverse + ggplot2. But python definitely have a edge over R in real life work. After watching your videos, I am much more confident that if I switch to python with panda + tableau/power Bi, I will eventually get DA position to start my career. Please keep doing more videos! I love your insights about DA, and they’re super helpful for those of us with a statistics degree but don’t have skills to meet the DA job requirements. Thank you."
BGBXnNvWdQ4,THANK YOU SIR..
BGBXnNvWdQ4,Need more content like this 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Alex, which country?"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,Please make a video on how to make SQL reports on excel
BGBXnNvWdQ4,You Provide Real Value!
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Hi Alex. A very very big thanks to you from my side I have learnt python and am very confused in choosing the correct path using python to work with like is it data science field or developer field. At that time only i have seen your video data scientist vs data analyst then i have got the clarity that I should go for data analyst and from then I have been watching every video of yours which is very informative. Thank so much for that 

I have one question for you i have learnt pandas, numpy ,MySQL, tableau for now can I apply for the data analyst jobs on the sites or should I wait till I learn everything like matplotlib,statistics,regular expressions, string manipulation, story telling etc. some other topics please give your valuable suggestion .

Thanks"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,Why do you shoot picture of you with big mouth open in every cover pictures of your videos?
BGBXnNvWdQ4,No vegetables today?  ;(

BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Hey Alex , love the content , do you think you can cover the topic of creating a portfolio for a resume after completing online courses?"
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"I had fun doing it... Thanks Alex you cleared my mind about what I want to. do in my life...
Please do it every week... Don't just stop it after 3rd one...

BGBXnNvWdQ4,These are amazing! Thank you so much for doing this.
BGBXnNvWdQ4,"Hello Alex, should an Economic major become a Data analyst ? my major is economics not data or computer science. should i just try my luck with Economics B.A or learn something like Data analyst after graduating? im really not sure, my goal is to find a stable job with good pay."

PurMLMKNX0I,Great video! much to learn for those who wanted to start a new consulting business in the D&A domain! Thank you!
PurMLMKNX0I,I feel like this video is what seeded the idea of consulting on Alex's mind.  Then this other video https://youtu.be/aofB2t5o2ao?si=FaDTEVjkRK4XrmJ6 is the sequel to this original one.  Consulting is #Goals
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus. This has been one of the best I’ve watched amazing job.

PurMLMKNX0I,"So much useful information in one video
Thanks a ton!

Really like your humility Alex!

P.S. i hate asparagus"
PurMLMKNX0I,"It should say “No-code BI consulting”, not analytics. One only realizes this after 40 minutes of watching the video 😉"
PurMLMKNX0I,<3
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus. Very interesting
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus!! Great interview and advise. Thanks!!
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus!

PurMLMKNX0I,"Awesome video Alex, this was just the thing I was looking for. I am very keen about Analytics Consulting and this video provides such good value to people like us who want to break into this field.
Also, wonderful thing you are doing with this channel, great content. 
Thankyou."
PurMLMKNX0I,"Asparagus!

Im surprised he is 31 years old!, IU feel old and way behind on my carrer now 😓😓😓😓... how old are you alex??

On a more profesional side, it was really nice to listen someone else´s experience, wich is kinda opposite that yours... it gives more pespective on the different paths you can take as a data analyst... I realized actually beeing a data analyst has a lot of different ways to follow, or specilaties."
PurMLMKNX0I,The most useful video I've stumbled across!
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus! Lol
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus! Great interview. John is a very charming and engaging guest with great nuggets. Thanks!
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus
PurMLMKNX0I,"Nice conversation. Also, I believe that he is BI Analyst."
PurMLMKNX0I,"Asparagus - great interview! My takeaway is if you want to be in the consulting business, #1 essential skill is your ability to SELL - thanks both :)"
PurMLMKNX0I,"Saw an asparagus with a flat tire, as I drove by I heard him mutter, ""I should have a spare, I guess."""

PurMLMKNX0I,ASPARAGUS!
PurMLMKNX0I,This guy is spitting pure gold
PurMLMKNX0I,"if he has so much work then now he is in a position to become a employer. Hire some Entry Level guys, train them to take on the new projects. Eventually he will make more money as more work will be coming in and he can safely pay persons especially since covid making everything unsure. He can literally save some lives. He could easily negotiate a contract for more money to pay his entry Level guys. Even Interns hiring two to 3 interns could do him well since he wont have to pay the full entry level fee but still provide for a college student. Eventually hiring full time and raising their pay while negotiating more money for the contracts."
PurMLMKNX0I,asparagus
PurMLMKNX0I,"Personally, I find Linkedin learning courses very shallow compared to other e-learning platforms like coursera"
PurMLMKNX0I,ASPARAGUS!!!!!!

PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus + 🦐 =  😋
PurMLMKNX0I,"Asparagus, great Interview!"
PurMLMKNX0I,Very insightful but also entertaining! I enjoy this video so much! and hope to continue seeing your videos. Unfortunately I have never eat asparagus LOL 😂
PurMLMKNX0I,"Asparagus!

Great video man. Would love to see more around data consulting and freelancing."
PurMLMKNX0I,"Thank you Alex and John for your wisdom and time. To paraphrase Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér, ""What a time to be alive!""

PurMLMKNX0I,"Asparagus. This was awesome, I loved it and thanks"
PurMLMKNX0I,"Hey Alex , how to format an integer in SQL? Example, in the column of Sales it's written 10000 without any comma seperator, Is there any way I can format it so that it would look 10,000 with a comma ? Thank you so much in advance:)"
PurMLMKNX0I,"Hi Alex
I'm an undergrad applied math major. Yesterday I made a vow to myself to create a better life for my family. I will do whatever it takes to become an effective data analyst. I'm a new sub, and I will use your channel and wisdom to gain valuable advice and insights in this career.
To the future.

Edit: Thank You 💪"
PurMLMKNX0I,"Man, I'm about to look into consulting on the side.  First I need to eat some asparagus."
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus!!  LOL  This was a great interview.  I am very excited to get into Data Analysis and just trying to absorb everything that I can about it.
PurMLMKNX0I,Can you do a sample project that shows what goes on in the daily life of a data analyst??
PurMLMKNX0I,"Thanks Alex The Analyst!!!  Great interview!!!  Please get more intresting interviews to help us understand what are the ""real analytic needs"" of medium and small companies ......  were consulting mostly applies as big companies have dedicated teams.  Asparagus ;)"
PurMLMKNX0I,Can you become a data scientist without having a degree?
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus ... but I'm waiting some different content. Advanced and portfolio series :)
PurMLMKNX0I,ASPARAGUS
PurMLMKNX0I,"I love that Alex did John David's verbal crutch with the ""That's really interesting....""

Edit: Asparagus"
PurMLMKNX0I,"Great video again Alex, good idea to invite a guest to speak about consulting. Definitly best channel youtube about Data analytics topics"
PurMLMKNX0I,Can you make a quick review video on applied data science course with python  specialization by university of  Michigan on coursera.
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus
PurMLMKNX0I,asparagus :)
PurMLMKNX0I,"Inspiring interview! Thanks, hope you can invite more people like him."
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus yo!
PurMLMKNX0I,"Informative and insightful as always. However, there's way too many ads man. Reel it back."
PurMLMKNX0I,"Asparagus , love a great entrepreneurship story !"
PurMLMKNX0I,40:57 - haha I need such customers. Having the perfect data an then just being paid for putting charts on top? lol
PurMLMKNX0I,Asparagus
PurMLMKNX0I,Should i start with MySQL first or python ??
PurMLMKNX0I,"Brilliant video as always. Quick question, if I'm completely soulless and just want the industries within data analysis/science that pay most, what would I pick (asking for a soulless friend)"
PurMLMKNX0I,"Very cool talk guys!
I had to google Asparagus 🤣"
PurMLMKNX0I,That's informative and awesome
PurMLMKNX0I,Interesting talk. Asparagas
PurMLMKNX0I,I have done BTech (2018).I have 2 year gap and I'm new at data analytics.i would like to enter in Data analytics field.what should I do and where should I start?
PurMLMKNX0I,"Added to watch later playlist to listen to before the end of the day.
Just a quick question here:
Over the course of building a portfolio project, what are the most common questions that need to be answered in any dataset? Since most of the times, a business background/knowledge is needed to raise the possible issues or even come up with these questions.
I'm not sure if it's covered in your previous interviews, since I haven't gone through all of them."
PurMLMKNX0I,I was thinking about when this would happen - and it happens!
PurMLMKNX0I,"Thanks for having me on the channel Alex! This was a ton of fun and I feel so lucky that I'm the first guest on your channel. Also, I did make this video on my consulting experience: https://youtu.be/sNt4-ULniQ0"
PurMLMKNX0I,Crazy timing! I recently spoke to John for some advice in my career path and now the video. Good stuff as always Alex would love to see more interviews like this in the future. 👍
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thanks for the vid. Can I ask when it comes to SQL are you ever expected to make use of stored procedures? What might be some examples?
pvxNYyJuiqA,How much should I be good at maths to be a data analyst?
pvxNYyJuiqA,Do I need a lot of maths to do data analyst?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"The ATA STEP program for Data Analysts:
S - SQL
T - Tableau
E - Excel
P - Python

(C) ATA Technology Solutions
LOL
i might recommend one more step at the end:
M - Make Millions...amirite??"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, great and clear video once again. Thanks. Would be a great idea to jump straight to full Python knowledge instead of SQL? Data cleansing, web scrapping, good libraries for a lot of business sectors like marketing. It seems Python have it all...."
pvxNYyJuiqA,I am done with all these skills. What should I go next for? Power BI or Machine Learning? (Will be doing sql project side by side as well)
pvxNYyJuiqA,SQL here I come xD
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great video man, it was very detailed 👏🏻"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hey Alex, Hope you are doing good.
I'm from mechanical engineering background & want to learn 
 Excel,SQl and other Software like python, tablue . i don't have Computer science/ IT domain knowledge.
My question is  how to Start to learn These software , suggest basic some course."
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you for providing a great starting point for learning data analysis skills. I am hoping to be offered a position as a metrics analyst here soon and your video provided me the perfect resources.
pvxNYyJuiqA,SQL it is.
pvxNYyJuiqA,"From the video, the order of thing are SQL, Tableau, Excel, and finally Python. But from the order of thing the link--the one on Udemy--Excel is exempted, and replaced with statistics for Data Science. So which is actually first SQL or Statistic for Data Science?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Is R not used widely in Data Analyst compared to Python?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"What could I say, THANK YOUUUUUUUU!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Summary:
1. SQL
2. Tableau
3. Excel
4. Python"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Should i learn Beautifulsoup, dash and plotly ? Are they also necessary!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"is it important to learn exel even if i know pandas numpy,matplolib very very  good?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Glad to hear there are zero math requirements needed.
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you bro .
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hey im looking for an entry level job as a data analyst. Im good at SQL, MS office and tableau, are these skills enough for me to get into this field and what else should i learn?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,The editing is top notch. You get all your points across without forcing the viewers to listen to uh…. ah….. hm…. pauses….. very concise.
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Agreed. I live and breath SQL. Sometimes, NoSQL as well!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,So tableau over Power bi?
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you!!!!
pvxNYyJuiqA,Is data analyst and data science same job roles?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Damm thanks alot your video really goes a long way to clarify what I have been searching for. Just a question, if after getting and mastering all this skills can one apply direct as a data Analyst or is there any other path that has to come first ."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"SQL basics are really easy to grasp, there are so many questions that come from experience that the key skills are developed. Great advice to work on a project, it just really helps people to understand the mechanics rather than just memorizing syntax."
pvxNYyJuiqA,What about r programming??
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you I was looking this type of video.
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great, caring video!  Only partially agree with the author on Tableau though - it is very popular But very industry specific type of tool - mostly in healthcare and hospitality industries"
pvxNYyJuiqA,thanks you very much
pvxNYyJuiqA,Is it relly required to learn Python for data analyst?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"My friend recommended me to learn R instead of Python, but I see many places that recommend Python over R. Am i right to believe that either language is perfectly suitable and is more likely what you perfer? only advantage I am aware of, Python is more machine learning friendly which could be very useful, but you can do that with R as well."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hello Alex, Great content. What's your take on Colt Steele's MySQL course udemy?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"SQL:
Select, from, where, group by, order by, case statement, unions, joins"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Finally found what I was actually searching for days. Thanks YouTube algo and Alex both. 😁😁
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex! I just wanna say your videos are very helpful! The world needs more people like you. I am wondering what kind of expert knowledge would you need to become a data analyst? For example, if you work as a business data analyst but you do not have any background in business, how do you know what data you need to look at and what pattern you need to find? Would really appreciate if you have a video that walks us through from the very beginning (tackling the question, find data, etc)"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great insights for an absolute beginner like me. Without any knowledge of the first two and little of the third, I just started learning Python because of the perception that it will solely land me ajob since it is highly indemand. It still is really hard for a non-programmer like me to fully grasp the concepts.
After watching your videos, I'm surely going to put Python on hold and start to deeply understand SQL and Tableu. 
Thank you for sharing. ❤️"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"In addition to the Excel skills mentioned in the video, I recommend becoming familiar with Power Query in Excel as well.  
I work in an environment where I don't have access to a DBMS or Python, so I've been doing all of my analysis by writing SQL connections in Excel and then using Power Query for cleaning, transforming, and EDA (or pushing these into the SQL queries whenever possible).  
It's very intuitive if you already understand SQL and Pandas, and you can do some pretty useful analysis with it."
pvxNYyJuiqA,What about statistics?
pvxNYyJuiqA,I am a fresher.I am good at summerisation. It means I can make good summary from given data and analyse well. Will the job perfect for me ?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"SQL
Tableau / Power BI
Excel
Python
ETL
Machine Learning"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"What SQL DB system would you recommend to learn? MySQL. PostgreSQL or something else? I don't think I saw a video of yours discussing this, maybe I missed it?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Hi .. I apologize if this has been asked already ... Would you chose Ms Server SQL over MySQL? or does it not matter? thanks
pvxNYyJuiqA,Does SQL and Microsoft SQl are same or different. Please answer my query
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, every one, i really like your vedios, it's really straight forward and hit the point, i know and believe that nothing is too late but i have a question, i used to work as accountant the fun part for me was the analyzing, visualizing and reporting the financials i enjoyed that part a lot so I'm considering switching to data analysis career field the thing is I'm 38 now, is it still applicable to do so? thanks"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Alex I always get positive+ vibe from you thanks
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Thank you so much, it was a very helpful advice 👍"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Do we need any math ?
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thanks for the video. How would you rank your your sql beginner to advanced tutorials. Would they be enough to learn majority of sql?
pvxNYyJuiqA,are you planning to make SQL tutorials  aiming Data Analyst  ?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hello Alex, thanks for the amazing content. 
Please recommend a course for Excel for data analysis"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, thanks a lot for the video !!

Quick question : as you worked in a startup, do you really think that it’s better to learn how to use Tableau than Power BI in these small companies ? Thanks in advance !"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you so much for this
pvxNYyJuiqA,"1.Excel
2.Power BI
3.SQL
4.Python"
pvxNYyJuiqA,what about statistics? hypothesis? don't you think you need to learn it in order to identify patterns in your data?
pvxNYyJuiqA,so helpful to start thanks alex :) a big thumbs up for this video . <3
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, I have seen on a couple videos that you believe Excel to be a mandatory skill for aspiring data analysts. As someone contemplating the new Google certificate, I'm wondering if proficiency in Google Sheets can replace the need for Excel, or if companies will still want Excel-specific skills"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, could you please make a video about the skills that data scientist need to equipped and the order and the appropriate way to learn them? Thanks a lot!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,What about math?
pvxNYyJuiqA,Can you be a Data Analyst utilizing only Excel?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"How about sas , spss , agile ? Aren't they essential?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YPgdx2NdXw
pvxNYyJuiqA,Hi.. Very informative video. One question: How much math do I need to become data analyst and main thing I want to know what topics do we need to learn in Maths? Thank you
pvxNYyJuiqA,It would be great if you could make a video about what should a Data Analyst know in Pandas & Numpy.
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you so much Alex. This was the video i was looking for. Really appreciate your efforts.
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hey Alex! I have basic knowledge in Java, python and R and I learn things pretty quickly. Do you think that I can learn enough of sql, tableu, python packages and  excel in a month? Are online learning platforms like Udemy and coursera enough to do this ?
Thank you so much!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Thanks for making this video, Alex. Exactly what i needed now."
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thanks!
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thanks. Your videos are really helpful
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you!💖
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Ok, what if I know how to use Pandas for data wrangling, plotly express for data visualization, sci-kit learn for machine learning, beautiful soup for data scraping and Api when using requests, Tensorflow for DL etc. Would I still need to use SQL and Tableau? Dont get me wrong I know how to use them on a basic level and since I learned Python I use them a lot less now. Am I missing out?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hey, Alex.
I have notice that you mentioned data analyst need to do some project in order to get a entry level job.
But where I can find these projects? GitHub?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, how about ETL skills? Are those something we should pick up on our own or depends on the databases the company uses?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex thanks for this detailed informative video, want to ask y not power BI instead of tableau. whts the difference"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hello, super video I really like your videos.

Can you talk about the minimum level you need to have in mathematics please?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,i started learning VBA then i got lazy because i found out macros existed and i basically didn't need any more than what macros could do 😂
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi, when you give a timeline on how long to spend learning particular skill, what kind of background do you think one should have? I know excel quite well but spent far more than a week to learn vlook up, pivotal tables and conditional formatting. 
I even don’t want to think how long sql will take me."
pvxNYyJuiqA,Does this mean that Data Science and data analysis are completely different
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thanks very much. What about learning stats ?
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thanks man for your information 🙂
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great video! I have been working as a data science intern for the last 4 months, and I have been using SQL, Python, and Excel pretty much all the time. The other members of the team also use Tableau, so I can vouch for that too! Thanks a lot for the video!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Thank you so much Alex! I Really appreciate all your knowledge and experience. It is helping me a lot building my own career as a Data Analyst. Thanks a lot!
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great video, thanks Alex!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, first of all thanks a lot for your youtube channel. Great videos and content and very motivating. You mentioned that people should spend about 2 weeks - 1 month on SQL, 1 week - 1 month on Tableau, 1 week on Excel and 1 -3 months on Python. May i ask, is that based on learning 8 hours a day, 7 days a week or how many hours did you roughly calculate per week? And do you also have expierence in freelancing as a data analyst on upwork and so on? Stay safe"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Great Channel you've built Alex, I don't normally comment, but I'm really enjoying your videos. They are highly relatable, broad but yet also niche. Look forward to the future videos, as well as going over old videos you've uploaded."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Thank you so much Alex, you're the best!"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Do i need to be good in maths?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"hello alex i love your videos .
i want to apply in companys as a data analyst.will you recommend any company that accept freshers."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Alex, I don't know about others but I believe having Use Case series would be a fantastic addition to your content. One Use Case per week where you analyze certain data (from open source) using the mentioned skills Sql, Tableau, Excel, Python"
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Thank you, Alex. You make my transition to DA easy and focused."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"I am learning python now.  Taking a bit of time since excel, sql and tableau were accessible at where I work. Gotta keep up the grind!  Great vid as always."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"One to three months for python?? It's not SRS to say that 
It depends on what you know and the level you aim for and how smart you are.."
pvxNYyJuiqA,One needs to sit with an pen and notebook when listening to Alex
pvxNYyJuiqA,Hi can u do a video on what skills do I need to be business analyst? What r the similarities between them? Do I need to learn coding (phyton) for business analyst? My degree major is in business so I am leaning towards business analyst
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Hi Alex, 
Do you feel it's necessary to know how to use mysql via the cli, or would you recommend SQLite studio? Or something else?"
pvxNYyJuiqA,Please!! Make a video tutorial of a real life data pipeline or a real life data analyst project! Your content it's awesome and is helping me to get an idea of this amazing career. Thank you!
pvxNYyJuiqA,Can you become a data scientist without having a degree?
pvxNYyJuiqA,"Thanks a lot Alex for the video.
...I'm proficient in Power BI (all aspects, including DAX, M, Visualizations, complex table relationships, and Data Models, etc.) I'm also conversant with Power Query and Power Pivot on Excel, but I prefer doing all needed task on Power BI alone, without bringing Excel into the mix. Please, how much of this bias would be tolerated in the industry?
Thanks once again."
pvxNYyJuiqA,"The industries in my country(in south east asia) seems to combine data analyst & data scientist roles most of the time. I can hardly find the analyst position, it's always either data scientist or data engineer 🤷🏻‍♂️ What are your thought on this?"
rZpfNh28nFI,Super sorry about the bad quality here! Due to this I will be doing another Q/A next month with better quality GUARANTEED!
rZpfNh28nFI,"Hi Alex,
Besides SQL, what else should I study if I want to be a clinical data manager?
I am currently 5 months in a clinical data transcription (Data entry) job. I have a Psychology BA  ..how realistic  is it for me to get a clinical data management or analyst job soon?"
rZpfNh28nFI,"Hello, did anyone win the giveaway?"
rZpfNh28nFI,"Hi, Alex, 
I am a mechanical engineer with experience from an automotive manufacturing company. I am currently working with Udacity on a course on ML nanodegree using Azure. I was learning SQL as I figured out would need. Now, I don't know what kind of project I can have using SQL in my portfolio (can always google but, would appreciate if you could put some light on how to choose project for portfolio rather doing randomly)? Learning Tableau(Using their Tableau learnings platform)"
rZpfNh28nFI,hi alex enjoying your videos. you mentioned a udemy course you highly recommend for tableau which is good for dashboard creation etc - which one is this (i don't see anything obvious in the description). you also mentioned that it's easy to get stockmarket data to analyse - where is the best place to get that? can you recommend the best resources for data sets in general? thanks
rZpfNh28nFI,"Helloo sir,I would like to become a data analyst.I have 2 year gap after graduation and I don't gave experience.is it good to enter as data analyst.what should I do and where should I start.im business enthusiastic person.


Would you pleas reply in my mail- asifmangalad@gmail.com"
rZpfNh28nFI,Thanks for the Q&A Alex! I missed this one but will tune in for the next one. Can I ask - I have a degree in economics (which I enjoyed) and I’m considering moving into Analytics. Do you suggest a good way to get my feet wet and determine if this is an area I can excel in? I’m trying to really get a feel for the complexity of the work and if it’s right for someone like me. I appreciate your feedback!
rZpfNh28nFI,"Hey Alex, what part of SQL would be mostly used in analytics. Select-where based queries or Creating Databases & tables or conditional expressions - stored procedures. If the answer cannot be given in a word, please try to allot some percentages to it. Sorry for a silly ask.

I did complete a course  though but do wanna know specific areas if any.So, I can plan for a project within."
rZpfNh28nFI,you forgot the random question of the day or random veg or fruits
rZpfNh28nFI,"Talking things over with your wife...AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Vital to a great, loving home."
rZpfNh28nFI,"Free datasets for projects can be found at https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground. Remember also, Microsoft's AdventureWorks sample databases can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms."
rZpfNh28nFI,Do you think it is important to know how to create a database?
rZpfNh28nFI,"Hi Alex, missed the stream due to time zone. Would you recommend I brush up on my maths skills before starting to learn SQL?"
rZpfNh28nFI,"I lost the live, It was 3 am in Spain ^^
Thanks to motivate data analytics community with your videos and stay in alert with new skills in this field."
rZpfNh28nFI,"handled that provocative comment with class. Thought it could be interesting to talk about where you see yourself in 5, 10 or 15 years. Still in analytics, management etc."
rZpfNh28nFI,"With the knowledege you have now, can you jusst become a software developer if you want? 
Same question for: data scientist"
brxnKIy6Cek,Today I learned that my wife doesn't watch the show... what a disappointing day. Had a lot of fun making this though! :D
brxnKIy6Cek,"Carrots. Alex you have been a wealth of knowledge for data analytics and life in general. I applaud you for your transparency and honesty with this channel. You give people knowledge of the tech skills needed for the data sector as well as the soft skills needed to operate in the workplace. People overlook the importance of communication skills, emotional temperament and relationship building on the job. Blessings to you and your wife and your children."
brxnKIy6Cek,"""This is the head I fell in love with"" 😆"
brxnKIy6Cek,'Trying XYZ' I find that typical as a Data Analyst. We tend to want to know something about everything. You two have that good vibe that few couples seem to experience. 	🥕🥕🥕

brxnKIy6Cek,"Carrots! I like how your wife vibes so naturally and being such a cool sport, your situation is what I am fighting for while writing this message. I'm 30 coming from a field completely unrelated, very burnt out upskilling every day and still doing it because I really want this job. You're a living example I always tell myself: This dude was a doctor, with no knowledge in data, look at him now. What excuses do I have? Bravo Alex bless you with good life ahead"
brxnKIy6Cek,"I am smiling throughout the video seeing how happy you are with each other.

brxnKIy6Cek,This is amazing! great guy.
brxnKIy6Cek,"I wasn't planning to watch this episode, but your ramblings at the end of a different show led me here. Mrs. The Analyst is lovely and did a great job with her guest appearance. Alex, I wonder how you'd answer the marriage question now that you know she's not watching your videos :)  A carrot a day keeps the hackers at bay!"
brxnKIy6Cek,carrots 🥕
brxnKIy6Cek,Carrots. Loved her description of what data analytics is.
brxnKIy6Cek,Carrots 🥕😊 your wife is so down to earth and your relationship look healthy and both are a power couple and support each other. That’s awesome 👏🏻

You guys genuinely seem happy together and I love it 🤗 I am currently at the beginning stages in becoming a data analyst and its great to see the person behind ""the analyst."" I was literally laughing out loud when she said ""behind the curtain crunching numbers"" 😆 God bless you and your family Alex 🙏🏻"
brxnKIy6Cek,"Carrots -- It's so interesting because I really want to start my second career and I am between Psychology and Data Analysis. It was very interesting to see how different you are, and i feel like i will realize which career I like with time, but it seems like it can be one or the other, we'll see. : )"

I know you put a lot of time and effort into every video you make and I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything that you do! Secondly - CARROTS! Third - My favorite thing from this video was learning the similarities between you and me. When your wife talked about how detail-oriented you are, your logical thought processes, and how you research EVERYTHING, it helped confirm to me that Data Analytics is the right path for me because that's exactly how I am. Thank you so much for creating and sharing this personal video and thank you to your wife for joining you in this episode :)"
brxnKIy6Cek,🥕 Well done. This was a cute vid but my favorite part was when you discovered that she did not watch your videos. 😂 So cute and real!
brxnKIy6Cek,"Carrots 🥕.
Your wife is cerebral and logical"
brxnKIy6Cek,"21:06 so Alex was the gold digger in the relationship
It's funny how men use these words so casually without considering all the free work women do raising kids, household chores, sacrificing their jobs for your career etc.."
brxnKIy6Cek,"Yes, carrots!  I love that your wife is 'game' for things and yes, very supportive and graciously honest.  Great job!  I am new to the whole data world (just recently been using Excel) and like you (when you started) didn't realize what the other things were, though I've seen them in job postings.  I've been loving the formulas in Excel, but it is new for me.  Thank you again, for all the details that you share.  I appreciate the time you put in and that you care."
brxnKIy6Cek,CARROTS: You seem so genuine and you care and yoy love to share the gain knowledge about your field. Thanks Christine and Alex

brxnKIy6Cek,"Hey Alex. What I like most about seeing your wife here is that we can see the love you always talk about between you and your wife. And If it takes ""Carrots"" to show that I do care about, carrots they are. Cheers."

brxnKIy6Cek,how did you carrots do this summer?  also I majored in psychology in college and have never wanted to be a therapist (with the possible exception of being a play therapist) but data analysis seems pretty interesting.
brxnKIy6Cek,what's the cat's name?
brxnKIy6Cek,"Carrots. I really like your videos !! Congrats for the family. I are a huge reference to me. I am a database warehouse analyst, but looking forward to become a Data analyst.

brxnKIy6Cek,This is touching.
brxnKIy6Cek,"Carrot, I loved that you spent time to find out what you and the girl you like have in common before asking her phone number. Maybe I found this interesting because I feel more comfortable dealing with introverts because they're taking their time to get to know me before pushing things into me. Your wife is a great person as well. Wishing you a life full of happiness^.^"
brxnKIy6Cek,I love carrots 😀
brxnKIy6Cek,"I know the feeling , when she said she does not watch your video.. she has a great personality.. [carrot 🥕  🥕 ]"

brxnKIy6Cek,I like CARROTS :)
brxnKIy6Cek,"SQL is very important, noted."

ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hello Alex 
Before i start in this industry. I am watching different videos about data analysis. 

I would like to know which is the best course to start with in 2025. As these video was made 4 years ago? Should i go directly to IBM or Google data analysis or before should I start with small course ? 

Thank you.
Have a nice day"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Will these courses tell you if you need books or practice test books?

ySq0cgkZiX4,Thank you for sharing your valuable experience and knowledge about the data analytics course of udemy.
ySq0cgkZiX4,Very helpful video Alex. I have subscribed to your channel. I am looking for a  mentor. Do you offer any mentorship
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Thank you for the list, I’m definitely checking it out today, I’m really interested in a data analysis job. Real quick courses number 8 and 11 are no longer available, any alternatives? Or could you make a new top 10 list? Thank you 🙏🏼"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hi alex just wanna know do we need to do all of the course in the order that you've told and how much time will it take to complete them
ySq0cgkZiX4,"hello there, These 10 courses should be done for having a good knowledge in Data analytics"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Which platform is best for us to learn on? Udemy or coursera......what will you recommend
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex - Maybe a tough question but now that you've gone through udemy and coursera for SQL and Python, which platform would you recommend? Appreciate the response."
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hi Alex! Question: I’m considering taking the Google Professional Data Analytics course but I’m wondering if it’s a better investment in my time and money to just knock out the Udemy courses you recommend instead. The time commitment on each seems about the same per course but the Udemy courses seem to go further in depth while the Google program does come with a certificate and looks like it explains a lot about what a data analyst does. I truly value and appreciate your insight. Thanks you!!!
ySq0cgkZiX4,Are these courses still valid to take in 2023?
ySq0cgkZiX4,"did any body know how to get the discount on Udemy back? I just sign up my account right now after I had watched this video and finding the course that Alex has refered to, but after that I tried to click the link down below and ALL the discount I got is now gone. much appreciate any comment that would help"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hey Alex. The Python Automation Course is not available on Udemy anymore. Can you please give me an alternative for that? Thank you so much for helping us
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex i just completed your roadmap to be a data analyst, ive built my own website like you, but i still not confident enough to find a job, do you have any free course recommendation ? i cant afford it"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"When do you know if you have enough skills to get a job? I know some excel just from college, took 3 stats courses, but I only took 2 SQL udemy courses, and honestly I feel like an imposter. How can I land a data analyst job at a basic level where they don't mind training me more. I hate to keep taking courses my whole life with no job lined up."
ySq0cgkZiX4,The excel course you recommended isn't very good.
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex. 

Thank you very much for recommending my ""Querying Microsoft SQL Server with T-SQL"" Udemy course as the top course that you would recommend for become a Data Analyst. 

It's great this course allows you to get up to speed and learn what you needed for your job. I tried to make it be the course that I would have liked when I learned T-SQL, quite a few years ago! 

Thank you once again.

ySq0cgkZiX4,I want to achieve complete mastery of Microsoft office. What are best course for it?

ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex, I am excited to start my transition into Data Analysts career and your videos have helped with that. I was curious where I can find coupons or discount codes for these courses?"

ySq0cgkZiX4,Hi  I just did some research and discovered that the first course learning SQL and T SQL to prepare forthe Microsoft exam...has been retired.  (January 2021) I am bummed.  Is it still good to take this or is there adifferent course that coaches for the replacement test?
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hands down the best course for 2022 is 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass by Jose Portilla
ySq0cgkZiX4,"I have watched your videos on power bi courses and this udemy courses, I wonder where should i start first?

ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hello Alex,  I want to change my career as a Data Analyst. I do not have any coding/ tech experience. I do have some in depth experience with Excel. What should I do to land my first job as DI. And what core courses do you recommend to take as principal for DI? Thank you so much, Alex"

ySq0cgkZiX4,Thank you a ton Alex
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hey Alex. just found your channel and the videos have been great! Just a quick question. I have prior knowledge with other programming languages but very little for what's required to be a data analyst. If I go through the courses from this list could knowing the info from the courses be enough to land first role as a data analyst? I would greatly appreciate your response!
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Thanks Alex, super helpful videos. Can I check  that this list of videos is relevant today (Oct 21)? Would you recommend any changes/new technologies?"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hello Alex, Thank you for the video. It will be helpful for the people who need guidance or path in the data analyst career and I am one in that.  I saw many videos in the Udemy its bit confusing which one to choose. So, the course you mentioned in the above video is enough to become a data analyst."
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex, (my namesake). Thank you for this information. Your videos are really inspiring and guiding me as I prepare to become a DA. I have subscribed to your channel so that I can get every bit of your lately uploaded videos. 

I only have one urgent quiz that's really confusing me and I would like your advice on it. Should  I learn VBA Excel 1st or should I learn SQL 1st?  I am torn between this two skills and I don't know where to begin. Kindly advice me accordingly."
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex, because you recommended it, I have bought the Excel course but not the one you mentioned but the whole Excel package from ZandaX in order to learn EVERYTHING (I learnt Office 2003 long years ago).
My question is: If I learn the courses you mentioned is it enough to get a job as a Data Analyst? If not what am I need? I am 30 and want to switch career, so universities aren't option."
ySq0cgkZiX4,"May I ask what is a good SQL Certification to get for entry level IT career start? Still going thru your videos to see a suggestions, tyty in advance"
ySq0cgkZiX4,I'm seriously considering doing all of this now. . .
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Very helpful video and more discount on courses price 😂

Thanks Alex"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hey ALex. thanks for the  recommendations. I am doing master in Business Analytics and I am pretty sure these courses will help me to polish my skills. I have one question the first course you mentioned doesn’t give option to download on Mac. please explain that. thanks
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex, I have been watching your videos for a couple of months now.  Could you create a video of how to share your work on github?  I only have a private API from my IBM account.  I was told that there is a way to create a public API to be able to share your SQL work/portfolio but I am not sure how to do that.  Any advice?"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hey Alex, What do you suggest? Taking these seperate courses or a single Google/IBM certification program? Considering I'm a mechanical engineer, and have no knowledge of python, SQL, or the visualisation tools. Thank you."
ySq0cgkZiX4,So is it safe to assume to not get the courses from your past video about courses for data analysts and Get the courses listed here instead? Thank you!
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex,
It will be a great help if could make a video on GCP and Data Engineering courses!"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Please do a video on this for Business Analyst and Marketing Analyst. Thank you thank you


!"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Would I be able to take these courses and then get a job?
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex,
I Just want to know if these courses are online or just recorded videos and one thing about fraud protection while buying courses.
thanks,"
ySq0cgkZiX4,The first course shown says it won’t run on Mac unless you have dual desktop I think? My new MacBook is coming this week. Is there a way to do that?
ySq0cgkZiX4,would you recommend getting a macbook air/pro m1 or a pc for someone who will be studying business analytics?
ySq0cgkZiX4,Is this still valid for today ?
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hey Alex, I'm doing MBA in Operations and I want to pursue the DA career path. But I don't know how to start or in which direction should I go or if this would be a good career choice for me."
ySq0cgkZiX4,Just signed up for my first class!
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex, thank you for the amazing work ! I recently signed up for the Microsoft Advanced Course for Data Analysis that you recommended, I'm a bit disappointed to be honest. The course doesn't provide the matching workbook for their lecture and makes it hard to follow. Their provided exercises are lacked of instruction, you would not know what to do with the exercise  because there is no question or what not... Can you recommend another excel course?"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Extremely informative and extremely helpful. Bless you , brother"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex,
I want to learn Data analytics (as a beginner), so should I start one by one with these courses in order?"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Jose portilla is the BEST
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex! is it OK to take only 1 of the 3 SQL courses, or i need all the 3? I didn't understand that part :D Thank you for everything!"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex. I have a question to you. Upon this video, I took MySQL for Data analytics and business intelligence course and I dont regret for my decision. It has been going really great. But I am stuck in the Section 19: Advanced SQL topics. 

I need your advice. Do you think that Advanced SQL topics like variables, global variables, and indexes are used in data analytics? Should I push myself to learn them or I will actually probably never use them?

Thank you a lot!"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex does this course suitable for beginners """"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning"""
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Good afternoon Alex, 
Thank you for your wonderful videos. How and where do I get those coupons so I can start taking some of those classes? Thank you again"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex, I love you! ❤️ You have no idea how much you inspired and helped me!"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Hi alex  do u need to have computer language background  for this data anayltics ?
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi
I like to switch career to data analyst 
Can I send you mail"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Should i do this courses in order or randomly ?
ySq0cgkZiX4,Alex..thanks for sharing excellent information..
ySq0cgkZiX4,"hey alex first of all thanks for such informative video , i just had question ,  i took the 365 carrer course and i , wanted to ask that is this course enough to gain knowledge about sql for entry level jobs as data analyst or are there some topics that are missing as u said this course focuces more on BI and not on data analyst"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hi Alex, great video. I took the MySQL course as my first course diving into the data analyst world. I really liked the 365Careers instructor. 

Could you provide feedback on your thoughts for their course: “The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp 2021”

It dives into Python.. thanks"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Which is better? 

Doing Google's data analytics course or doing these 10 courses ??

Plz guys suggest me"
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Great Video, very helpful-
Do you respond to emails?
If so please could you share your email address ? (for some advice)
Thanks"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Thank you Alex.  I have been researching and planing to start my journey into becoming a Data Analyst.This video is very helpful
ySq0cgkZiX4,Am I only who thought sql zero to hero is very basic?
ySq0cgkZiX4,"I found your channel months ago, your contents are absolutely magnet to me, thank you for your hard work. Would you recommend LinkedIn Learning as a good platform? I been learning over there and felt left out from the self-learning community. Hopefully there is top n list for LinkedIn too"
ySq0cgkZiX4,SO much to learn!!!!!!! :)
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex pls tell the difference between the big data solution architect  and data analysist. Which is easy, coding needed and salary. Pls pls"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Alex I appreciate your videos! Since the pandemic I have been fascinated with learning data analytics. I found your channel just yesterday because I wanted information on whether boot camps were value for money. I have been deep diving in your videos since. You are definitely giving me a roadmap to how to move forward. Thank you!
ySq0cgkZiX4,Is taking classes like these and the ones you mentioned in the video about coursera good for getting an entry-level data analysis position?  Or is it better to have a masters in data analysis or data science or take classes through an accredited program?
ySq0cgkZiX4,should data analysts learn data warehousing and data modeling?
ySq0cgkZiX4,I'm not from an English country. Could you please suggest if there is any course/any resource that can teach us some communication skills as well specifically for data analysts on any platform?
ySq0cgkZiX4,I was looking for the statistical course and I got the answer thanks for the video!!
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hello Alex, thank you for the recommendations. Do you think one can find a job or an internship only with udemy courses ?"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Wow 👏 love you 😍many thanks
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Hey Alex, I'm getting a feeling that ETL is some very broad context , so what's your suggestions to start learning it, any online courses ?"
ySq0cgkZiX4,Which option should i pick up for data Analyst- Udemy or Coursera? Which one would be better according to you?
ySq0cgkZiX4,thanks you
ySq0cgkZiX4,"I wonder if these courses are supposed to be taken in the order you have listed them, same for the Top 10 for coursera. Great work, Alex."
ySq0cgkZiX4,Have you heard anything about the Google data analyst course? I thought it is supposed to come out in 2020
ySq0cgkZiX4,"Alex, do you think an advanced formal degree is necessary for this profession.  I have a Master's in Health Science and would like to become a Health Data Analyst."
ySq0cgkZiX4,"In my company a lot of my internal customers are not python savy.  They want all the automation of reports to happen in excel.  Some folks may run into that so being really good at excel , including VBA may be worth investigating."
ySq0cgkZiX4,Good info.  I noticed in one of your other videos though that you would not put on linked in or a resume that you took a course on udemy.  Would it may be good to start going through comparative classes on coursera or a platform for each of these subjects and put them on your linked in and or resume?
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,I was able to get my first Job as a Data analyst thanks to you. you're Awesome Man
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Do u recommend any of the certifications from DAMA international? Is it worth it?
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"You are the best rumbler Alex! Even 5 years from then... love the vanilla almond Magnum ) Better than a story, I wonder where the best place (or courses) to learn Scala and Spark? I think the best part of the show was when you gave your perspective as an employer on projects vs certifications, what they mean to you on the resume 👍"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,🥬
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Awesome video!  It's definitely been a huge help for me to transition into this career.....also, red raspberry!!  Soo good!"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,don't have a radish story but my favorite ice cream is cookie and cream!
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Any tips on how to take the fear away of codinge exercises. I avoid them with all my heart
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Matcha & Cookies ice cream. Thanks for being a great guide 🙌🏼
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Lemon and berries
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Strawberry/Vanilla Ice Cream.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,wow for the microsoft cert. I just found a place inAustralia doing it. They are charging 900 australian dollars for the exam. What a scam. I wonder if I can pay and try from microsoft directly?
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Alex do  you think the CFI  BIDA certificacion north it
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"AWS or Azure certification, considering yoru vid is now 3 years old and Azure is catching up quickly?"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Appreciate your video! Watched until the end and even though this is 2 years later, my radish story is that I was eating this stew and was excited that there were potatoes except when I bit into it, it was really soft and tasted horrible. It wasn’t a potato, it was a boiled radish. 

Also my favourite ice cream is strawberry with strawberry chunks! 

I watched until the end because its easier to listen to longer videos when I’m doing something like running or driving and I was too busy to stop the video earlier. At some point I realized you kept going on purpose and I decided to keep listening. I felt you were trying to get rid of me early for some reason and I wasn’t going to let you win!! Hahaha did you reverse psych me? Probably. Have a good one!"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Blue Bunny Cherry Chocolate Chunk
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,A certificate and a certification are two very different things and are not interchangeable
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Your videos are the best! Tillamook mudslide!!
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Chocolate/Peanut butter
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Which Course should I do to prepare for this certification
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,I love cookies and cream and cookie dough mixed together!!!!🍦
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,nice spicy hot radish put in icy cold water. yum! radish greens from the garden are also yummy!
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,I never get even close to radishes and it's probably because of a traumtazing childhood memory that I can't get to remember. Thanks again for the content Alex! - Edit : Chocolat ice cream
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Stracciatella
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Do you have a review on the Charlotte Chaze program?
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"here in the UK data certifications, bootcamps, have not helped me....its work experience through internship using projects that get foot in the door"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Do you have to have a bachelors degree? I have an associates degree in Liberal arts Math and science. Im wondering if getting a certificate is enough to get a job if i dont have a bachelors degree.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Thanks for all the videos you posted - looking to change domaines and am currently brand new to this field. Fav ice cream: Thai milk tea - it's the goat
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Hello Alex! Im from Nicaragua 🇳🇮!! My favorite ice cream is Ron con pasas , rum with raisins. It takes me back to my childhood. My parents gave the that , and made me feel good. 👌 .. Recently just started data analyst job revamping my role as supervisor in a logistics company. Discovered your channel and motivated me to push through."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,My favourite ice cream flavour is “flocos” which is a Portuguese word to name a kind of vanilla ice cream with pieces of chocolate. Watched from company computer and came to my phone to comment 😅
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"if anyone is watching this, its worth noting the google's coursera courses are a *certificate* NOT not *certification*
a certificate is worth almost nothing on a resume - a certification is actually worth something if you are being compared to a similar candidate

I took the coursera courses that he constantly shills and it did absolutely nothing for my resume - be careful what you put your time into."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,So Udemy sucks because it doesnt have the big names certification background. Well ... that's were I've been learning. Fuck.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Radish,butter scoth"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Ice cream !!! Lemon and passion fruit curd
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Lol Radish - i dislike it raw but fermented asian style, it's wonderful 😊"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Thanks Alex. Hope all is well. Thanks for sharing this information. Very useful. Radishes, I understand. Green macha tea ice cream"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,What’s a portfolio? Does it have all the things you worked on in it? How do I set one up so I can start doing things while in school?
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Love radishes! Hate beets though.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Okay I actually got to the very end and I’m literally laughing. 😂😂My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate chip. Thank you for the video. It’s very informative.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Timestamps please
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Sorry I love rudish
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,My favorite ice cream is Oreo cookie 🍪 crumble ❤ 33:11
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Cookie Dough for the Long Game.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,I looooove Rocky Road and Cookies N Cream 🍦
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Any cone ice cream like those Connetto or Nestle type. Hahaha....

Hate the smell of radish when cooked as soup. You won't want to be under the same roof. Horrible smell.

Alex, Thank you so much for sharing. I am so excited about all your videos. Gonna catch up watching them all.

Take care, Alex.
 
 Cheers."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,No radish stories but I love turnips since Animal Crossing😑✌🏻

aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Hey Alex! This is very resourceful! Thank you for making this video, you're awesome!! My fave ice cream for now is Ben & Jerry Everything but the ...."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,rocky road ice cream though while I practice sql queries and my tableau dashboards really just hit a spot though...
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Radish's just no..simply no
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"I've completed the Google Data analyst certification 

Now I am going to go do the Microsoft certification

Thanks so much Alex!
You are the best

P.s my favourite ice cream flavour is chocolate chip dark chocolate"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Many thanks for your helpful videos! & regarding your question at the end: maybe reddish ice cream 🤔 jk😅 no but seriously who doesn’t like reddish..🤯
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,The only SQL certification that I've heard that is decent is the one from Oracle...The MySQL Admin and MySQL Developer...the only thing is that they are very hard.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Noooo! Radishes are great!! Put some salt, olive oil and lemon juice. Yammy and crunchy 😁"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,my favorite ice cream is caramel... thanks for the videos Alex!
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Hi Alex,

Just a thought on the DA training/course 'market'.

I was wondering why DA training/courses are 'sold' as certificates when the costs (close and upwards of £6k or £7k) seem close to those of full academic degrees (diplomas, or masters), even when provided (or co-provided) by universities themselves.

Is it because employers prefer these certificates over academic degrees?

Or they are too short in duration, or the content not extensive enough, to be considered degrees?

Would be grateful for any input or advice as I don't want to commit to spending that is driven mostly by marketing trends as distinct from actual professional need (eg obtaining other ways to bolster CV in terms of DA training, via other options such as MOOC certifications; portfolios etc).

Thanks"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Thanks for your videos man! I am starting to transtion my career from usps to data analyst and found your channel and this is what im lookin for im scared to take the leap but i know nothings gonna happen if i dont do it.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,You said at one point if you have over a year of experience. What if it’s not experience in data analysis. I’ve done tech support for 2 years out of college .
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Also, I like raddishes so I stuck til the end. I just dont like the smell of it. Good stuff thanks for the video."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"So you would agree to take a bachelors or masters in data analytics or scientist over a certification correct? I know each one like python, rutgers has a 6 months course. Would you suggest to take each course separately if so, can someone have a possible chance of getting at least 80k a year? also dont put that in my resume then? and i hate when jobs say experience what about for new graduates? they dont have experience yet."

aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Vanilla ice cream. ;).  Im late to the game Alex but i appreciate your content. I'm a self proclaimed data nerd and i hadn't realized that the work i was doing was bordering on Data Analytics so now I'm binge watching your vids hoping to glean some knowledge and courage to transition into this world 😁
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"I appreciate the transparency of this subject. You are awesome, Alex!"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,My favorite ice cream is vanilla 😂
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,My favorite ice cream is cold stone 😂 I’m glad I found this page Alex 💝
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"The Last few minutes >>>>>
My favourite Ice cream flavor is Vanilla.
I've taken the Google Data Analytics Proffesional Course, currently taking the IBM(wouldn't have if I've seen this first. Lol)
I tried to schedule my Microsoft Bi Exam, but apparntly, we can't pay for it with our card here (Nigeria). Please any Idea on how I can go around it?
Thank You Alex."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Mint chocolate chip 🍨
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,I really love vanilla ice cream!
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Alex, I appreciate you for rambling at the end of your videos because it adds levity because it cracks me up every single time 😄. Btw, I'm a Foodie and favorite ice cream flavor is Baskin-Robbins World Famous Chocolate 🍫 mousse ice cream 🍦 which an uber decadent swirl of milk chocolate and rich vanilla mousse ice cream. I was laid off 4 weeks ago after 16 years of experience in the mortgage loan servicing industry due to a forecasted downturn which the sector poorly fumbled 🏈 by prioritizing investor profits over people. People are workers and voters with a long-term memory 🧠! ! I've decided to add new professional skills to leverage the time off work as an opportunity to pivot my career focus moving forward. I find your technical career advice to be very insightful in making a decision between Data Analytics or UX Design as a strategic pivot point for the next chapter of my professional skill set's story 📚."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,vannila
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"What I have found about your channel Alex - by watching in random, 6-7 first videos, is that, you show an originality that is derived from the fact that , you are anxious sometimes for how the video or the Live is going to end up (is gonna end well, will people like it?) and you honestly share that anxiety with Us. Obviously many Youtube Channels  Owners have an anxiety, but very few of them sincerely share that. For me that is a +plus for your channel and You."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Lol I buy reddish with hope to make it, but it ends up rotting🤦🏾😅 ... but it's less than a dollar this side.

My fav ice cream is Tin Roof Ice Cream ... it's basically Vanilla with toasted almonds and chocolate sauce."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Habanero Alex. Habanero dude😉
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"from chocolate, to pistachio, to rocky road,to chocolate again, now I've settled with cookies and cream as my favorite ice cream. the contrast of soft and bitey crunch of cookies within the ice cream is just heaven for me"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"i am currently in the path for data analyst. However, I am terrify because I do not know much about computer or coding. hopefully I can learn a lot and make it my new career."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,hey man.... i love a good radish 😁
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,You are good 👍
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Radish:)) Vanilla & Chocolate Ice-cream. 
Thanks Alex for being a light in this world for others.
Much thanks"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Thanks Alex! your story has given me the courage i needed. And you did simplify the whole process as it was seeming very ambiguous before. I know absolutely nothing in the field because i am switching careers. And so you know, i am part of the jalapeno team.😃😃"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Me at the beginning: Ooohhh, free Microsoft Certification.... 
Me at the end: yeah F radishes XD
Forest berry ice cream is the best!"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Butter pecan is my favorite ice cream I've been watching a ton of your videos today thank you for your dedication
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Radishes are the worst
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"I've just finished 7 of 8 courses for the Google Data Analytics course and the 8th one is the capstone project. I do agree that courses don't go into depth about the moduels we learn such as Sheets, Tableau, R, etc. But they are a good starting point and they do encourage self learning which is a must in this field of work. The capstone is still kicking my ass at this point but it's been a fun journey so far and I'm looking forward to getting the hang of analytics soon."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,I love me some chocolate ice cream but add brownies and I’m in heaven lol
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Almost 2 years since this video dropped and I'm now taking my raddish ice cream! What a gem this channel is!
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Mint Chocolate chip
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Thank you so much Alex . I always enjoy watching your videos to the very last. I enjoy every bit of your sense of humour.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,What python certification do you recommend?
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Radish, more like Rubbish"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Thanks for your videos, Alex.  I just finished the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate on Coursera.  It was a good mix of data concepts and hands-on with SQL (Google BigQuery), Tableau and R.  It involves videos, reading, quizzes and hands-on projects.  The fact that it is structured helped me stay on track.  I spent 3 hours per day at an easy pace.  The only thing to note is that you learn basic R instead of Python.  A little note for those taking the course:  the dataset for global CO2 emissions by year lacks data for Germany and Russia prior to 1994.  The Tableau graph  showed a discontinuity and I had to be a detective and find the issue."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,Alex i breached my way into a Master Computer Programming by taking coursera courses and the university gave me credits finishing my degree in record time saving tonns of money
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Your videos are amazing. You are fun to watch, learning is just so easy with you. Thank for sharing this information. My fav ice cream is Strawberry😊"
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Oh yeah, I hate radishes. Not specifically so, just with the same general hatred I have for all vegetables. My deepest animosity is reserved for that vile weed the onion."
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,My favorite Ice cream is the new Oatmeal cream pie ice cream. It is legit amazing.
aJ9Q10v8Nrc,"Favorite? It'd have to be Soy Dreamy from Trader Joes, the cherry with chocolate chips. Tried it for the first time during a Christmas dumpster dive to feed the homeless and hungry. Thank you for your content, it's a huge help!"

I would like to ask a question, since you mentioned that you work with almost all the department in the company but not with HR department. How HR and Data Analysts are connected? I am seeing a lot of vacancy for HR Data Analysts, can you tell me a bit more about working as HR Analyst?"

C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli. Thanks Alex
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Hi Alex, I think It's one of your best video.
It's very important to know yourself and if you want to work with Startup or big company. In my opinion, you learn more stuffs working with Startup but you have the stability with big companies. You could add to work in consulting, to go to work in a company but it's your client"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli 🥦 😁😋
C2ik_qR5GOU,"First of all, broccoli. It sounds nice and it is very similar in Portuguese, my native language: brócolis.
Amazing video, Alex.
I am just starting my life here in the USA and I was already a Data Analyst in Brazil. 
Now that I have authorization to work here, I am applying for jobs as a data analyst too. And man, market here is crazy. Especially during pandemic. Every position that I think I am a good fit, I have more 200 people competing with me.
Anyway. I am 28, no kids, live with my husband. I never worked for a startup, but it feels like I am going to learn a lot and that will help me with my path to a big company in the future.
I really appreciate your channel and all of your tips. 
Now I know what to expect if I get hire by a startup."
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Tell your son your fans like Broccoli, too!

I’m new to Data Analytics. I was lucky enough to find a position in the field. It’s an interesting blend of Fortune 500 job security and training with a the same kind of variety you’d find at a small business. Unfortunately, the pay is like a small business as well. 

What skills (beyond the basics - SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel) could I focus on to make myself valuable? What soft skills would be useful?"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Is it hard to switch between different jobs with different data domains? Or once your in healthcare then that’s your field ?
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Broccoli! Appreciate your channel, lots of helpful insights and tips."
C2ik_qR5GOU,"I've worked as an IT Support at a Start-Up company. It wasn't the best, to say the least. What would you say to the employees who are starting fresh at a start-up with how to handle the workload, the fast pace environment, the many hats you might wear, and the stress level? By the way, I love broccoli 🥦I consistently eat it most days along with my chicken and rice"
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Broccoli 🥦 

Love your channel, Alex! 

I feel super stuck in my current job, but i’m constantly working towards improving my statistics knowledge and also learning sql on udemy,

It’s so difficult right now here in India to get a new job because of the pandemic situation, but I truly hope that in the next few months to come, I’d be able to bag my first job as a data analyst:D 

Wish me luck!"
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Broccoli 🥦
Working with startup is really an advantage to grow your skills! I have a question please.. Since, I am a self paced learner, and if I wanted to complete some projects on Data analytics (real time will be a plus), which website or way you would suggest me to achieve some projects which are recognized by the industries for an Entry level or Associate Data Analyst?
It would be really helpful for lot of us. Since, most of the freshers like me are stuck onto this (who are self paced learners), we don't know where to exactly apply our knowledge and most important, very few companies offers a data analyst jobs to freshers with no projects. They need experience, So may be doing industry recognized or real time projects might help us?"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli. Thanks Alex. Keep rocking 👏
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Hello, Alex. I Want to ask you one question related with BA vs DA. Can I ask it via e-mail?"
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Broccoli-
Hi Alex! Thanks for the great perspective of what it's like working at a start up versus a Fortune 500 company. I think the knowledge you shared on what a role at each of these types of companies is fantastic information to know. Awesome video! Keep them coming!"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Max 😍😍😍
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Hey Alex! Great content as always. I am a newbie and I am still learning the softwares you recommended for data analysis. I just wanted to know what are the steps you follow when you're assigned a task.
Thanks!"
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Even with butter, children will still not like broccoli 🥦"
C2ik_qR5GOU,🥦🥦🥦 broccoli
C2ik_qR5GOU,"As someone who interned at a Fortune 500 Company and got her first job at a small media company, the differences in benefits were a total shock. I agree though that this experience is only going to make me a stronger candidate in the future for large company, when I’ll be needing more money for my family. Also, how cute is Max?! 🐕 🥦"
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Hey Alex! Great content. Thank you. I had a conversation with a friend on the Dev side of the business. He mentioned that (SAFe) Scaled Agile Framework expertise is becoming a highly prized skillset. Since you work at an enterprise-level organization, can you speak to your experience working in that environment, any Agile frameworks utilized, and any expectations from your management related to your professional development? Thanks in advance!"
C2ik_qR5GOU,🥦 🐕!
C2ik_qR5GOU,"So funny you keep hitting perfect topics for me! Currently on contract as a data analyst (tho there isnt much analysis in my work - i'm doing routine procedures and also building and debugging data pipelines) - anyways, on contract at a fortune 100 company and looking at Data Engineering roles there.  Last job was a single-person-with-some -help shop where the stability of the company seemed to fluctuate by the hour.  I dont really like either - but I have an HR screening at a mid-sized company? its been around 10 years and has approximately 100 employees.  it sounds perfect to me! (My husband does the health insurance for our family)"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli 🥦
C2ik_qR5GOU,"Broccoli! 🥦 Also, good to see little Max joining you 🐶"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli yo!
C2ik_qR5GOU,"I'm 39 and I too am a family man-data analyst with four kids and agree that the benefits are a huge deal when your a bit older and have a spouse and kids. 
Sounds like you have a lot of different work experiences in the data field.  What do you think your next title will be,  DBA, data engineer, data scientist, report programmer, some sort of data analytics manager or something else?"
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli :)
C2ik_qR5GOU,I am in FP&A. Barely starting your video. But start ups all the way!!!!!!!!!!!
C2ik_qR5GOU,Hii Alex in one of the live session you promised me about you will make a video on skill path followed by a data analyst kindly please upload as soon as possible
C2ik_qR5GOU,Broccoli!!
mLUzFXPPa4I,Good job
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Only found your channel now, looking to transition from hospitality to data analytics. Hope this information is relevant still today 🙏"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Still top 10 courses for 2025? please reply @Alex
mLUzFXPPa4I,"How long would it take to do all these courses? Apologies if this was asked, I didn’t see the answer"
mLUzFXPPa4I,V?iH
mLUzFXPPa4I,V
mLUzFXPPa4I,V
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Awesome video! This helps quite a bit. 

I found similar courses on coursera and wanted to get your opinion. I noticed they include a lot of the material from the courses you recommended. 

I'm assuming these are just newer courses they structured to be complete packages and easier to follow. Would these two be good points to start at? 

IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate 
IBM Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst Professional Certificate"
mLUzFXPPa4I,My only complaint is that Coursea seems to be adding pay walls on some of these things. Like having coursea plus and then getting smacked with the specialization pay their as well is kinda annoying.
mLUzFXPPa4I,"alex, i really adore you. how many years you achieve all of this knowledge??"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thanks Alex. Just found your channel.  Excellent content!
mLUzFXPPa4I,To become data analyst we have to learn python first?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey alex what about your playlist for DA 😅😅 isnt it good for beginners, i am new to this channel"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Ive gained skills in SQL up to a joins, order by and subquery level. Would you recommend i need to go further?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"I find that there are two types of data analysts, one is based on statistics, and another is based on machine learning. Is that right?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,It would be so cool if they added community colleges in Coursera
mLUzFXPPa4I,"As someone who's from local PwC, I'm actually surprised that there is a PwC course in the list. Looks like I have to give it a try sooner or later 😆"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thanks Sir
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thanks bro! You inspire.
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you :D
mLUzFXPPa4I,Python for Everyone or Python 3 which is best from Michigan university
mLUzFXPPa4I,https://youtu.be/PuvQIIoIs34
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Alex, could you clarify on these courses? 1: Are these courses all you need to learn to become a data analyst? (2: How much time did you spend taking these courses and getting good at it? (3: What else did you have to do to prepare yourself to get a job? Thanks."
mLUzFXPPa4I,I'm interested in a career change I have the IT fundamental skills do you this it would make sense to complete the google it support program to enhance my IT skills then go for google data analyst certificate?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Another great video...im on cursera and I cant see how do I take the course as a standalone please?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Excellent info one of the best youtubers out there good job Alex ! 
Would there be any specific order you would advise new comers to take ?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,What is goin on everybody ;)
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you so much for the help but I want to know one thing should I take all these courses before joining Google data analyst course or directly join Google data analyst course without taking all of of those as mentioned on your video
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you so much for this video. I just have a question would the recommendations for the order in which you take these courses still be the same now that there is a IBM as well as a Google data analyst certification course offered on coursera?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"good informative video... Question: I just finish the IBM data science professional cert. what will you recommend as the next? I have been looking at the Coursera specialized courses ""Machine Learning Specialization & Statistics with Python Specialization. my goal is, after > 25 yrs in the IT industry, to make a career move/change... ;)"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you Alex for showing for as I am studying Data Analysis
mLUzFXPPa4I,Great Content. Currently I am studying Masters in Germany in International Marketing and Media Management. I have started Business Intelligence course in my masters program. I am interested to start my career as Data Analytics in Germany or North America. Do you have some advice for me?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Bless you brother
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thankyou  🙂
mLUzFXPPa4I,Are the courses free?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Dont know if you think of this too but I cant wait to see you doing your own data analysis specialization. im sure it will turn out great <3
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hi Alex, thank you for this video it’s informative. May I ask what course do you recommend for someone like me who wants to be into data analysis field but has no experience. I only knew basis excel but really into data gatherings and presentation. I’m currently working in compliance and always use excel for my masterlist."
mLUzFXPPa4I,Introduction to data science by IBM in that we have some knowledge for python also? But if we don't know about python then ????
mLUzFXPPa4I,Did he took this course? How he knows how well their are?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hi Alex, what do you think about Linkedin Learning for Data Analyst?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,You're a life saver 🙏
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Wow, I didn't know chuck had a python course on coursera. He also has a 9 hour tutorial on youtube and a book version of that tutorial where he teaches python from scratch and covers almost every basic concept you need before you start working with data using python. Don't know if the video and the coursera videos are same or not. I learnt much more from that video than 6 months in my college."
mLUzFXPPa4I,Wow I just discovered you last night and watched this and some of your other videos. Amazing! I have been a data analyst in the past and want to get back into it. I must say I think it is difficult to switch careers like you did! Thank you for all this help to us with some career issues. This makes me excited about my future and I will watch more of your videos! Thank you! No words can express my thanks and wish there was a way to email you but I understand why there is not! lol
mLUzFXPPa4I,Is google data analytics course worth it?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey Alex, do I need to take all these courses?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Are there updates to this after the Google certification came out?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey, Alex, can you advise a course for a data analyst junior?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Can a Biostatistician work as Data Analyst?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Do these Python courses include libraries?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Alex, are you going to update this video because we have Google data analysis course on Coursera since you published this ???"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey Alex
I've just search the coursera for the databases and sql for data science course and I didn't find it! I think the course is replaced with Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python, am I right?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thanks Alex!
mLUzFXPPa4I,What timing I was just thinking that top courses for analyst and here I'm your video shown as recommend for watching... Now I'm clear without an doubts😌 u explain very well
mLUzFXPPa4I,Was just recommended to your channel! Lets see if this is for me
mLUzFXPPa4I,so which ones are better the courses from coursera  or udemy?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thanks alot. Will follow this
mLUzFXPPa4I,Can you make a video about UX design? Is that something you would be willing to explain and take us thru?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Alex all this information is more than super useful-Thank you!!!
mLUzFXPPa4I,"I can’t tell you how much I appreciate your time, energy and experience.   And your passion is so contagious!    I can’t thank you enough.   I have access to LinkedIn learning for free via my library so I’m not sure if Coursera would be more useful, but if I decide to go ahead and subscribe, I will definitely use your affiliate link.   Really appreciate your help, Alex."
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Mr. Alex, can I learn MS Excel 1st and then SQL and then Tableau? ^_^"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hello, can you please make a list of courses for business analyst as well?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you for the incredible information
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey , I want to see myself as a Data Analyst in three months and do at least 3,4 projects in Data Analysis field , so what would be anyone's suggestion about which courses to do ?! I've enrolled in Google Specialization but it seems a bit long considering my time goal . ( I'll be devoting by complete weekends to study these courses ). Any suggestions are welcomed ❤️"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Is IBM professional certificate also great to start with?
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thanks for the compilation!
mLUzFXPPa4I,I am looking to start my career in Dat Analytics. Alex please advise me what courses shall i start with? Or if there is a video on it please share the link. I am looking to start with free courses.
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thumbs up for putting the list in the description.
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you man love you from Palestine ❤️
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Thank you very much ALEX. I have been searching for this content for a month. 
Once again Thank you 🥰🤝"
mLUzFXPPa4I,I signed up for coursera today and they recommended the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. Would that be something worth doing before getting started with these?
mLUzFXPPa4I,what corses to tweek or add to start big data path and what is relevant to me since iam coming from ERP CONSULTING BACKGROUND
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hello Alex , I have some questions for you. How much will be an initial investment to learn the basic to be considered as a data analyst for a job? What about html or java? Do you have to pay and install python and tableau in your laptop to be able to take the courses? Thank you"
mLUzFXPPa4I,What is your suggestion with regards to the Machine Learning course by Stanford University prof Andrew Ng and Deep Learning course also by him. Is is required for a data analyst? I am a mechanical engineer by profession
mLUzFXPPa4I,I am only doing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate which covers most of the topics you mentioned.How does the Data visualization with Tableau from UC Davis compare to Data Visualization with Python course by IBM within the professional certificate ?
mLUzFXPPa4I,What you think about the pwc data analytics courses ??
mLUzFXPPa4I,How much time That cost to learn all these courses?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Very helpful, thank you!"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"How did you study while you were doing these courses? I.e. did you take notes with the quizzes, or just do the quizzes?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Python for everybody specialization is a masterpiece for beginners
mLUzFXPPa4I,Awesome content
mLUzFXPPa4I,"This was very helpful, Alex. Thanks."
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hello Alex. I wanted to ask about something. I plan to attend a bootcamp of data analysis from Yandex Practicum, 6 months where there are included every topic of data analysis and they have about 15 projects until the end of the bootcamp.Do you think it is valuable and what is your opinion on bootcamps?
Thank you very much for your videos and worthfull information."
mLUzFXPPa4I,"So can we choose the program from here and do where it is free..
Like for First course it is also offered by IBM on Edx so can I do course from there will the quality be same?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey, Alex.
You mention that a data analyst needs to do some projects to get an entry level job.
Where can I find these projects?
Thank you."
mLUzFXPPa4I,"What do you think of the ""Advanced Business Analytics"" of University of Colorado? Thank you"
mLUzFXPPa4I,this is super super helpful!
mLUzFXPPa4I,I'm very happy that 2/10 courses you recommend is also impressive to me
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hi Alex..There is this course called 
*Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau offered by Duke University* would you recommend this to gain decent knowledge on Tableau before getting into data analyst job? Given a  month's time and Specialisation would be difficult to complete in it. Opinion please."
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hi just wondering after doing the databases and SQL for data science course, is this sufficient to be skilled in SQL (w everything I need to know). Any complementary courses that you will recommend"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Thank you Sir.
mLUzFXPPa4I,"For  a beginner, can you tell me by doing this Data Analysis and Presentation skills: the PwC approach Specialization  alone will it be suffice to study excel and presentation skills in a large scale . Or should we do any one of the courses for Excel separately before this specialization which you mentioned?"
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hi Alex, great content! how important is knowing the cloud like AWS, Azure etc for data analyst thanks."
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey Alex! What about the IBM Data Analyst Professional course? It teaches python, excel, cognos and much of what with the separate courses teach aside from the cloud services. I think it offers the convenience of all in one package and you would just learn cloud services on the side."
mLUzFXPPa4I,How about learning Tableau fro their own tableaulearning platform?
mLUzFXPPa4I,"I'm back because I am going HARD on this Data Analytics/Science thang.  Question,  I am seeing a lot people talking about  SQL using the MySQL RDBMS.  You talk specifically about SQL.  Am I selling myself short if I go for MySQL first?  It seems like a lot of people are leveraging MySQL and not using SQL as a stand alone.  I am slightly confused.  Thank you in advance for your great response 🙌"
mLUzFXPPa4I,What's different between Udemy & Coursera? 🤔
mLUzFXPPa4I,Great recommendations!!
mLUzFXPPa4I,"Hey Alex quick question, I am currently in a Finance program at my university and will be graduating in about a year and a half. Is it possible to land a job in Data Science with a bachelors in Finance if I learn the skills required (SQL, PowerBi, Tableu, Python,)? I would REALLY appreciate your insight. thanks! 😀"
mLUzFXPPa4I,Would you recommend taking Career Tracks on Data Camp?
XmFhpoS6Etk,Where are my 🍆🍆 people at?? 😂 (Watch to the end and you'll understand)
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆🍆🍆
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Hi Alex, love this podcast.  🍆Try to make a baingan bharta! Ya'll will love it, it's one of my favourite eggplant/brinjal dish, have it with some chapatis 🍆"

XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant it is...
The imposter syndrome is hard one Alex.. Really hard.."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"🍆🍆 I eat eggplant with egg omelet, but aside from that, I don't eat other meals or recipes with eggplants ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Thank you for your videos. technically, and emotionally, you've been a great help. I just moved away from a job I loved as an Electrical engineer to a startup IT service provider company because of how huge the pay difference is. I studied SQL on my own, and excel just by myself. I know I'm the best at my company, but when looking at qualifications, I dawned to me how much I still need to learn. This was even slapped on my face on my job interview where they said that they can't give my asking salary because there's more ""skillful"" analysts in their hiring pool. It felt so bad, but I pushed through with my confidence, and am now studying more. I know I will face imposter syndrome once I start working there next week, but your insights would be a huge help in making me think more logically about myself, my career, and my growth"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant!
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I have a data analyst interview tomorrow and I'm feeling a little imposter syndrome. I'm looking forward though brother, keeping my head up."
XmFhpoS6Etk,I really needed to hear this. I’ll be getting my Masters in DA at the end of this month (which I pursued after watching your videos and feeling inspired and encouraged) and have worked as an audit BA in finance for a couple years. I still battle imposter syndrome regularly and have to beat it back often. Came to revisit this as I apply for the DA jobs now to remind myself that I did the work and I will do great. Thanks for your encouragement it is much appreciated! 🙏🏽
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Hey Alex, I can only imagine how much struggle non-tech background people go through to get into tech roles and excel in them but I don't know exactly as I have the tech background. Hats off to all of you guys for following your passion and putting in a ton of effort to get into your dream job. All your videos are fully packed with the right kind of information. Thank you so much for putting in your efforts in creating such invaluable content and keep up the great work! 

May this chat look horrified as you wished, Alex  :) 🍆🍆🍆🍆"
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆thank you!
XmFhpoS6Etk,EGGPLANNTTT
XmFhpoS6Etk,Gracias por el topic de este video realmente lo necesitaba cuando escuché un anterior podcast tuyo que mencionaste el síndrome del impostor y me tocó un poquito el corazón porque no sabía cómo se llamaba y era lo que estaba sintiendo
XmFhpoS6Etk,Very Beneficial. Thank you Alex.
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant - thank for the video, very helpful"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Did you give any suggestions about how to get out of imposter syndrome? You just talked about yourself. Video was not informative at all. Your previous videos are same type as well. You are thinking only about how to earn money on youtube. You are not about giving information to people.
XmFhpoS6Etk,Thank you ❤
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I can’t believe the coincidence 😂😂😂

Last week (10 months after you made this video), I spent the whole week talking to my girlfriend about two things: 

1) Replacing our meat ingestion with things as eggplant 

2) How afraid I feel, because I am at the brink of getting a new job as a Data Analyst and I am transitioning from Civil Engineering, so I feel everyone is gonna be better than me. 

Thanks a lot for always taking the time to point out stuff that might be even more important than technical facts 🙏🏻"
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆🍆🍆
XmFhpoS6Etk,I thought eggplant was only for emojis these days?
XmFhpoS6Etk,Love you're efforts and dedication in providing quality content 🍆 -- Information systems student and data analyst intern and aspiring data scientist
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplants are amazingly versatile - knew a person once that had the ability to really find a thousand ways to make it a delight with every meal it was used in. 
On topic - it really hit home - in my domain I've organically grown into the company's Data/Business Analytics person and can attest to the impact it can have on your mental health thinking that you can't meet with the expectations presented."
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆 eggplant nothing else ha ha
XmFhpoS6Etk,Haha you said it yourself. Part of having imposter syndrome is thinking you're the only one who is an impostor. So why does it surprise you that more than half of people in the industry feel this way
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Man I’ve literally watched over 20 videos in 2 days, I just want to say THANK YOU(🍆 )lol"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"If you are feeling incompetent, just know that even Moses had imposter syndrome.

“And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?” - Eggxodus 3:11"
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Man, I am really starting to feel imposter syndrome now that Im graduated and job searching. Ill have to admit I started experiencing once I got into business school but I hope its not overbearing once I get my first position."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you for that episode.
Actually I didnt experience that yet. But I can imagine that people feel that way. Already while being in college I can't take myself seriously, thinking, if I'm succeeding in this, it means there must be a hook somewhere.

Now I'd like to ask you, after a few videos watched, what is the practical meaning of data analysis, what do you actually do and with which purpose?

And ""eggplant"" is the strangest vegetable name I know."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I believe having some level of this syndrome is healthy because it will keep people motivate to learn more to do their job even better. It will also make them feel more confident about job they occupy and salary they earn. In the mean time, having this high percentage of people having the imposter syndrome is partially because there are some bad players in the market. There are some recruiting service provider who lies to employers and create fake experiences in candidates resume, and some how successfully recruits people in data and IT related jobs. I am sure some of you have already hear or even had observation about some of these bad actors."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"This video was exactly what I needed right now! I just found your channel and I’m excited to watch more of your videos. Over the past 3+ years, an engineer at my small edtech company has helped me make the transition from marketing associate to data analyst. And now as the only person on our data team, I’m looking to make the move to a bigger company to grow my career even further (which comes with a lot of imposter syndrome)."
XmFhpoS6Etk,My whole life is an imposter syndrome :( happy i found your channel ☮️and ❤️.
XmFhpoS6Etk,Never feel bad about making comparisons...
XmFhpoS6Etk,"This is so motivating for beginners! Thank you a lot! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🍆 

I have completed 50% of my first online course on SQL: ‘Analize Data with SQL’ from CodeAcademyPro. 

I wanted to ask you the following: 
Although the course is for beginners, do you think I would be competent enough to start applying for (or even being accepted in) data analytics internships? 

In the course, I’m learning about: Manipulation, Queries, Calculating Aggregates, Joining Multiple Tables, Usage Funnels, User Churn, First and Last Touch Attribution Models, Window Functions. 

I also have a bachelors degree in finance (altho no internships performed during my uni years) so I have somewhat knowledge of statistics. 

My problem is that I don’t know if this is enough to start applying, at the same time, I maybe start/complete other online courses on the other skills I need (as could be Tableau, Python, R, etc. in which I have 0 knowledge), or should I, at least, get basic knowledge on all of that before stating applying ?? 

What do you think Alex? 

Thank you in advance anyways"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I'm in statistics field and most statistics jobs involves consulting for non statisticians. Although I will be graduating with masters degree, I feel like I have no idea how I will be the educator for others who even can be smarter than me like doctors and scientists (especially biostatistics). This can apply in any analytics field. But how can i gain the confidence as a consultant? My bachelor is not quantitative and I feel there's tons of information to learn. I got an interview and I felt like what? what did they see in me to call me for a job that requires 3 years experience and I have none? My imposter is so bad"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Some of my favorite memories are cooking eggplant parmigiana with my great aunt. What a process! 

Such a great topic, I've definitely felt Imposter Syndrome in the past and have been questioning myself as I start down this path if I even have what it takes to jump into DA as a 32 year old mom of 2, but I'm pushing through!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Pre covid, one of my favourite aubergine dishes is garlic bread with slices of aubergine on top. I only ate it when we went to a particular restaurant. Maybe I should make it at home. 🍕🍆❤  And thanks for the pep talk! 👍"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"What is your opinion on switching from Law to Data Analytics, I am currently taking Data Associate course in microsoft program. I can relate some stuff from Law to the Data Analytics, and I also have masters degree in finance and financial law, but never have worked with finance only with law part of that."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thanks a lot for talkin about these topics Alex! Keep up the good work, you deserve an eggplant"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant
XmFhpoS6Etk,Fantastic information- as a therapist I love that you are bringing to light the mental health/emotional aspect of this job 👍🏻
XmFhpoS6Etk,The spicy eggplants with minced pork in clay plot the cantonese style is one of my all time favorite dish. Thanks for sharing as always!! Always enjoy these long videos from your channel.
XmFhpoS6Etk,"2 minutes into the video, immediate Like just for learning this is an actual thing with a name. 
Fellow Imposters make me feel real.
This needs more viewssss"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Hey Alex, commend you for discussing this topic. Whether we admit or not, many people can relate to this at one time or another, including some of the most famous and richest people in the world. Our minds are usually the biggest battle we will ever have. Your honesty and sincerity is appreciated. Keep up the great work!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"This is so helpful! Thank you for addressing this issue.  I got my first DA job earlier this year, and it's hard shaking off the feeling of imposter syndrome.  Glad to know I'm not alone as well!

My favorite eggplant dish - grilled eggplant drenched in fish sauce!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant
XmFhpoS6Etk,Your fan from Mongolia!
XmFhpoS6Etk,here are your eggplant supporters ! ...Interesting topic. But to be honest there was a point I was about to give up...not sure about the reason but I was about to... But I know there is always a gem waiting at the end of the chapter...and yes...I got the prize ..It was about the question was made about the age of 44 to start becoming a DA. Really hopeful answer. Thanks for sharing you DA experience. Best

XmFhpoS6Etk,"Those that think that this is depressing are depressed and feel bad about themselves. Those of us that are not depressed, find this video uplifting. That's how I see it."
XmFhpoS6Etk,Awesome channel!  Nice to hear all your experiences and opinions :)
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Hey Alex,

First off 🍆 and thanks for all the info! Now I’m not sure how to feel about the fact that I got my weekly mental health dose from this channel 🤔 haha(jk, as a person who deals with this type of thoughts I really appreciate getting the perspective of someone who’s confident and successful).

Do you think DA knowledge can complement or  give a boost to careers in the ABA field (behavioral/special ed approach)? maybe when they reach a managerial position?

Thanks again!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I like eggplant, I actually eat it almost daily 🍆🍆"
XmFhpoS6Etk,do you have a Twitter account?
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I think I resonate with that, electrical engineer field, btw how to find a mentor in the field of data science /analyst? any recommendation?"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Hi Alex! I dicovered your channel this week and have been watching a TON of your videos this week. Really great stuff :D! I studied mechanical engineering and transitioned into a BI Analyst/Data Analyst/Data Engineer about a year ago only knowing basic SQL and Tabeau (I thought I was intermediate until I actually got a job XD) first 2 months were horrible cause I thought I knew everything I needed and it turned out I new next to nothing. I was determined to learn as quickly as I could on weekends and time off. In the end I didn't have to cause everything I learned, I learned doing the job and asking a TON of questions. My impostor syndrome finnaly went away when my boss asked me to teach the new intern on our team and realized how far I came from basically knowing very little. Also encouragements from my team saying I picked up things very quickly helped my confidence a lot. Love your videos and attitude! Greeting from Mexico and the eggplant team :D!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Fake it till you make it!!!!!
XmFhpoS6Etk,Can anybody else hear the crackling in the background?
XmFhpoS6Etk,I’m feeling like this for my first intern as a business analyst 😂
XmFhpoS6Etk,Thank you Alex for making content like this!  Your approach to making videos that are helpful and honest is refreshing compared to other channels on YouTube.
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant! You're extremely right about it being underrated (I love eggplant lol). Your video was very insightful, I feel like I learned more about this topic. Thank you, and keep up the good work! 🍆"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Some call it Baba Ghanoush other Baba ghanoub, in France it is also called caviar d’aubergine.
Bonne chance"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant 🍆 
I’m Italian from Milan but originally from Sicily. Sicilian cuisine uses a lot eggplants. You can do pasta or pizza “alla norma” style. My favorites. Check it out."
XmFhpoS6Etk,Fantastic video! I hope you’d appreciate our videos too! Let us know what you think and please have a blessed day! 🧚🏾‍♂️🌕
XmFhpoS6Etk,"You should try Baked Eggplant Fries, it is really good !🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆 The most underrated veg, I believe is Beetroot"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Do you know that a flock of Crow are call Murder LOL
XmFhpoS6Etk,commenting 'eggplant' to show how insightful I find your videos.
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Well actually where I come from  (Gujarat,India) I eat 🍆🍆🍆 3-4 times a week! Eggplant curry or Eggplant Bharta and recipes like that. Maybe you can try 😋"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Hey Alex, do what's right, don't be people pleaser. Kudos"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I share a similar experience coming from a non-technical/data background. The imposter syndrome was one of the biggest challenges I had to overcome when I transitioned from a high schoolteacher to a project officer then to a data analyst in my forties in a country which I had migrated to. The transition started because I was seen as being good with Excel which I was not as I was learning everything through Googling and was quite frankly ""faking it"" simply to solve a problem and get things done in the most efficient way by reducing manual repetitive data tasks. Although I am still using Excel, I have since moved on to SAS EG, Power BI and Tableau and have learnt SQL and R though I rarely have to use them in my work. So, without the depth of experience in coding, I am feeling like an impostor again. But hopefully it will go away one day once the institution's central data team phase out SAS and bring in a data reporting tool which requires some SQL coding 😅. I don't think I got the 🍆 thing but I like 🍆 in curry and grilled 🍆 with miso paste 😉"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Insightful episode, Alex! Will have to try out eggplant parm this month. Sounds good."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant I have a question. I am studying advanced SQL and started subqueries yesterday. How did you get a grasp on subqueries? I understand that it is a query inside another query and the the inner query runs first but when it comes to examples, I get a little stuck and there aren't alot of videos online about subqueries. Thank You!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I think I have what is opposite of imposter syndrome which is inferior complexity. I could be wrong as to the exact definition, but I consistently feel that I may never be good enough to get myself a good job. I tend to perceive myself as inferior to many people. I developed this when I was in the military. I went in at an older age (34) and everyone my age was either an officer or my superior. I began to suffer from depression and anxiety from the social isolation and feelings of loneliness and feelings of not being good enough or far enough in life.  Now having been three year's since I graduated with a master's degree in exercise science, I have yet to work a job that takes any sort of skill. Most the the jobs I have had the past three years are manual labor and retail jobs requiring nothing more than a high-school diploma. I am positive this is contributing to my worsening depression and anxiety along with inferior complexity. I now plan to begin an online master's program in analytics or AI and machine learning, I may end up doing both. I am hoping that by the time I graduate which will be around the age of 47 and having no domain experience, I can land my first data analyst job. I would hope to inspire other people who are in their mid 40s or older that it can be done even if you have worked none other than low-wage, low-skilled jobs. Besides my four years in the military, the most I have made in one year is around 19k. The day I do land a good job, I'll make sure to include some eggplant in my dinner! I thought I'd mention this. Things have been so bad as far as finding a job the past three years, that back in 2018 I filled out an application and sent a resume to work at McDonald's as a crew member! I never heard back! I doubt they have any thing related to eggplant on their menu. They could come up with the McEggplant burger or salad!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Thanks! I just got my first ever data analyst job... in fact I accepted the offer today. I’m so nervous about it. I really needed to hear this. I appreciate you and your videos. Keep them coming! (Except eggplants... those things are gross! 😂)
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I work as a data analyst for a fortune 10 health care organization (maybe we work for the same company) within a business segment of our company that focuses on behavioral health data....so I am used to working with therapist and psychiatrist so the ""touchy feely"" topic feels normal to me. I also have an Associates in Business Admin and a BA in Healthcare Admin that I earned while with the company but most of the people on my team are folks with engineering and computer science degrees, I sometimes to have TECH impostor syndrome BUT I will say that I know that I have much more knowledge of the healthcare and business side that than my teammates so this is how I reconcile the impostor syndrome myself."
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆 ! Love the video
XmFhpoS6Etk,"If I’m honest on my resume, and a company hires me, The message I receive is they are telling me I’m good enough to do the job.  I also try to keep my confidence high by continuing to develop my skills.  I think a contributing factor to imposter syndrome is the belief that people are better than you or know more, which often times isn’t the case"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you for speaking about this topic. I am going through a similar situation. I am looking for a job and I feel I am no good compared to other candidates after facing rejections. 
I am not a naturally confident person, so I need external validation for my skills as I can get very self-critical sometimes. 
Edit : typos"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant gang. I don't want to feel good about other people feeling insecure and stressed, but knowing that 58% of people out there in the field feel the same way I do when I see an entry level job that asks for 3-5 years of experience makes me feel better and more confident about just going for it and applying."
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Did you try the ""escabeche"" eggplant?

“Escabeche” Eggplant
Ingredients
 
3 large eggplants (about 2.2 lb)
3 tablespoons Himalayan pink salt (or regular granny salt)
2 cups of white vinegar
1 cup of water
1 cup of Olive oil
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
1/2 tablespoon of Paprika
1/2 tablespoon of chili flakes
1/2 tablespoon of oregano
2 bay leaves
1 cup of sunflower oil, it may be more or less


Marinated ""Escabeche"" Eggplant by Sigrilina -- This is a great way to preserve eggplants and to infuse them with flavor.
Preparation
Step 1 Peel the eggplant and cut in 3/8 inch slices.
Step 2 Put the eggplant in a bowl and mix thoroughly with the Himalayan pink salt. Let it rest for 30 minutes.
Step 3 In a pot mix the vinegar with the water, set aside.
Step 4 Rinse the eggplant slices.
Step 5 Cook the eggplant in the vinegar-water mixture for 2 or 3 minutes or until they have acquired the hardness of your liking. Check on them often as they tend to be very hard and then to soft quite quickly.
Step 6 Drain the eggplant and set aside.
Step 7 In a small bowl mix the olive oil with the spices and the bay leaves.
Step 8 In a sterilized jar, alternate eggplant and the oil mixture. Remember to put the bay leaves in between.
Step 9 When you are done, cover the rest of the jar with sunflower oil until the eggplants are fully covered.
Step 10 Before consumption let rest for at least one week in the refrigerator so the eggplants are really infused with the flavor.
Step 11 Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.

You can add it to a sandwich or maybe as an appetizer .
Great videos!"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Eggplant! You’re right eggplants are underrated. I’ve been loving the show so far. I’m currently an audit underwriter for a major insurance company with a B.A in Finance. (Graduated in 2018) but there are little opportunities to go the financial analyst route right now so I’m stuck. With that said, I’m going back to get an MBA in business data analytics to hopefully merge my experience with finance to  data  analytics. Your channel has been a great help"
XmFhpoS6Etk,eggplant yo!
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Yes, The Eggplant lasagna is so good. Nice video Alex 👌"
XmFhpoS6Etk,🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
XmFhpoS6Etk,this was insightful thank you
XmFhpoS6Etk,"It's tricky though, right? It's imposter syndrome om one end (feeling you're not good enough) and the feeling you're too big of a fish in your pond on the other. Or is this an eggplant kind of reasoning? Perhaps the first is a better problem to have? I must be wrong, but not sure where."
XmFhpoS6Etk,could you please make a video on masters in USA on data analytics and eventually settle there as DAta analyst or Data engineer. And good Universities and stuff
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Really great video, Alex. Can you explain the difference between data analysis and data science some time?"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"""I need you to use your skills to recommend to me a multi-million dollar company move""

me: ....""I need an adult! SOS!"""
XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant yo!
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you again, Alex! This topic is very important and only few people openly talk about this. I really needed to hear this from someone who's already in the industry. I'm not there yet but I already feel the anxiety but I feel better hearing this from you. 🍆🍆🍆"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Thanks for your honesty. I'm a person that doesn't mind the truth usually it hurts but it must be said. I am interviewing for a junior data analyst role next Wednesday so I'm definitely feeling a little imposter syndrome but trying to be as confident as you are and remember the list you mentioned. Definitely will be re-watching some of your other videos as part of my prep. Thanks. Eggplant. 🍆🍆🍆
XmFhpoS6Etk,"OMG!!! this is something awesome,, today itself I came to know that I face with imposter syndrome and in 6 hours here the video is"
XmFhpoS6Etk,Eggplant! 🍆 It's funny I made a comment in that other video about imposter syndrome and you made a video about it! I''m actually surprised that imposter syndrome isn't something you can overcome by simply becoming better at your job
XmFhpoS6Etk,"Thank you Alex, i watch all of your videos and always stick to the end, keep going, and this is my present to you for today 🍆🍆"
XmFhpoS6Etk,"I currently going back to school not hoping to change career but to incorporate more advance data analytics skills set to my current career beyond just excel. Your videos have been very helpful for me so far so thanks a lot! Anyway, imposter syndrome is real for me because I moved up the rank too quickly and mostly due to luck (promotion were available at locations that no one wants to relocate to and I was willing to). After a few promotions and finally relocated to a city I want to live in, I definitely feel  that I definitely should not have this job and always paranoid that I will be fired at every single one on one with my boss. So far no bad news yet but it is crazy how the feeling devalue your work. Sometimes I would accomplish something and always think that ""anyone could have done that."""
1xT68oeQTd0,Is Coding required for Data analyst role ?
1xT68oeQTd0,thank you. I love your videos.... Do you think that this career is good for working remotly?
1xT68oeQTd0,"I really like your videos, but to be honest I find the infinite cuts at the beginning of just about every sentence to be quite jarring and off-putting. I know you are trying to be concise and high-energy, but dang - it comes off as choppy, frenetic, and exhausting (for me).  Just my two cents worth- from someone who is far less talented than yourself, so take what I say with a grain of salt. But I did have to stop the video and come up for air as I simply could not watch you spring back to life like an android at (CUT- SPRING TO LIFE!) the next sentence."
1xT68oeQTd0,"Thank you for such insightful information. As someone who's looking to start a career in this field, your channel has proven to be very helpful. Thank you so much!"
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hey Alex. I have completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering in India. Then I started working as a Python Developer for 2 years. Currently I migrate to London and I am pursuing Masters in Data Science. My master’s course length is 1 year. Many people told me that this 1 year Master’s Degree wont be standout in front of those who have 2 year Masters Degree course. So, my question is that does my 1 year Masters Degree won’t be in consideration compared to others who have 2 year Masters Degree ?"
1xT68oeQTd0,Would be so interesting and cool if you do a day in the life of a business analyst video
1xT68oeQTd0,It’s was short and crisp video . Wanna watch more of these .
1xT68oeQTd0,"if you have to choose 2 tools, which one do you choose ? (Excel, Python, Power BI, Tableau, SQL) ?"
1xT68oeQTd0,"You mentioned Python, Is R slowly fading away from the market?"
1xT68oeQTd0,Is there a course/certification you recommend for a beginner who wants to learn data science
1xT68oeQTd0,"Tableau is shit BI platform.
I am myself a BI Architect and would never Tableau. And those who even say Power BI is good, do not even know what BI is.
SQL, Python or R, either one of these is must. At least SQL basics, since majority of DB's are SQL based."
1xT68oeQTd0,You may end up doing LEFT JOINs and RIGHT JOINs all day long....
1xT68oeQTd0,Can data analysts potentially make millions? I know income shouldn’t be the main reason you choose a job but I’m curious to see if that’s a possibility. I’m a high school senior and I’m looking at different career paths and data analytics definitely came to mind.
1xT68oeQTd0,"I'm facing difficulties in programming, wht topics  should I rely on python & R
Plz reply..."
1xT68oeQTd0,"my first DA job was great it was 99% data cleaning and creating visuals in PowerBI i got this job by chance after pivoting careers, sadly it was a contract. 2nd job was a high pressure operations analytics job and boy was it 99% prep work all in excel - eventually changed it all to Python but did I break a lot on the way. Learning what to touch and what not to touch is a skill in of it self."
1xT68oeQTd0,"I am learning data analysis with python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. Do these people also get paid the similar amount or they are different since they are more technical? Please share some thoughts, thanks in inadvance."
1xT68oeQTd0,My mini player was on so I just saw your bald head and thought you are Jeff Bezos. But when I scrolled down I saw that you are just other bald guy.
1xT68oeQTd0,1. being bald
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hey, if u know a lot about statisticians, would you be able to do a video on what statisticians do in their daily work life? Thanks"
1xT68oeQTd0,"I just recently started to learn SQL and python with an app. I haven't tiped these stuff into YouTube. Seems like my other app gave data to this one and recommend me this video.
I appreciate it but it's also a little creepy.🤔"
1xT68oeQTd0,im studyng bachhlor degree of data scientist and its my first year .. its a 3 year course . so can tell ME  the future prospects of these fields and yOur opinion about the salary after 3  yEARS
1xT68oeQTd0,"Thanks Alex. This is great.i could relate to the pain of data consolidation & cleansing.

Keep going. If possible, please do something on the learning process.

I mean, MOOCs vs on the job vs practice etc. How you believe someone could build the different competencies"
1xT68oeQTd0,"I'm a simple man. I watch your videos, and instantly hit the like button. 😂
I'm brazilian and have a bachelor's degree in production/industrial engineering. I've worked as analyst before and I'm actually trying to change career into Data analytics - only used Excel and VBA for my whole life.

Mr Alex, do you know if there are companies that hire international employees to work remotely?

Last but not least, your videos have been amazing me so far! Its great to see how direct and helpful you are, I wish you and your family the very best!"
1xT68oeQTd0,I've just been watching this vid because you are so f*ing handsome.
1xT68oeQTd0,"The first meeting of (almost) every major data project I complete features some variation of ""these numbers are wrong.""  We always have to loop back through a data correction/data cleanse process and it's important to build in time for this.  Learning how to identify engaged users and then get them to spend time testing can also be a key skill."
1xT68oeQTd0,"Wow i love how quick and specifc you made this, most youtubers just desperately try to fill those 10 mins"
1xT68oeQTd0,Just found your channel gonna check it out good info here thanks! What level of education do you have Alex? I am a looking to get into the field but have a BA in business and am taking a course on corsera from IBM to get my feet wet!
1xT68oeQTd0,Viva R Nation!)))
1xT68oeQTd0,"The reality is Data Scientists are likely to steal all the Data Analysts jobs because they know ""statistical analysis"" better
The only thing Data Analysts know better is business knowledge."
1xT68oeQTd0,RIP my Scala skills    ｡･ﾟﾟ･(>д<)･ﾟﾟ･｡
1xT68oeQTd0,Can you elaborate on how one can create a portfolio without formal experience?
1xT68oeQTd0,hello Alex I’m actually getting my master in data analytics and I m currently in the insurance industry what are some good career options?
1xT68oeQTd0,"See that interests me I’m a dev, if you spend 50-70% of your time cleaning the data. All that can be done with code. In fact once the process is setup, you should never need to do it again. You could save the vast majority of your time."
1xT68oeQTd0,70% is just fire SQL queries to a database which is completely garbage and in the 1NF or 2NF and you are the only one who understands that mountain of trash
1xT68oeQTd0,"I'm in an IT role where all I do is SQL, Excel, and Crystal Reports for the most part. I'm not a Data Analyst, more like a business analyst type of role. I enjoy working with data a lot, but being in front of a computer all day everyday is brutal. I really enjoy working with people too. I'm so lost"
1xT68oeQTd0,"correct, latest technologies not needed, but some could boost productivity while others are traps"
1xT68oeQTd0,"“What is my purpose?”

“You clean data”

“....oh my god”

Learned that shit the hard way but I don’t exactly hate what I do...most of the time"
1xT68oeQTd0,"I am from Germany and recently graduated and got my Bachelors of Engineering in international industrial engineering and management (it sound way better in German lol) and I realized that I would like to get more into computer science, especially Data Science. 

My question is: Is Data Analysis part of Data Science ? What is the difference of being a Data Scientist and and a Data Analyst ? 
I also looked at some online courses and they all contain libraries like Pandas, Numpy etc but also stuff like Spark, Tensorflow and so on. If you do not use Spark as a Data Analyst, in which job would you use it? I am bit confused lol"
1xT68oeQTd0,"Been poking around at potential job prospects on the market and I’m technically qualified for a number of these jobs but I am not sure if somebody in my position is technically qualified for data analyst jobs. 
I’ve got a Master’s in Political Science (with a heavy quantitative focus). I am good with and have plenty of experience in STATA and R and a variety of statistics techniques and models. My transcript demonstrate numerous stats/math courses. But I don’t technically have the degree I feel like employers give preference to. Heck, I might not even have the skills. I guess I’m just wondering, with my background, if I really have a chance at data analyst positions and, if not, what I can do to fix this? Thank you for the video!"
1xT68oeQTd0,dude! thanks for the advice!
1xT68oeQTd0,"SQL + Excel. Truly master those and everything else is gravy. Get data > Scrub Data > Make it usable for the layman > Tell them what it means and be prepared to repeat. I hit Senior DA this year with about 8 years experience and these two skills, more than anything else got me there. 100k salary in a small city."
1xT68oeQTd0,"Crime Analyst here. Scrubbing data, prep etc is *at least* 70% where I am. Cops aren't data entry specialists and everything that's supposed to go into their respective fields goes into the narrative supplement, and the fields I've asked to make mandatory, IT has been sitting on for two years so far. I'm making visualizations, products and analyses based on data I can't enter, verify, edit or quality control. ""Data"" in my job means reading through stories written by people who aren't writers and who don't care about analysis."
1xT68oeQTd0,I’m a senior data analyst. Docker and docker compose are crucial and adds tons of flexibility for spinning up full stack apps (like plotly dashboards) rather quickly.
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hey Alex, I was wondering if you could suggest me if I should go for a yellow belt six sigma certification with 1.5 years of workex in Business/Data Analytics field?

Love you videos"
1xT68oeQTd0,"I have been away from I.T field for a very long time and wanting to come back to it, your video are really helpful. Thanks"
1xT68oeQTd0,Its so true👍
1xT68oeQTd0,Thank you
1xT68oeQTd0,"""How to get a real life data analysis experience without a job""  such a video will be very appreciated"
1xT68oeQTd0,WHAT ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING
1xT68oeQTd0,Just discovered this channel. Plan to check out more so thanks for the content! I'm finishing my PhD in psychological research and only now realised I don't want to do academia anymore. Hoping I can move to data analysis in the industry but so far only know R (and SPSS but that's just a dying program). Ppl tell me a PhD should still make me highly employable cuz I have the stats skills but I worry undergrads with computer science degrees will still look more favourable😓 if you see this comment I'd be interested to know your stance.
1xT68oeQTd0,Can you go over the different levels of being an analyst (entry level vs. mid level vs. senior level)
1xT68oeQTd0,"Is this video discouraging me from studying data science , I am 18 now and just enrolled in IIT madras online BSc degre program in programming and data science"
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hi Alex! Do you know how much is the average salary in Europe as a Data analyst? And is it possible and regular to work official in an other country but do my work from home, which is in an other country? I mean to work for a Swiss company from my home in Germany for example."
1xT68oeQTd0,Thank you and great insights Alex! Would love a video on how to build a portfolio based on skills and skill level.
1xT68oeQTd0,How common is using R?
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hi Alex, I am from india(2 years experience in service based company) and looking to do 1 year Masters in DAta analytics/science in the US and find a job there , is it worth investing thousands of dollars in for masters, considering return of investment and career growth as well. If it is worth can you suggest me some good universities and even proper masters degree ( like there are MSc/MS in data analytics/data science for 1 year/2 years).I am interested to work as Data analyst and grow to data engineer after some solid experience
Even you may make a video on that, that would be great.Basically considering all important factors such as Tution fee, Time and growth and hike on salary."
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hey Alex, 
Thanks again for sharing your experience with us, I personally think it's good to know a lot about all the tools you mentioned to get a job in a very competitive market.
I am a Junior in Computer Information Systems at Cal Poly Pomona with emphasis in B.I.
My priority is to learn Excel, SQL, Tableau and a programming language such as R or Python."
1xT68oeQTd0,"Its true, the majority of the time is spent gathering requirements and on data wrangling and data munging.  I do with wish I spent more time on data visualization, analysis and story telling."
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hey,
Can you give a detailed video on what to learn first, second, third, etc to be a data analyst?

Because I'm really confused on what to start from
Currently learning python and SQL
I just want to know the basics while understanding what I'll do as a data analyst, then when I'm very aware of the kind of things I'll be doing in a job.. then I can further my knowledge in learning alot in other areas..

I don't have bootcamps in my country..
If only I can get like a curriculum to follow.
Can you do that as a video? 🥺"
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hey Alex, great video as always! Can you make a video explaining about the terms used in data analytics/BI job postings and what are the best strategies to adjust the resume to meet those requirements?"
1xT68oeQTd0,"how did you handle getting stuck with an unforeseen problem on the job? For example, how did you figure out how to clean complex data sets with several missing values or human data entry errors if you had never dealt with it before?"
1xT68oeQTd0,Can People without full time work experience get jobs in Business Analyst and Data analyst field.
1xT68oeQTd0,"Hi Alex, when will you host a Q&A session?"
1xT68oeQTd0,Thank you very much for telling the true side of data analytics. Is there chances of using Python and Pandas as the process of creating data visualizations?
1xT68oeQTd0,"Can get a job by udacity courses??
Thanks fo helpful ❤️"
1xT68oeQTd0,"Can you compare Google Sheets and Excel.
By the way love your content. 
Thank you."
1xT68oeQTd0,"thanks a lot Alex , you really a good director who lead us as we are new  in data analysis field"

eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Interesting facts about Cabbage

1. Ancient roots. Cabbage has been cultivated for longer than almost any other vegetable on record. To be precise, more than 6,000 years! It originated in Shensi Province, China, sometime around 4,000 B.C.

2. Elixir for Baldness. In ancient China (roughly 1000 B.C.) scrolls touted cabbage as a magic cure-all for bald men. It’s hard to say if there’s any truth in this claim, but no one can deny cabbage is chock full of nutrients that promote good health.

3. Vitamin C Galore. Cabbage contains a high concentration of Vitamin C. That means it cuts out toxins in your body, preventing skin disease, arthritis, and rheumatism. Go for red cabbage when you have Vitamin C in mind. It contains double the content of regular green cabbage."

Hi Alex, this is me again watching today's video.... Another of my goals, besides changing career to data analyst and finding a job on June, is to find an English language based job, and hopefully emigrating from my country. I'm thinking of Mexico where I am at the moment... the struggle though is that to be able to work in another country there are always a lot of legal things you have to get that I think might not be easy.

But, at the same time, with all this ""remote work"" revolution since COVID, I have a theory that maybe I can find a remote job, in English, without the need of work permits, etc. and just travel while I work. Do you think this is a real possibility?, I think you are not an immigrant so probably don't have a lot of experience working in another countries, but do you have any insight, or advice on this?... maybe from the ""company hiring immigrants"" position?"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,cabbage 🥬 😊 another fantastic talk! hope you and your family are doing well!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,My cabbages!! :'D
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Yes I'm seeing this so late but this was heartfelt and personal. I enjoyed this. 👍❤
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage rocks!! And data analytics too!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage. Is there a 2021 update to this?
eTsHJoMmhYQ,CABBAGE
eTsHJoMmhYQ,I wonder what his MBTI is
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage kimchi is always a great side dish w/ rice.
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Yes I love cabbage too. We consume a ton of cabbage in Jamaica as well lol
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage! Interesting analysis of how Covid has impacted the job market...
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Hello Sir,
I have a query...since you told its gonna be tough for a fresh college graduate to get into data analytics...can you suggest which job role(that  are related or similar to data analyst) to look out for...
P.S I have been applying since three months...not getting any interview calls.
Thanks in advance."

eTsHJoMmhYQ,cabbage!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage
eTsHJoMmhYQ,As a new grad it’s been really tough trying to find a job while I’m working as an intern. I hate this :(
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage 🤣
eTsHJoMmhYQ,will not support you on patreon until you get Trumps Bobble-head ! cabbage !!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"You should make a video on cabbage 🥬 because I necessarily am not convinced more of a brussel sprout guy myself. Make a visual of the top vegetables domestically and internationally. Anyways, how would you explain a gap in work experience because during the COVID situation it has been difficult to find a job so much so it's been years and others months since they've had work?"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Cabbage!! I really love cabbage with corn beef!! 
Yeah it's really tough landing a data analyst position right now. I'm in a career change so that makes it tougher but I'm finding ways to keep myself optimistic keep learning more programming languages and creating more projects that I can put on my resume. There are bad days when I feel that I should give up but I keep hope by watching videos like yours and building more skills.  Let's all hope us aspiring data analyst will land the job they desire."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"One thing I woul like to ask does data science really play significant role in company are they really important 
If companies aren't getting much benifit from data scientist then the might fire them"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Love you sir
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Cabbage 
Love your videos."

eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Hey Alex, could a biostatistician transit to data analyst or data scientist fields?"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,I love cabbage! My husband doesn't tho
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Don't be so hard on yourself! These are great ! Like cabbages 

Sorry for the pressure chamber, we all need our own space from time to time ! 

Exercise has been my saving grace during covid

Update: starting the IBM data analytics course today
And added all the courses I've taken so far to my LinkedIn , are you on there ?

What kind of work do data analysts do in Entertainment? I'm also a artist so I feel like that would be the best fit for me"

eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Cabbage is good because it goes with Corned Beef!! And, it helps you loose weight!!  I am using this down time to level up my skills!! I actually enrolled in two of the classes that you recommended in an earlier video!!  (SQL and Python) Thanks for the content!!"

eTsHJoMmhYQ,Thanks for all the info! I hope you get to have some cabbage today 😁
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"I was in the United States up until July 2020, as an international student, and the job market plundered as the cases progressed. For someone like me, fresh out of college, in a different country, and looking for a career in data analytics, everything came crashing down as time progressed. I had no choice but to come back to India and try my hand in the Indian market, which again, has had similar outcomes. I came across your youtube channel and your course recommendations, and I just went ahead and started all over again. It is safe to say that I am making progress, though I haven't landed a job. But the bottom line is that I AM MAKING PROGRESS. And some credit goes to you as well, Sir! Thank you for inspiring me.
P.S.: I loved the Barrak Obama on your laptop."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Thanks for answering my question!!!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"🥬.. I agree with you, with the situation of working from home and having the kids 24/7.. I am on the same boat!!"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabb to the age
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"The job market is a steaming pile of cabbage. I’ve got 4 years experience in sports analytics, but I’ve only gotten 9 job interviews in the last 6 months since my lay off. Feels like employer expectations for candidates are sky high because they know they have their pick of the litter. I’m sick of the gaslighting too. I legitimately didn’t get one job after 4 rounds of interviews because the manager thought “I have been unemployed for too long already.”  

You were definitely right that most companies are not that open to Remote, and the ones that say they are are still expecting you to relocate. Most of the local companies to me are in hiring freezes. I’m really not sure what I’m going to do. I think there was maybe like 5 jobs I could even realistically apply to all of last month. I’d be shocked if I got a new job before a vaccine was readily available and more companies can start lifting their hiring freezes."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage yo!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Cabbage.

Thank you Alex for this episode."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,I'm an Asian and I love cabbage.
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage! 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Oh, right.. I see what you're doing. Cabbage has more of a support role among veggies, just like Data Analysts do within their companies.
Side note: there's something in your teeth."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,🥬 CABBAGE 🥬
eTsHJoMmhYQ,@Alex. Can you post the most asked interview computer coding assessment for  healthcare data analyst. pls
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Hey Alex do you think cover the topic of the order in which skills you should learn first as a data analyst , in terms of self learning ?"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Fried cabbage is so underrated.
And yes , as someone trying to land a data analyst job right out of college, it's been very difficult. I keep hearing the market is getting better but i'm not even landing interviews. Soon enough though!"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage 🥬 Great show! Makes me nervous to go out looking for a job starting in February but at least the amount of remote jobs available are increasing and that’s how I would like to begin my journey. Thanks for the info!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"I am Asian, I love CABBAGE and yes, CABBAGE is AMAZING."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Hey Alex, how you doing? CABBAGE 🥬"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Showing my love for cabbage xD thanks for this video. And yeah, that 'remote Dallas' position was lame."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Nice Video like Cabbage
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Cabbage! Everyone asks ""Alex, how can I get a data analyst job?"" But few or no one asks how is Alex doing.

On another note, I'm surprised you don't use/mention SAS given that you work in healthcare and are a pro at SQL."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Cabbage !!!!
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Great video! I'm just shy of 3 years into Data Analytics, now in the market again... it's definitely not easy right now. Certainly doable, just gotta keep trying :)"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"Why do you always say negative about these careers?

Please tell something positive which can motivate people like me who are transiting towards data science from electrical engineering."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"this experience can be summed up as: biggest dumpster fire

normally, wasn't an issue. data jobs were the fastest growing jobs of 2015-2020 until the market took a huge nose dive. now you have people with senior level experience applying to junior level jobs as well as PhDs with who knows what kind of experience. Lots of people are not only graduating and applying to these roles, but a lot of analysts lost their jobs. 

So now data jobs are in a huge predicament. If the market doesn't recoil back to equilibrium, companies are going to want even MORE experience than what they already want! I'm seeing 3 years experience needed, and some companies want 5! For entry! 

No...I'm not salty about it..."
eTsHJoMmhYQ,I agree I love CABBAGE ! I love the crunch as well
eTsHJoMmhYQ,I can confirm as a recent college grad it is difficult to get a job and I been at it for about 2 months
eTsHJoMmhYQ,Hahaha. Blackberry cobbler helped you polishing up!! That was hilarious😂😂
eTsHJoMmhYQ,"First to here! Alex I love your videos and I am so upset to see the job descriptions these days. Data Analyst requirements are crazy like Sql worth 5 years of experience, 3+ years of python experience with numpy, jupyter and pandas notebooks. Tensor flow, writing machine learning algorithms , then knowledge about visualization tools like SAS, Tableau and PowerBI etc

What is going on?"
eTsHJoMmhYQ,first view :)

8SolrjsGqzE,"Avocado🤭🤭🤭
Thank you for this!

I started out wanting to be a data scientist (I had no idea what I was doing 😂)
Then along the way, I realised Data Analytics is probably going to be easier for me to break into seeing as I’m a nurse 
I started with learning python and switching to learn SQL is really proving difficult 😢
So I think I’m just going to master python first before moving to SQL and the rest"

8SolrjsGqzE,Do you have a roadmap for self learners so that we don’t miss out on topics and bounce around and get mixed up?

8SolrjsGqzE,"Thanks for sharing your insights. I'm in my early 50s, and 3 years ago stumbled into a Business Intelligence Developer position. I love it; wish I'd known the world of data analytics existed decades ago. Now, I'm faced with the reality that my career has never been linear.  It's taken many twists and turns with different skillsets, including primarily focused on raising kids for 15 years.  

In my current position, I am  the most knowledgeable in the company and100% self taught by reading books, online courses, etc. This is meant to boast, it's actually a somewhat sad reality. It's frustrating not having anyone to talk to with more advanced skills than myself to know if I'm approaching projects the ""right"" way. 

I look at postings for other jobs specific to my skillset (Power BI) and based on my actual experience with the tool, I can't even find anything that isn't entry level that's paying anywhere near what I'm currently making.

I've been sitting on the fence on whether or not to pursue a master's and frankly, this video helped cement the fact I really don't have a choice if I want to advance my career.  I can't get in 10 years of experience with the expectation I having an additional 20 years to work."
8SolrjsGqzE,Avocado. 😊
8SolrjsGqzE,Avocado 🥑🤣🤣
8SolrjsGqzE,"Avocado, I took the route of self taught because i just graduated as an accountant and realized i won't get paid well while working the whole day.

8SolrjsGqzE,"I think the information you provided on boot camps and the format  was very helpful!

Although, it might just be because you mentioned health care and I just graduated with a double masters in public policy and public health ;-). I found you because of your tableau tutorials and they were so much better than the college course I took! I know you prefer Python, but I would love to see you do tutorials in R because that one was been horrendous for me to learn."
8SolrjsGqzE,Avocado! I am so glad I have followed the advice to watch your channel! I am also thinking of making a career switch from healthcare and your videos are very helpful and encouraging!

Since then I've been learning all the required skills for a data analyst and I'm really enjoying it. I'm more applied now (even with a full time job) than I've ever been my hole life.

My objective is to get a DA job here in Brazil, when the timing is right (I need to put the salary gap into account, short and long term). 
For the future, my goal is to get a job in another country, since I've always wanted to live abroad.

Thanks for all. Best wishes."

As you cannot get a job right away which you need to see."

8SolrjsGqzE,"Structure! Have a goal, have motivation,  create a step by step flow of study ."
8SolrjsGqzE,"Bootcamp on a new level of confidence says if you don't get a job then you don't have to pay. So its a win win for the learner. You walk away with the knowledge and experience. So, the best fit is self learning alongside bootcamp. Success on every level is directly proportional to the amount of work you put in to it. If you are a career rejoiner/changer/.....you should definitely self learn alongside bootcamp. If for nothing, structure,networking,mentorship....

SKsjWzzz4mY,"It’s unlikely that any one person will like/be good at all of these! I personally don’t love documentation, but I do understand the importance of it. (I do like everything else though 😁) 

So if you don’t hit all of these boxes don’t worry!"
SKsjWzzz4mY,I do definitely wanna be a Data analyst but I don't necessarily have a background in maths so what can I do if i wanted to go into data Analyst.
SKsjWzzz4mY,"You mention collaboration with other teams & colleagues, so my question is: What other teams do you work with most frequently?"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"I’m not kidding, the first three I was like, ‘nope!’  Next I was like, ‘yes’. I love being the ‘excel guy’ at work and love data and working with it. But I’m not a fix-it guy and I’m not the ‘super organised’ type. I’m left wondering whether or not this is for me. 
What can I do to further explore?
I don’t want to write off a possible career that I might love. 

From your videos comparing data analyst to business analyst or data scientist, I definitely had my suspicions confirmed that data analyst was what I had in mind for what I wanted. 

It’s the whole, ‘build dashboards and create reports’ thing...that’s what I think I would love and be good at (based on the small exposure I’ve had at different times in my job)"
SKsjWzzz4mY,Does data analyst need knowledge or certificate or both can u tell it
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hi Alex, if someone dislike mathematics but interested in data analyst job, is it alright?"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hey Alex, I have learned almost everything I need to know in excel and started on VBA on recently. Would you recommend learning it? Or will SQL and python be enough?"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"0:19 you like solving problems 
1:05 you're organized and structured 
1:45 you're a self learner who enjoys learning new skills 
2:09 you're good with people and enjoy collaborating 
2:44 you enjoy building and coding"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"With office jobs being transformed to remote work, should data analysts be worried about being outsourced?"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hey Alex :)
I just came across your channel while surfing in search of data analysis/science. I like programming but I'm confused about my position. I think I'll do well in data analytics and I'd like to explore this arena. But as a newbie idk where to start ! Could you help me please ? Like recommending a course? It'll be of great help sir. Appreciate the efforts you put in your videos :)
Also, would you recommend Udemy or Coursera ?


Edit: I like identifying patterns, solving coding questions which are based on patterns and all. I like keeping everything organized (idk why I said that). I think it'll be a good path for me"
SKsjWzzz4mY,Congrats on 10k dude. I've been watching you from 1k. Keep the good content coming!
SKsjWzzz4mY,I'm glad i found your videos
SKsjWzzz4mY,Hey mr alex can i have your contact sir whatsapp no we need to talk i’m james from. Tanzania
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Another great video Alex!!!! I start my journey in the data analyst world thanks to you, in a couple of years I hope we could meet... Keep uploading new videos, truly enjoy the videos man, they feel authentic... Keep the great work going !!!"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"I'm in my final year as an Econ major
I have actually been interested in programming and I know the basics.

Do I need to get a masters in CS or just self learn?"
SKsjWzzz4mY,Sir how we contact you
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hi Alex, just discovered your channel. Really enjoying your videos. Thanks for making these. 

I fit many of these qualities, like I like learning, coding/programming and understanding statistics and economics/business, I like organizing things. But one thing I’m concerned about is my attention to detail, sometimes I do make careless mistakes. I’m trying to work on it. But I’m not sure if this is a dealbreaker. Love to hear what you think?"
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hey Alex, I am a professional digital marketer. And I would love my work. But recently, my interest also arise in data analysis and data visualization, which overall hell me in marketing too! 

So, I am eagerly wanted to learn data analysis. But I don't know from where to start, because on internet too many different things available. 

I wantted to some one guide to start step  by step. 

Can you help me with the same and  want to start complete scratch.

Note: My programming is sucks."
SKsjWzzz4mY,"With your videos i am thinking about data analysis now, thank you :)"
SKsjWzzz4mY,Glad you are feeling better. Got through Mosh's 3-hr SQL video and took detailed notes. Moving down your recommended list for free resources. I WILL become a Data Analyst next year.
SKsjWzzz4mY,Thanks Alex
SKsjWzzz4mY,Couldn't agree with number 1 more.  You really need to have a natural sense of curiosity to succeed in the field.  I'd add onto number 4: written communication.  Particularly since COVID I've seen a lot of previously face-to-face interaction turn into text and those with good writing skills could really take advantage of that!
SKsjWzzz4mY,Please Alex the analyst can I get to have a one on one chat with you.
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hi Alex, thanks for the video, it's very useful! 🙂 I just found your channel couple a days ago and I really enjoy it. As someone who's interested in becoming Data Analyst, I find it quite awesome 🙂 I have a question for you: can you make a video of a typical project Junior Data Analysts could work on? I think there are a lot of people who would like to see the workflow and how you implement your ideas. I'm familiar with the software that Data Analysts use, it's just that I'm not quite sure about the responsibilities and obligations one could have (how do you gather data, how do you organize it, what do companies usually expect, etc.)...
Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us all! Best of luck in the future!"
SKsjWzzz4mY,Thanks for this video! I can not wait the next one!
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Wow, that sounds like a lot of work! lol Do people who have all of these 5 traits mastered exist? It feels like you are combining 3 jobs (engineer, researcher, sales) into 1. I can't image someone not feeling like an impostor in such a role"
SKsjWzzz4mY,does google hire data analysts??
SKsjWzzz4mY,Great video! thanks
SKsjWzzz4mY,aww now you make me want to stay in DA instead of moving to DE
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Hello Alex, hope you are doing great, I have a question, In your opinion how long it takes to become a good data analyst for someone who is good in statistics, excel, beginner in programming and know the basics of SQL, python and tableau."
SKsjWzzz4mY,"#6: you're okay with someone coming to you frantically about an issue that'll melt the whole world down, when in reality it's needing to change a date format with like 2 clicks."
SKsjWzzz4mY,"I am building my first ""Certified"" data source for where I work and brining in documentation really helped the DBAs appreciate the work I put in to make it easier to hand off to them.  Also, it got the turnaround sliced in half.  So happy you brought up documenting your work."
SKsjWzzz4mY,I even call myself The Problem Solver
SKsjWzzz4mY,Did not skip an ad! Thanks for the vid! :)
SKsjWzzz4mY,can u make a video of creating a plan(a sample one) to demo and how can we efficiently communicate those things
SKsjWzzz4mY,Thanks for the video!☺️
SKsjWzzz4mY,"Happy that you are back healthy!
Great video! 🙂"
SKsjWzzz4mY,Good video. Tq
SKsjWzzz4mY,Great video! Thanks :)

Z2AachB309o,"27:39 holy shit, this story sounds SO SIMILAR to something I did recently at my job. Went from doing mail merges of 50-250 people into a single master word doc, convert to a master PDF, but then needing to manually extract individual client data by hand, 2-3 pages at a time.... Got tired of it and wrote a VBA Macro that automated it after setting up and starting the mail merge process. Ran on the computer for like, 2mins, ended with 50-250 individual PDFs. And I LOVE it. I'm so hungry for more efficiency/automation work"

Z2AachB309o,"Thank you so much for sharing Alex!! I come from a Social Work background, my Data Analytics career change is in full swing at the moment, and there have been plenty of moments where I wasn't sure if this was the right choice/if I can make it/is this even possible.
I'm sure there will be plenty more of those moments (especially on days where SQL passionately disagrees with me xD ), but going forward I'll come back to your video on said days, take a deep breath, and carry on. Thanks again 🌶🌶🌶"

Z2AachB309o,"Jalapeños :)), btw thank you so much for sharing your valuable experience"
Z2AachB309o,"Hello Alex,

I hope you are doing well. Let me start by saying first ""jalapeños."" I know this is one of your older videos, but it is so impactful. Thank you for taking the time to share your story with us. 

I have always loved analyzing data. I retired from the Marine Corps a few years back and have been trying to find my place in a new career. I naturally look toward operations management; it is my comfort zone. I held a position as a Business Analyst as my first role right out of the service and loved the work, but I felt something was missing. I always used data to help me make decisions, but I didn't have the necessary KSAs to take me to the next level, so I went back into operations management. 

Based on your recommendations in some other videos, I started taking classes on Coursera. While I have not made it to where I want to be yet, I know I will make it there.

I will touch bases with you in the future with an update once I make it; but, I will say this up front:

Thank you for being a part of my success. 

-Andre"
_gP-DH0iZLw,Is it okay to start being a data analyst first then change to cybersecurity analyst?
_gP-DH0iZLw,Do you need a degree to become a data analyst?
_gP-DH0iZLw,🙏🏾💯
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Hey Alex, I'm a B. Tech in CSE graduate fresher, I'm planning to do my masters in Data Analytics but I don't like coding, even though being a CS engineering Coding feels difficult for me, so rather than taking Data Science I thought of taking Data Analytics else UI/UX. What would you recommend me? Please help me out! Alex"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"If you’re coming from a BD/Sales career, and has zero knowledge in Data Analytics, will it be a good idea to shift?"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Hi, how do you suggest someone who has no IT background get into the Data Analytics career path? I've been burnt out of my current job and I've always been trying to get into the IT industry. Thank you!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"I appreciate this video, I'm currently choosing my career path either a data analyst or a software developer. Now it made me clear that I really want to pursue Data analyst career. Thank you 😊✨"
_gP-DH0iZLw,Information is like a jet engine.
_gP-DH0iZLw,Interested....
_gP-DH0iZLw,Sounds like a dreadfully boring career if I'm going to be honest with you. But to each their own.
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Pretty much, great content.
Please is there a way where I could do data analyst straight forward without Database Tech or database management."
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Hello Alex! One quick question. I ve already learned how to use Power BI and Im currently learning SQL. After these two tools, what would you recommend me to learn? Python for example?

Thanks in advance"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Awesome detailed video, thank you Alex!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"I love your content, please can you add subtitles to your videos .. you speak really fast and it wasn't easy getting all you said.."
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Been struggling with making a decision between cloud and data analyst for a career change..
Your videos helped alot alex thanks a lot
My only fear is the lack of data jobs where I live"
_gP-DH0iZLw,I love it! Binge watching you’re videos and it’s very insightful
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Hi, I am really glad I have discovered this channel, because I am thinking about transitioning my career into data analytics. I am also thinking about the future vision - where I would like to work, should I aim for positions at companies or start as a freelancer. There is not much info about freelancing in data analytics, maybe you could share some info from your experience? Is it worth trying? Thanks!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Hey alex, In future can robots or AI take on data analysis. Is it a good career option?"
_gP-DH0iZLw,On point 👉
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Hi, thank you for this video. Do you see a master degree in Data Analytics would lead into a strategic career level in an organization? Something like Chief Digital Officer? I am working in a data tech company that provides analytics to the Oil & Gas sector and currently doing my masters in DA. I don't like being an analyst (aka doing frustrating manual work) since most of my career is client-facing roles (sales, customer success, etc). I prefer to be in an executive role where I can lead a company towards becoming more  Data Driven that can lead to its success. Would be nice to know your point of view on that. Thanks again!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,ur videos are very informational and helpful keep it up GG..
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Sir,  can you please make a video on which companies hire entry level data analyst !
It would be very helpful for me"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Love your videos here. Check out LearnAnalytics as well. We feature industry professionals from well known companies such as Uber, Spotify and more. We want to share insights on the data profession."
_gP-DH0iZLw,Hey Alex...can I have your linked in?
_gP-DH0iZLw,Thanks for the video Alex! Love learning and watching!!
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Alex , you have been an inspiration to me, I look forward to seeing your videos Everytime."
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Can't thank you enough for helping shine a light on specific questions that so many of us have regarding the industry! As an undergrad graduating in 2022, I have taken an interest in a more data scientist track compared to a data analyst track. Since data scientist roles more often than not require master's degrees, should someone look to become a data analyst initially and eventually become a data scientist later in their career, or would you suggest a different path for someone looking to become a data scientist?"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Number 6: One can live their life to their fullest and enjoy those sports and hobbies that they thought were too risky and would put them out of commission if injured when it comes to work. I figure as long as one can type, and crutch or wheel their way into meetings, then all is good!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Did you ever consider becoming a software developer? If so, what made you choose data analyst over dev? I ask because I have been studying to become a developer but data analysis, big data, etc. really interests me."
_gP-DH0iZLw,Just finished a 4-hour YouTube course on SQL. Plan on taking some online courses on that then learning Python.
_gP-DH0iZLw,What laptop do you recommend for a data analyst?
_gP-DH0iZLw,Could you do a video on what to look for while job searching for a Data Analyst position. Like looking over some D.A. job postings and breaking down what the company is looking for. Thanks
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Thank you, I am considering to be Data analyst or business analyst. I have the bachelors in business administration and a certificate in computer programming at csu los angeles in 2019. Now I'm focusing on learning sql, python, statistics, excel, tableau, etc. So I can have the necessary skills I really wanted to have to be in the my intended field."
_gP-DH0iZLw,"I'm an Information system student, can I be an data analyst ??"
_gP-DH0iZLw,Amazing. Been waiting for your Python Interview Questions Video for a while now. Any idea when will it be out ?
_gP-DH0iZLw,Good inspirational message for aspiring analyst . And please make a video on the skill path should be followed by data analyst .
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Will you be hosting another live Q and A soon? Enjoyed the last one and I have a few questions. Thank you for the videos, they're awesome!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Ok, at least you mentioned transitioning to data engineer!!  (Thats what i'm thinking of doing)"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"Forgot data analysis, how do I get my beard like that?"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"What is a technology / process (besides SQL haha) that you were very excited about seeing do the work you wanted it to do after lots of hard work? Mine was this python script that forecasts inventory need. It took a lot of work to get it into a readable format by the algorithm, then to process it into a digestible configuration. Python pivot tables and the package seaborn are awesome!"
_gP-DH0iZLw,"You are my role model sir .. I get a lot of inspiration from you , thank you ..😊"
_gP-DH0iZLw,You switched career. How did you feel confident in your abilities to switch?

-Inc1be4zSg,"Hi Alex, I found this video because I am looking for a quality video on R's Shiny apps, but I'm still hunting! (I guess there must be a keyword on 'shiny' in here somewhere)."
-Inc1be4zSg,Could you make a video on how to get a data analyst job in a domain you don't have any experience in. This could be because the domain in not the degree I have and/or literal job experience. I feel that a lot the recruiters usually tend to skip or give lesser importance to your job application because of it.
-Inc1be4zSg,On topic at 3:00
-Inc1be4zSg,It is Nice topic. I like it.
-Inc1be4zSg,Thanks for all of this info!
-Inc1be4zSg,All good!
-Inc1be4zSg,the video starts at 4:15
-Inc1be4zSg,How do I get into contact with a recruiter? Is there a process?
-Inc1be4zSg,Rule #1: Take care of your family!!
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hi Alex, found your channel two weeks ago (5 reasons not to be a data analyst was the first video of yours that I saw). I am just beginning the process of learning SQL and the other skills you highlight so I can change careers (25 years in retail grocery as a cashier) and live in a suburb of ATL.

I'd like to ask about the following situation: what are your thoughts about contract or contract-to-hire or gig jobs appearing on an application for someone looking for that first Jr Data Analyst position who has no other experience other than cashierintmg? Is seeing a bunch of temporary contract work a plus or a minus on an application,  when applying for that full time job. (I have a particular domestic situation that keeps me tied to retail)"
-Inc1be4zSg,How to select data for doing our own project from scratch?
-Inc1be4zSg,hey alex could you share some of the technical interview questions that involve case studies??
-Inc1be4zSg,Thanks!!!!
-Inc1be4zSg,"Alex, maybe just cut-off the interrupt to make the show more succinct?"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Very nice video, thank you"
-Inc1be4zSg,"You don't have to apologize for caring about your kids. 
You're doing a great job!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hi Alex, it was really great to learn about the hiring process that goes in the background!! I wanted a piece of advice and it would be an honor to get an advice from you. I am just starting out in this field, i.e I am learning skills right now. What should I put in resume if I don't have any experience at all. If I have only skills and no experience, what should i put there to land my first ever data analytics internship??"
-Inc1be4zSg,Great format. Keep this up.
-Inc1be4zSg,"It's great to hear about the other side of the application screen, especially when you're neither hearing anything back nor applying for positions you feel unqualified for. Thanks for this insight- it's truly appreciated."
-Inc1be4zSg,It’s so kind of you to take your time to offer us valuable help.  Thank You 🙏🏻
-Inc1be4zSg,"I was offered an on-site nterview this Thursday after 5 days I applied. Is it a good sign? It's a data analytics/report writer position of a hospital in a REALLY small town. Am I expected to do any coding interview? What questions should I expect with the job requirements below? I have no experience in data analyst work experience. I know SQL (took DB management class in undergrad) and some web development (graduated from bachelor's last year).

 ""Minimum Work Experience: A minimum of 2-3 years’ experience with Microsoft SQL preferred. Microsoft Access and other database systems a plus. Proficient with Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office Products preferred. Moderate experience with a Microsoft-based programming language (Python,Javascript etc) a plus.""

Thank you!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hi Alex! Thank you very much for the  information. I have a suggestion. It would be awesome if you can wrap up what you talked about at the end of the video. It could help the viewers to leave the video with a better, sharper understanding."
-Inc1be4zSg,"Thank you for sharing this. Got me quite discouraged though. After your life story video, I got the impression that the field is not that competitive since you got in without a degree or experience. But in reality, you are an exception."
-Inc1be4zSg,"Alex, I like your channel but one honest complaint. Sometimes you are explaining one single simple point 4 times in a slow pace. I get bored and thinking you just want to extend the video time. Again thanks for all the useful information and hope this helps you improving the video pace."
-Inc1be4zSg,Which industry have much scope or openings of data analyst.....?
-Inc1be4zSg,we need episode 2 for sure
-Inc1be4zSg,"Great video, Alex.
I am Statistician and I recently moved to America and  now I am trying to find a job here as Data Analyst. I've done some interviews and I am waiting for the to reach out back to me (as they say they would). It's so frustrating that I can't do nothing but only wait.
I love you channel!! Success!! :)"
-Inc1be4zSg,Alex i need your  guidance  as I wanted  to switch  my career  as data analyst  do guide how should I start looking for change
-Inc1be4zSg,bro you are amazing
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hey Alex!

Good to know you are doing good. It's really an inspiring story. A lot of hard work that you have put in all through in self learning and also a bit of lady luck that has a little role in your career transformation. Wish you all the best for years ahead. I'm really feeling hopeful about myself after knowing your journey. 
Thanks a lot!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"I'm so excited to see more of these.  Watched it at work and was very motivating. Excited to see the new setup.

Mic sounds good
Flow of the episode was good
Topic was great and a nice starting place

Expecting a fun intro in the future."
-Inc1be4zSg,"Great content, thanks! Would you consider doing it live and editing afterwards? That way, we could get some back and forth with you ^^"
-Inc1be4zSg,Do you know of any jobs or sites that have 100% remote positions for data analysts?
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hi Alex! I just transfered career focus a year ago and just graduated with my masters in Business Analytics! My issue is that I don't have any career experience in the analyst world, so I personally feel that my skills are less strong than someone who began as a freshman. Do you have any suggestions for someone like me? Are there specific job titles or keywords that could give me a leg up? Thank you so much!!!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"hi alex, i want to ask you something, in your job that you have now,you write code? and if yes in what language? thank you"
-Inc1be4zSg,This episode was so refreshing! Your videos are so needed and no one is talking about this. Thanks Alex!
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hi Alex, I have a question on how to do analysis on repeat orders/customers. Is there any specific way/software to do it with? Great video btw!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Thank you so much Alex!!!!!,"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Congrats Alex, get more professional! Great content always!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"i am a data analytics undergrad, is it necessary to do a masters?"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Thanks for this Alex, you really are helping me to profile myself better as a data analyst. One question, how do you see remote data analysts for an entry position? I mostly see senior vacants"
-Inc1be4zSg,I just discovered you today! I'm currently a Physics major in Texas and I am exploring my options and data analytics has been very interesting. Thanks for your insightful videos!
-Inc1be4zSg,is there an email i can reach you at to ask some questions? im starting a Masters health informatics and have a couple questions because you are in Healthcare as well
-Inc1be4zSg,Brilliant!! Thanks for sharing your priceless information and experience
-Inc1be4zSg,"Informative. Lighting, audio, and camera are crisp. Clothing and background don't matter so long as the material is good, which it is! I think hearing about the other sides' perspective is informative and gears up the listener who is seeking advice. At moments, it seemed like the conversation tailed off track but in this long format it feels more organic than just reading off a script. From my studies, professors who walk in with bullet points and ensure they covered the bullet points in the 45 minute setting did a way better job teaching than those who came in with a full on script. Thanks for mixing it up!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"I’m having a interview for a business analyst tomorrow, what your advice for me? I’m in the healthcare field too. Thanks!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Good video! Thanks Alex.
As a college student who wants to be a DA after graduation, just don't know what level of those skills such as SQL, python or R the hiring managers are looking for. Could you please provide some details about this, or maybe a interview with an entry level DA would be helpful?"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Enjoyed every second of this episode!
You put alot of effort on your job and your channel while taking care of your family at the same time, RESPECT!"
-Inc1be4zSg,"Hello Alex.
Thank you for all the contents you dish out to us.
Please can I reach you via your email?
Thank you"
-Inc1be4zSg,Great going Alex👍
-Inc1be4zSg,"great timing, I have an interview today!"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Good point on the SQL question
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Option one lie and get the job but have a chance of being fired but gaining work experience and a salary out of it to avoid a job gap., your next job will never know because they can't asked why were you fired.  Or the second option, hand them an honest under qualifying resume where they won't hire you, but it shows the world you have gumption and 40 years  later you're a senator.    Truth is if an employer believes they need 3+ years experience or a college degree to do this medial level job, then they deserve to be lied to."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Goody 2 shoes always want u to tell the truth while they still lying to you haha
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"They would never say : Here we treat employees like crap with bs pay. They hide it. So if they hide some things, why should i feel bad about hiding some things ?"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Nah lie on your resume - was able to get more interviews, jobs and connections this way. They do not care 9 out of 10. We live in a corrupt, dishonest and two faced  broken inflation economy and society. You do whatever you can to get out of unemployment and slave wages.

With the sheer amount of poverty, unemployment, cost of living and living in a world where oppprtunity is so bs you should 100% lie to these greedy high expectation applications! No one in this day and age has the credentials these companies want. I been hired and interviewed about jobs all the time and tell me these requirements are just ""technicality"". Everything these days are in serious demand and because of these compqny boomer mentalities they can't train the actual position on the job or help wprk for and pay for the training, degree or certification everyone struggles! So ya definitely apply regardless because they have no idea.of the struggle. I gotten jobs all the time and lied on them to filler their interests. You have too! World dors not give a fuq anymore and if they do the worse they can do is not accept your application and continue to struggle trying to find someone to fill their void. Thanks for the unemployments, ridiculous amount of requirements to have a better job to get out of poverty ane your own company's ignorance!

People should be sick of these low wage jobs we only ever get hired for and never get out of poverty! Its BS"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I agree with this video. These lies can catch youout for technical roles.
But lying about skills fir a basic iob at the bottom fkr minumum wage. Wich youll learn the job in training. Not  bad. I mean youngott aearn to live. But lying anything for a role above the bottom. Would be a no go. As its quiet easy you can get found out. As any job a above the basic bottom role. Will always requier some skill and experience to count on."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,These corporation lie to us all the time; play dirty.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Reasons not to lie:
1. You like being unemployed
2. You want other candidates to get the job
3. You actually want to be homeless
4. You enjoy job rejections
5. You like being lied to and manipulated by companies and feel you shouldnt do the same...ya know like fair is fair isnt applicable"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I haven't worked in 14 years and my resume is completely empty. Every detail besides my name is a lie.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Don't lie in the resume, lie in the interview"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"If you haven't found this gem yet, this lady shows you how to ""lie"" on your resume the right way:

https://youtu.be/07fKv1_gyEI"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I’m at a point where I’ve applied to like hundreds of jobs and im not even getting a call back. Soooo….
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"it feels impossible to get a good position and not lie, i for one have told the truth but it seems that i am not viable to be hired for anything beyond customer service."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Never lie about being able to play an instrument. My friend put on his CV that he could play the piano. Then some time later his boss asked if he could play for the board of directors. He was googling how to break his fingers, but at the end he confessed to the lie."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Saying not to lie on a resume, or not too grossly exaggerate, is absurd, when the rules of the game as established by employers themselves, require that you lie. In case anyone hasn't noticed, entry level jobs no longer exist. By that I mean every job listed as entry-level now requires 2 + years of experience. In effect, what this means is what I previously said, entry level jobs no longer exist. Thus, unless you fabricate something very cleverly, or exaggerated to the ultimate degree, how does one without the requisite experience gain employment? Employers have no right to expect a hundred percent veracity from prospective employees when the rules of the game as established by the employers themselves demand that you not be truthful in order to gain employment. Bottom line is, if you tell people to lie to you, don't be surprised or angered when they do."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"You define embellishing like I define lying. Saying you have three years of experience when you have one seems like it would be classified as a lie. 

And I would definitely lie. They’re looking for anything to get you out of the pool so they can refined the talent search. That is what happens when you have multiple people applying for the same position, so I can get where they are coming from, but it means as an employee you do what you have to do to get noticed. 

I have been stuck in a career change due to it being a career change and me lacking experience even though I have an advanced degree in the topic. It’s been very difficult for me to find jobs to get experience in order to have the experience to get the job. And I can’t do an unpaid internship with three other people depending on me. 

So heck yeah I would lie because the people making the hiring decisions don’t know what they want or need half the time anyway. Just look over the job description and see if you think you can do the job.

As another commenter mentioned I would not lie about key skills for the job."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I got fired for saying the truth about my references.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,What's really stupid is when they ask for personal references.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Terrible advice. I always lie on my resume
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"0:24 No, lying is lying. It's funny how people say you shouldn't lie while they themselves ""embellish"" or just ""exaggerate"" the truth. Its pure cognitive dissonance."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Joshua Fluke's excellent video would be a good rebuttal to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ufwxkurKKg
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Corporate Simp!
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I'm don't support lying. But lets be real. Are companies fully transparent with job candidates? Then whey do we have to be Fully Transparent with them?
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"With hiring managers being so stupid and short sighted , everyone might as well lie"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,downside of lying on your resume - you will not be hired for job which you will not be hired for if you wouldn't lie on your resume... doesn't look too down for me... actually seems the exact same depth...
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"about ""ruining reputation"" - wasn't there a precedent when ""ruining reputation"" costed a lot to ruin-er? isn't it exact reason why companies don't provide details other than employment dates and position on ex-employees?"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"""I had somebody who came..."" - so, at least this somebody had a chance - wouldn't he lie he would not even ""come"" to have been had by you..."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"That’s why nowadays it’s a lot harder to lie because they can contact all your references in a second and dig deeper into your history, such as a background check to see if you were a criminal or not. In those days before the advancement of computers there were probably a lot more people that lied on their resumes because employers would not have the time to find out. It used to be a time consuming process. Now it only takes less than ten minutes to find out about the candidates and they can get about their day."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I’ve been a dancer for 5 years it’s straight sales! The only way I can think of putting that on a resume for “previous experience” is lying and saying i was in sales but use a different job name… I know I would kill it in sales.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Fake it till you make it...
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I have an almost 2 year unemployment gap (because of personal issues that I won’t get into) on my resume. But I presented it as it is. During interviews, I’ve got asked a lot of questions about it. And I’ve got turned away from probably 20 companies because of it. But eventually I got hired by a well known automation company as a data analyst, because I have work experience in automation, and because I've learned the basic data analyst technical skills(SQL, Oracle database). And now I can work without the anxiety of lying. Thanks Alex!"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I lied in my resume and tomorrow is my final interview!!! Soo scary 😧
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I'm 10 seconds in... BETA!
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"""If you lie on your resume they might let you go""
If you do your job they might also let you go..."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"You should lie on your CV (UK) = at the end of the day, when someone is finally given the job - depending what it is but a lot of times what they want you to say at an interview can be completely different to what they want you to do on the job. For example, on the interview the employer would say things like ""we are here for you when you have tough family matters"" ""safety is everything"" ""respect is everything"" ""equality is everything"" etc etc you get the point. You get the job, arrive at the place, explain to everyone you're new and within minutes a hand ful of those employees have gone against what you was told on the interview/application. Apprentices for example - some of them go through a tough process to get the apprentice, and when they are on the job, they are treat like piece of shit on a shoe, being victimised by ""initiation pranks"" and just being the mental and physical punch bag for all the other workers. So why can't we lie on CVs when most advertised jobs are also based off lies? What's worse than your colleagues treating you like a retarded puppy at your new job? your actual bosses and supervisors getting in on the joke too!.

So for those reasons - I would say ""go ahead"" to anyone wanting to put on the odd lie on their CV.. unless it's for a career sort of job like becoming a doctor, cop etc..because then you are completely screwed. But applying for a job at some factory or whatever..go ahead and lie to get you that place.. chances are.. most did in the first place."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I say lie on your resume.

Unfortunately hiring managers love to play these gatekeeper roles, and they do a fantastic job at it. In fact, they do such a good job at it that the United States, who used to be the epicenter of manufactured goods, is now reduced to a “consumer’s market” with its World Reserve status on the rocks. See, lying is something they had to do themselves to get where they are today...but then those same people expect their prospects to be honest??

As far as reputation goes, if they try to ruin your reputation, if anything it sheds a light on their character that they don’t want shining on them, and it may even introduce lawsuits. Personally, in the industry I represent (IT), I haven’t heard of an employee getting ousted for lying on a resume, and they have no business doing so. The best case scenario of just getting fired is actually the common method of handling a liar (at least in the industry I’m in).

Now when it comes to something where human lives are involved such as driving a plane or surgeries, I agree you shouldn’t lie during those times. Any other case, I say go for it. Once again, they can lie to you in your face, and yet they expect honesty from you?? They can lie to you about compensation, actual responsibilities, your benefits, your hours, and potential for career advancement within the organization. They can even lie to you about your longevity within that organization. I’ve seen personal horror stories where people get let go after sinking years into a particular company simply because their services were “no longer needed”. No justification. No closure. I’ve even seen people complete a project, and get laid off immediately after without disclosing that the position was temporary.

TL;DR Lie. They get to lie to you (and they often will), so it’s only fair if you do the same."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"What happens if you lie about finishing your Degree? going to the school, but never finished?"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Question what happens if u lied about your age but your old enough & have your ID and work permit during a job interview
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Should you lie!? Absolutely! Employers aren't honest and you'd be a fool to admit your shortcoming to your potential employers when bills need to be paid. NEVER DISPLAY EMPLOYMENT GAPS!!!! Play the game or someone else will eat your lunch.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"One you should never be honest with their resume (resume not interview), because you'll usually get rejected if you have a job gap."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I made it clear to my manager that I was only a beginner in SQL and Python, and I was given a couple of weeks' time after joining to get myself familiarized with both. I'm glad I didn't lie, or else I would have been expected to deliver right from day 1, and I would've definitely failed.

Thanks for the video, helpful as always!"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Can you say what the basic SQL question that you asked the person was?
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Nice video, but I want to talk about my real story here. I lie on my work experience and get my first job. A lot of people said do not lie on your resume, but most are bullshit (Not your video). Anyway do not feel bad for lying on your resume because you're not the only one. Now I'm 22 make around 100k in 1 year and bunch of benefits ez. I lie on my resume because I have been the worst situation at that time."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I'm glad I came across your video when I decided to switch career.. Thanks for always sharing great videos and knowledge.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"I wish I had known about your mentorship sooner or I would have signed up for sure!
I let my GitHub repositories speak for themselves as far as my skill level goes. Now, explaining to a future employer about my nearly three year employment gap since graduation working only part-time jobs unrelated to the field, I would explain that finding any job to leverage the skills I acquired during my degree program has been challenging and have had to take part-time jobs here and there to pay the bills and put food on the table until I acquired the necessary skills to gain employment in this field."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I legit will be emailing you for mentorship (hoping you say yes) this is so amazing we just don't have the resources to know these things man! SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS!!
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I fee there are times when it's ok to lie by omission - to leave off information that may skew you into roles that don't interest you.   My degree in mathematics is on there.  My degree in economics is not.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"In Australia, sometimes you have to lie to hide your qualification or experience, because some manager will feel threatened about hiring someone who can out do them in a few years. We think people with master degrees are losers."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Hey Alex, great video and content. And explanations are crisp and clear. I am a mechanical engineer with four years of experience. I am looking forward to switch my career to data analytics and data science. I would like to integrate machine learning to my domain and increase the skillset. Can you please share your thoughts on this ? Is there a way to reach you.? 
Thank you"
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thanks I had a thought to lie but now it's crystal clear why I shouldn't !
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Agreed. Especially in Tech to lie on your resume is one of the worst ideas.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,"Great tips for sure! More people need to see this, especially fresh out of college folks."
CsMh7Ykmnw4,I am in an interesting position because I am ultimately looking to transition into Data Analytics and have been doing a combination of self teaching and getting my MBA (to hopefully move into finance or tech). I have gotten an increase in analytics responsibilities in my current job and have pushed myself to utilize the new skills and tools I learned (such as Python and SQL) so I can list them on my resume without feeling guilty about lying.
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thank Alex for this important topic 😊
CsMh7Ykmnw4,Thank you for the tips and you are totally right.
ho2vzKPAD50,"Alex thanks for doing great  favor, as every free resources do give only beginners level free videos, where could we find a complete resources related to data analyst"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hi Alex,  as a beginner with no experience in SQL, what would you start with: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc? or does it make no difference at all in the beginning? Thanks"
ho2vzKPAD50,When you will upload advanced SQL .. and demo type of project using SQL
ho2vzKPAD50,Interesting Live 👌
ho2vzKPAD50,is MIS a good degree to become a data analyst or data scientist? i know i can be a data analyst without a degree but i want to know is MIS useful
ho2vzKPAD50,"I learn python,MySQL,Power bi, Tableau what is the next step or which career I can define myself"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hi Alex, I'm currently studying Comp. Sci. and I'm 2nd grade. I did an EDA on kaggle and I wonder what projects should I work on or do to find a job faster in data analysis?"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Can you show us a hole project for learn and practice  with you ,please"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hey Alex!
What are the differences between Data Analayst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist also what are the tools needed to be advanced in those fields? 
Thanks beforehand, I love the way you talk, You're very humble! Can't wait to see this channel grow bigger. May everything goes okay with us in spite of being in this pandemic:)"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hi Alex, I just want to ask if is it possible to make a lateral move from financial analysts to data analysts? As you said, entry level jobs are saturated and it will be great if I could make a lateral move instead. On my day to day job, I am focusing on analysing trends or conducting time series analysis rather than extracting or cleaning data."
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hello alex...
With sql and Google  sheets knowledge...what would be ..next step to upgrade my skills ....would that be cloud  domain .?...either way ..please suggest me"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hi Alex, Is it possible to make Q&A #1 & 2 available?  I wasn't able to tune in.  Thank you for your channel!"
ho2vzKPAD50,"Wishing I had not missed this!
I have been studying and practicing SQL for over a year now, and over 6 months of experience using Python demonstrated by doing projects which I have posted on GitHub. I have a masters in exercise science, though many consider the degree useless, the program I did was research intensive with doing a lot of data analysis using Excel and SPSS. My long term goal is to become a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and or data engineer. My short term goal is to land an entry level job whether it be as a data analyst, database administrator, or entry level database developer. My question is will getting an Oracle Database 12c Administrator Certified Associate Certification greatly improve my odds of finding work? I plan to take a certification course through Syracuse University this fall and have heard its very intense. My other option was SAS Base Level Programmer, but I have seen videos and read forums where SAS is being replaced with R and Python and that SAS will eventually fade out."
ho2vzKPAD50,Dang i missed it! ...I was going to ask as a rising freshman in college what types of opportunities or like internships should i try to go for once i do want to apply for them...any internships or experiences that would standout on a resume.
ho2vzKPAD50,"Bummer I missed this! If it's ok to ask, do you think someone who has a Bachelors of Science in Communication Studies would qualify them to start becoming a data analyst? (With the supplemental knowledge of SQL, etc)."
ho2vzKPAD50,"Hello Alex, how are you?"

I am not much good in coding. I am planning to take Msc data analytics or Msc cyber security. Please help me to choose the best for me.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex
I am currently working on the Google certificate. I realized i used a lot R on my case study. I haven't used any SQL or tableau. How popular is R? Is it less likely to find a job with R? Thanks."
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"What about libraries (numpy,matpolib,pandas) it that important 🤧🤧plss reply 🤐🏃‍♂️"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,So I have a question.  I have to do a career change.  I cannot drive a truck anymore because of a health condition I have.  I want to get a computer job but I do not have a degree and I am too old to go back and get one now.  So what do i need to do to get into computers at this point.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Will the Google certificate get you into the field??
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex, how are you? Do you think is worth it to go for a Master in Computer Science when you are starting in this Analytics world? As right now, I am good with Excel, Power Query, Power BI, DAX etc... but I am hoping to continue to grow in this area, and I was considering going back to school, not sure if I should wait to have more exposure to all of this before getting the master... I come from a different background, I am in Finance and I have a MBA as well. Thanks, this channel has been very helpful!"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"If i  only have basic knowledge of excel,where should i start learning for data analyst?Access and excel simultaneously?Should i learn Access  at all?Or sql also at the same time?Or should i start with power b instead of access?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,I would also like to add that just because you have attained a piece of paper which states that you know what you’re doing (I.e. degree) does NOT mean that you know what you’re doing.  At least in my observations…
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Confident but weak!?  Makes no sense…
5MZo2RoS8Yo,I'm so glad I found your channel! Thank you Alex
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hello Alex, thank you for the video. I have a bachelors degree in Economics and other in Accounting, and now I’m starting my carreer path as a Data Analyst. I’m doing the Google Data Analytics Certificate Course but In your video you suggest that Excel is a must, can you please suggest me a good course so I can have a better understanding of it ? And also, after I finish my Google Certificate, what do you suggest me to do? Learn some Python? Thanks a lot!"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Hi Alex I did accounting as a bsc. And I applied for a masters in data analytics. Is it a good recommendation for me to go on? Since I do not have a background knowledge in computer science
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Thank you so much. This video is very informative and you do a great job at simplifying everything
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Thank God I found this video on YouTube.

5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hello  , You mentioned about Masters in Statistics & Information System. So will Masters in Health Informatics or Biostatistics play the role?"

Do you know of any company offering a remote setup? I'm finishing up on my Python and reviewing SQL again, as my current position never utilized SQL so I'm a tad bit rusty.
Thanks bud!"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"This is really helpful, Sir."

5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Do I have to go to college to be a data analyst? I'm thinking about just learning the computer skills, and a few data analytics/data analyst courses through Coursera. Is that good or should I strive for more?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"I’m an applied computational mathematics major with computer sci minor from California uni bout to graduate soon 
Am I basically good to go for entry level data analyst role?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hey man, I’m sure you get these a lot... I did my bachelors in hospitality and business studies. And am finishing my masters in tourism. Currently living in Germany. After recent events I want to change my career path. Data analytics seems like the way to go. Full disclosure, I have no experience in the area.  And am preparing to start a certification program from google. My question is , is it ( data analytics) inter disciplinary .  Can a newbie succeed in landing entry level jobs in this field?...
Thank you man.
Love your content"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex, thank you for the work you do! Question, what's wrong with R?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Thank you for this. What if you have to remove every job?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,I'm taking the Coursera Google Data Analyst Certificate - any thoughts on it? Thanks
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Can we get a data analyst job without an IT degree?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Analyst 🤣🤣🤣🤭 now I definitely have to make this my career path!
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Hi buddy I am an aspiring data analyst from India currently doing my bachelor's in computer science and have started a few Udemy courses for data analyses but I am very much confused on what should I do after my college. It would be great if u could help me by guiding me in this exciting field.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Do you need Math?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex,
I was wondering why you said computer science degree is more useful than data science for analytics?
I am about graduate with the computer science degree and planning to do data science and most those class in the computer are relate to compiler design, computer architecture and cryptography and rest of then are common classes with data science."
5MZo2RoS8Yo,What about statistics?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Thanks Alex! Really great insights!
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hello Alex, I worked on 2 projects, cleaning and collecting data and updated on my resume, later the interviewer commented , these days it's very easy to download data and showcase as projects.
Also he didn't ask any questions from my projects. 
I was so disappointed. 
What are your remarks on this😐"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,So insightful. Thank you!
5MZo2RoS8Yo,It's been 2 years I have been looking for a job in this field and I am still with empty handed. Harsh reality! I am not saying don't go and learn these skills. But how real world behaves is much different than that of a 5 minute false hope video.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Being a data analyst are you using pandas library ? Is it necessary to learn pandas for a data analyst job? Please reply.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"web application, biology,physics, and chemistry are my subjects in school so it doesn't have maths so is it possible for me to become a data analyst if not what are my options? I love your videos man helps me doing research a lot easier❤️"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,This is an amazing video.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Very relevant video 👍
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex. I'm just getting started with SQL and i was wondering,  do you recommend MySQL?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Will this help in the career field of Accounting and Auditing like CA or ACCA? if yes, then which one should I learn first?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex! May you help me with something? I have some doubts :S

I'm near to finish a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics, and I liked very much Data Analysis (because one of my  subjects was Multivariate Analysis, and I love doing a project for that subject). I want to do a Master, but I don't know if there is a difference between Master in Data Analysis and a Master in Applied Statistics, because once I heard that some people were telling that a Data Analyst was the same as an Applied Statician. May you explain me if there is a difference between them? I would be really grateful :D"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hey Alex. I have completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering in India. Then I started working as a Python Developer for 2 years. Currently I migrate to London and I am pursuing Masters in Data Science. My master’s course length is 1 year. Many people told me that this 1 year Master’s Degree wont be standout in front of those who have 2 year Masters Degree course. So, my question is that does my 1 year Masters Degree won’t be in consideration compared to others who have 2 year Masters Degree ?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Very informative. Thank you for the video. Just the one that I was looking for!
5MZo2RoS8Yo,I'm so confused right now cus there is a new major (Data Analytics) I'm interested in. The thing is the study lasts 3 and half years. Well the half year will be spent as a mandatory intern but I was wondering what the heck I will learn for the whole three years (if I get into) when skills of data analysts can be taught during only 3 months😅 So I looked up the study plan and there are far more subjects/areas listed that are not mentioned here or elsewhere. Can I send you or anyone else who is more experienced in the field the study plan? 🥺🥺
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi , I have associate degree in civil engineering and worked as cad drafter , is this can help me to apply for a job as a data analyst ? Is there any special field that is required to do data analyst ( like computer science )"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Hi alex..i am a sophomore doing Ba in Mathematics and Economics..do u think my combination suits for a carrer in data analytics..or do i have to suffer??
5MZo2RoS8Yo,How useful would knowing R and SAS be?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex, your content is awesome.  I am looking for a junior position in data analyst and what is your recommendation about cloud platform? I am wondering learning aws or azure,  which certificate do I need and can help me for finding a job ? Thanks"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,I would love to learn more about this career path. I am definitely subscribing and connecting with you on LinkedIn.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Where can i study these that companies accept?  I found a course on coursera but i don't know if it's good enough to get me a job as an analyst
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hey!!!
I want to become a CA... And just want to add some data analyst skills which would help me in future... Can you clear which skills would help mei"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Hi Alex, Sudin here.
I am doing Economics, BSc Hons. What do you think about becoming a data analyst/scientist after completing this degree?"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,I just graduated with an Information Technology degree and have created some projects in python with some basic SQL integrated into them. Could this be enough? Could my degree be an issue?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Great video...even though I was annoyed by 2 commercials in a 9 minute video.  In any case I really liked the idea of developing projects.  The amount of work that you need to do (that is if you want to do it right) is staggering but, I believe, it would be worth it.  The main problem I have is that I'm a bit older then most of the people applying for these positions.  I have a Masters but none of my education involved Date Science (short of a couple of Statistics and Decision Science classes).  All of my analytics training has been done on my own time.  

I find very few jobs listed as ""Entry Level Data Analyst"".  Most if the jobs I see on Indeed start with 5 years experience.  I like the idea of creating a Linkedin page.  I have an account but I don't really use it.  Last thing......Learning Python....that is a very ambiguous statement.  You can learn the basics in two weeks.  The important thing is to get your basics down and then know where to go for the rest"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Man, this is great super clear and simple keep it up!"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Would you help me to get job brother am tired of applying
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Thanks a lot Alex the Analyst.Your videos are really useful for me or i can say guidelines for me .After a break of five years in job (worked as Java developer for 10 years), I have chosen to be data analyst and your videos are really helpful in that. Thanks once again."
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Your content is crisp and clear on point , every minute is not all a waste one.
Subscribed 👍"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Love your content !!!
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"I have been working for a year thinking that I was a Data Scientist. I always use SQL, Python and a lot of Excel as well as I design dashboards, collect and analyze my data. Now, I realize I'm a Data Analytst and well I'm so happy to know it. Thanks man and great video."
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Can u do a video please about how to write a cv for entry level analyst that is ATS friendly. Thanks for the great content.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Hi Alex! I'm so glad to find your videos on you-tube. I wanted to progress in HR in the field of HR/People Analytics. But after watching your videos I'm thinking why to limit myself to HR Analytics? What do you suggest. Should I go specifically for certifications in HR Analytics or in Data Analytics? My background is that I'm an engineer but havnt worked as one for a long time.
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Thanks
5MZo2RoS8Yo,Hi alex I am doing BSc business and Mathematics. would you you that i can still do data analyst with this?
5MZo2RoS8Yo,In future any software replace the job of data analyst
5MZo2RoS8Yo,It is so amazing im gonna cry
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Converted to a subscriber, awesome videos full of gems 👏👏👏👏"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,"Thanks to your efforts, as well as that of others, I just landed my very first official ""Data Analyst"" position. I am striving to become a Data Scientist and will go the distance, as you all will. NEVER give up. Alex, u da man"
5MZo2RoS8Yo,python/R are no longer wish list items. It is a must.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Don't become a data analyst if:

1) you don't want to hear ""man i hate mondays"" and ""happy friday!"" every week for the rest of your life"
M2ySRYpo9S0,I assume your wife clicked the dislike button
M2ySRYpo9S0,"70,000 dollars a year is quite little for an American, I'm Argentinian and with that amount I can even expand my own house, if that's a poor job I want it with all my heart lol. Nice video as always bro!"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Hey, I have like 10 years experience in sales / business, 2 years in marketing, knowledge of excel, google analytics, ppc marketing, very little python and I love working on data and analytics. Im very tech savvy and organised and thinking of a career change to an entry data analyst. Would that be possible? What should my process be if possible?"
M2ySRYpo9S0,Top 5 Reasons Not to Become a Data Analyst
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I don't agree with the part about salary expectation. If you live in a city where the demand is high for this position you can definitely make some money, for example DC. I know people who started off making between 80k-100k."
M2ySRYpo9S0,The debugging is a little ick but let's go
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Thank you for a great video, I appreciate the honesty, I have been thinking about it a lot, figuring out my thought patterns, and your video answered my questions and now I am more interested ✨"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Don’t know what else to do. Every job is frustrating and bosses are at most okay. If struggling to learn something new will get me to a some what happy place, I’ll strive for it."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I think it’s so funny people think under 70,000 dollars isn’t good money lol. If I made 69k a year I’d be legitimately over the moon"
M2ySRYpo9S0,But what if u hire a tutor to teach u
M2ySRYpo9S0,"totally agree with you Sir Alex, I still hit my head with keyboard whenever assigned to a new project haha, so much new things too learn, at least for domain knowledge"
M2ySRYpo9S0,What would I require if I wanted to get into the field of sports Data analysis
M2ySRYpo9S0,Thanks a lot Johnny Sins.
M2ySRYpo9S0,In your prior video you said you have a recreational therapy degree and here you say you studied medicine.  Are both true?  I'm confused.  Thanks
M2ySRYpo9S0,"1. Be a self learner + lots to learn on the job.
2. Easily frustrated.
3. Hate doing menial work - data transformation.
4. Dislike working with people.
5. Thinking you'll get really rich quick."
M2ySRYpo9S0,I’ve dropped out medical school. Wasted night memorizing physiology and anatomy just to pass the final exams. Now im a programmer
M2ySRYpo9S0,I think you seriously need to re evaluate what you deem manual work to be.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Alex, are you kidding me now that you a medical Doctor?❤😊"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I couldn’t agree more, great advice"
M2ySRYpo9S0,Did  your wife ever eventually see this video? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Become a data analyst if you like people telling you that you're wrong, people gaslighting you, or if burnout is your dream."
M2ySRYpo9S0,DA or DE can work remote or work like a freelance job?? please answer me
M2ySRYpo9S0,I'm not sure whether this job is going to be obsolete soon if we have more advanced AI or machine learning. What do you think?
M2ySRYpo9S0,Thanks for the tips.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"If you're Data Engineer sooner or later you will touch PowerBI. It's a good choice if you're not extremely skilled at Software Engineering or coding and you like data visualization. You will always be frustated because the tough part is when you need to validate numbers of your dashboard with source.
But after various nights with no sleep, you will become as much as skilled to minimize the delta for your numbers."
M2ySRYpo9S0,2023 Starting salary has gone up substantially👆
M2ySRYpo9S0,Lmao lowkey passive aggressively bitching about your wife was hilarious
M2ySRYpo9S0,👏
M2ySRYpo9S0,Yo same with me left medical school too could’ve handle it
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Silly video for young people. Bad news, you have to work hard. Period. Jeez."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Thank you very much for your insight, very helpful for me ..."
M2ySRYpo9S0,I come in all 5 categories 😂
M2ySRYpo9S0,"""you need to figure things by your own"" ... that's what a good highschool and a good university should train you for , i suppose."
M2ySRYpo9S0,Thank you so much for making this video!! I was really stuck on what to decide to go for! Are you available for one on one questions?
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Glad I watched this, i can check this career off my list."
M2ySRYpo9S0,Hi Alex!! Can you please make a video on Data analyst remote job from overseas (Outside US). Like you work for a US based company from another country.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I have been a data analyst for 2 years now. FYI this guy is completely correct, I don’t like being a data analyst, and the  random ad hoc requests that come on a strict deadline is such a pain. You might even get multiple such analysis and requests in one day with the same day delivery deadline. I really want to become a software engineer now. I am feeling fed up of this."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"When you do not need that much money you start making it. That is why I will never waste my life on money and losing my health I will need the money for at the end of my life. Self-consuming  , not for me."
M2ySRYpo9S0,Hello please what is the difference between business intelligence and data analysis?
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Mmm...once you said 'communication' and 'working with other people' it was like someone hit a nail in my heart. Thankfully becoming Data Analyst was just one career option for me, guess I'll continue looking for a career where I don't need to interact with other people."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I actually took your recommendation to take the Google analytics course to try to learn this and it is absolutely true that you start off confused and frustrated. I check like 3 of of the 5 reasons why I should not be a data analyst.lol However, I find the skills of data analyst useful in other parts of life so I will just learn it as a hobby. Thanks for the video."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Most of these id still go for it as it's my interest. As for money, as long as I make 50k with benefits, I'm happy."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"1. Not a self learner
2. You get frustrated easily
3. Hate manual work
4. Working with people
5. Thinking you'll get rich being a Data Analyst"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I got an opportunity from a university for data analyst. 
I also like data analyst
But I worry about job 
What you suggest me should I choice data analyst"
M2ySRYpo9S0,Rude weak advice.. Not up to you to instruct others why someone should not become a data analyst. Next talk about your personal experience as an analyst..
M2ySRYpo9S0,Can we become data analyst by just SQL and power bi?
M2ySRYpo9S0,Very insightful!
M2ySRYpo9S0,=)
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I loved the art of picking a dead machine and figuring out the problem and one day at a time giving it life.
If these are the 5 downs of being a DataAnalyst, I think DataAnalyst is my DNA..
I find it fascinating to finally clap my hands and say, ""Whuu, this almost killed me; Thank God it's finally sorted."" 
I am going in fully...😎😎😎"
M2ySRYpo9S0,my wife is the same lol
M2ySRYpo9S0,I actually love all 4 things you said. The fifth is very very situational. But not false.
M2ySRYpo9S0,I just took an assessment on sharpest mind and the universe led me here. I’m searching for my next chapter and this gave me pause to really think about. Thank you 😊
M2ySRYpo9S0,I'm definitely going to enjoy being a data analyst
M2ySRYpo9S0,Is it hard to become a data analyst
M2ySRYpo9S0,I wanted to start in this Career. I actually enjoy a lot automating stuff on excel. However I still don't know the next steps to go for.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"You are the best! 👌 I want to change career and become Data Analyst,currently working in maritime offshore industry😃"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I wanna be a data analyst too, but until now even after watching your videos I still don't understand what data analyst is how difficult it is, it seems interesting but I don't know if I can stand it or ever learn it."
M2ySRYpo9S0,Pl upload with subtitles
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Big thanks for your great video. I've been in networking for 20 years so far, and I've just started learning Sql to discover that complex queries aren't that welcoming as I thought. Got to admit I'm not into mathematical jobs, time really matters, and so is my question: Do you think I'd better quit since I can't solve difficult sql queries? Are complex queries part of a business analyst job? Thanks again."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I mean, that's actually with every field, and that's what for they pay you for"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"What we refuse to accept is the reality, that Data science, analysis and engineering were not meant to be standalone roles in most organisations. You are to use Data related jobs as complementary skillsets like Excel, Word, PowerPoint and other programs to your other main job description. 
You can be a medical professional and data analyst with medical data. As an Educator, data science, analysis etc complement student data processing and visualization. 
HR personnel needs the Data science/analysis skillset as a complement to the organisational toolkit, not stand alone. 
Else you will find yourself in and out of your primary job functions as a Data analyst."
M2ySRYpo9S0,Thanks a lot
M2ySRYpo9S0,thank you
M2ySRYpo9S0,I have degree in statistics I want to become data analyst
M2ySRYpo9S0,As a graphic designer I think this is for me lol. Spot on
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I've only been a DA for about 9 months now. The title of this video scared me because I love my new job!
...but yes, this is dead-on accurate!!!"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Thank again, I pass these kinds of obstacle."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Trash job. 3 years in and I hate everything about it. Dont take this career expecting a ''fun'' life. Yeah, you might earn a lot but you are also gonna be miserable as hell"
M2ySRYpo9S0,I have completed my graduation in Bsc Physics and wish to swtih my career to data analytics. What is the best method  and I do not have programming knowledge and any base
M2ySRYpo9S0,almost all jobs that are (worth it) require communication or working with other people. that's just how it is in this world. can anyone name some jobs where you don't have to work with other people that much?
M2ySRYpo9S0,Requiring students to sit in a classroom all day is the biggest fail in education. It teaches obedience not skills…not everyone learns this way.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"I am a marketing project manager and i wonder if I could be a data analyst, so i watch your video and it helped me a lot, thanks"
M2ySRYpo9S0,This guy has to criticise his wife in some or other way 2:01.
M2ySRYpo9S0,I'm not a people person. This video helped so much! Thank you
M2ySRYpo9S0,Most of these reasons sounds lot like don't become a developer or most positions in IT
M2ySRYpo9S0,Love This ♥ Thank you !
M2ySRYpo9S0,Didn't know xwasdmitch had another yt channel
M2ySRYpo9S0,Sounds like my current role.

M2ySRYpo9S0,she's just taking advantage. Don't tell her I said so 😁
M2ySRYpo9S0,Mathematics is included in Data analysis?
M2ySRYpo9S0,your reasons like the shiiiiiitttt
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Haha I can relate. I don’t get frustrated early on, I try different things and I know when to take breaks."
M2ySRYpo9S0,I used to be a software tester...not for me.  I have a solid database background in SQL Server.  Would I be a good fit for Data Analyst?
M2ySRYpo9S0,"What job would you recommend to someone who loathes people, especially leftist feminist cretins but who's also good at math and decent at programming?"
M2ySRYpo9S0,"#1. Not a self-learner - ✓ check!
#2. Get mad if fail at first attempt - check ✓
#3. Impatient to do tedious work - check ✓
#4. Not good at self-expression and communication - ✓ check
#5. Got lured into data analytics because I wanted a well-paid job - ✓ check!
Now I am all set for a fascinating data analyst career!





So what do I do with my life and the time and money I invested into studying DA? 🤦‍♂️"
M2ySRYpo9S0,Hahahahaha. Data analytics is still better than being a security guard. I am going into it  data analytics.
M2ySRYpo9S0,is it too late to become a data analyst when you are 50?
M2ySRYpo9S0,I am good to go with business analyst
M2ySRYpo9S0,That's its official I'm switching from financial analyst to data analyst

M2ySRYpo9S0,"Is this also true for a career in ""Data Science""?, please answer me someone."
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Thank you for this video. I'm learning basic python these days and I like it. I am a self learner and I do like learning at my own pace.
Your point about ""gray"", manual work... it's part of what I DONT like about my current job. Will have to think about it 🤔"
M2ySRYpo9S0,Hay quá
M2ySRYpo9S0,No p. But Data is my food.
M2ySRYpo9S0,"Hello, may I kindly ask you to give some tips and tricks where to practice SQL ? I am practicing in my own database set in mysql but I would like to do some exercises etc. Than you :)"
M2ySRYpo9S0,Anyone else a Information System major?
M2ySRYpo9S0,Watching this video makes me frustrated already. What about becoming a business analyst? Thanks
M2ySRYpo9S0,Thank you so much for this! I just started looking into DA and this is has convinced me it's not a good fit :-)
ncXgqGePvwI,If you've taken a bootcamp please let me know below! I'd love to hear your experience after taking one!
ncXgqGePvwI,"Hi Alex,

Hoping all is well.

Thank you for your video! You gave some great advice and highlighted some key points. I'm here today to give a series of updates over the next few months regarding a data analyst bootcamp that I will be starting in 2 weeks. I currently hold a bachelor's in Exercise Science from UConn, and am pursuing a master's in Health Informatics from Purdue Global. I hope to land a job after completing this bootcamp while in school, then eventually landing something higher paying upon completion of my master's degree.

This is a change in my original career pursuit of becoming a physical therapist, which I found the student debt I almost got myself in to to be outrageous. I believe for me, the return of investment in this field is much much higher, considering my loans currently are 1/10 of what I would've been paying back in PT."
ncXgqGePvwI,My wife and I are thinking about taking the boot camp but we're worried with the new AI technology taking over
ncXgqGePvwI,Hey Alex! Thank you for all the information and time you put into making this video!Any thoughts on Colombia University Data Analysis bootcamp? Thank you
ncXgqGePvwI,"Thank you for taking the time to give advice! The offer I was given by one bootcamp for UI/UX was $15,000, with a 3 month, full time track and job guarantee. I will research my way through Udemy, Khan, LinkedIn, and others."
ncXgqGePvwI,"2 years later, do you still feel this way? There are a lot more options available now. I’ve seen offerings from over 20 companies; Thinkful, General Assemb.ly, Codecademy, etc. plus ones from companies like EdX that partner with universities. I’d love an update with your thoughts. As someone who’s trying to break into this profession in 2023 with no coding background, but a BSBA double major in economics and finance, the number of Bootcamp and online certificate options is a bit overwhelming. Thanks in advance if you update, and thanks anyway if not! Love the channel."
ncXgqGePvwI,"I'm contemplating doing a bootcamp, but I have no other 'real' tech experience.  I'm really wondering if a DA bootcamp + my liberal arts bachelor's degree will cut it."
ncXgqGePvwI,I don’t have a bachelors degree. I never finished school. I have some university coursework. I have a customer service background . I currently have a county job. I want to make a career change but I’m so confused on how. You said if you don’t have a bachelors degree and just a boot camp certificate you’re likely not to get the job. Should I go back and get my degree? It was in Sociology. Not really field related either. So idk what to do
ncXgqGePvwI,"Have you ever heard of Merit America? I would love a video on that as I'm applying and I've only seen positives associated with it. You pay $0 up front and don't pay anything until you get a job making $40k or more a year. Plus, they work with your schedule so you don't have to quit your job. You put in about 20-25 hours per week for 16 weeks. The price is $5,400 no interest, and you pay $95 a month after you get a job. I want to know your opinions on this as I've watched your videos for a while and would love feedback!"
ncXgqGePvwI,"I recently withdrew from a software engineering degree due to financial reasons but I can afford to take on a data analysis bootcamp while I'm out of school, do you think that will be enough for me to land a job? I have coding experience dating back to high school but not much job experience. I spent most of my years in college/high school doing freelance IT technical support on fiverr doing computer optimizations, desktop/laptop/phone repairs, and creating software programs for friends when I have the time."
ncXgqGePvwI,"So I got a masters in computer and information systems. My bachelors is in psychology. I did a career change and went into IT. My problem has been that the program undid my masters in was new so not as structured as it probably is now. Because of that I did not get any real experience and could not land any real entry level job because I am ""over qualified"". And since of that reason I have no real job experience because no one was really giving me a chance. Now I'm looking to get back into the workforce after being a stay at home dad but I think in order for me to do that, these bootcamps might be the quickest way. Not concerned about cost. Friend I know who have done these bootcamps have been successful and found a job quickly."
ncXgqGePvwI,Alex what do you think about Georgia techs data analysis bootcamp?
ncXgqGePvwI,Do you suggest to taking courses from Coursera first or any online courses or do bootcamps first? Right now I want a career change in my life and I've been interested in data analyst entry jobs.
ncXgqGePvwI,Is it required to take data science before taking data analytics courses?
ncXgqGePvwI,"With no degree, once I have some experience will that be enough? Or will I always struggle to find a job without a degree? And does a boot camp look good on a resume or does it just highlight my lack of higher education?"
ncXgqGePvwI,"Alex - super quick question: if money was NOT an issue AT ALL, would you recommend any of these bootcamps? if yes, which one(s)?
PS I feel like my answer would've been no, given the plethora of astronomically cheaper/free courses out there + the dedication to truly learning all of the skills and technologies in depth can only be done by myself at my own pace and which schools and bootcamps aren't really conducive for"
ncXgqGePvwI,What about bootcamps that requires you to pay only after getting placed
ncXgqGePvwI,"Hi Alex I have recently subscribed to your channel as I plan to become a Data analyst. I would appreciate your input on the below.
I currently hold a Masters's Degree in Supply chain management but have not worked in this space. I have worked in the Project management and Operations management space with shipping companies. Recently I moved to Canada and am looking for courses through which I can enhance my knowledge in Data Analytics. I finally narrowed down my search to the University of Toronto Data Analytics boot camp and Mc Gill University's Professional Development Certificate in Data Analytics for Business or  Professional DevelopmentCertificate In Data Science and Machine Learning. I am 40 and need a University name also to back my credentials. Hoping to get some clarity from you"
ncXgqGePvwI,Are there card games or board games that are about Data Analytics? It would make learning fun.
ncXgqGePvwI,"I have a masters degree in public policy from Germany and I have just been selected for a bootcamp in data analyst. The price is 12500 Euros that you can only pay once you get a job offer, 250 Euros per month. Does the risk worth it?"
ncXgqGePvwI,Daddy 🥵
ncXgqGePvwI,I have a bachelors in stats. I also learned more excel skills through linkedin learning. How can I get started through an internship?
ncXgqGePvwI,"Alex, I got my bachelors degree in IT back in 2011, worked for a year in IT then life took in another route more with administrative work. I got my MBA in 2018 but I am lost now and would like to major in Data Analytics. I live DC area. How should I start?"
ncXgqGePvwI,Thank you so much Alex for all your videos. They are helping me with organizing my thoughts 🙂
ncXgqGePvwI,Aye man I’m thinking about applying for a Washington university data analytics boot camp for under a little under 13k for 24 weeks. I have no experience and but they go over most things in the field. Mentioned about helping with resumes and landing my first job. Also said that they would aid me with the degree if I choose to go further
ncXgqGePvwI,Does the bachelors degree have to be a computer science degree?
ncXgqGePvwI,"What are your thoughts on bootcamps for people with degrees changing careers? I have a BA with a minor in stats. I work in finance and I want to move into analytics or data science. I plan on getting a MS but I want some on my resume now so I can start applying for jobs. I already have some coding experience through my minor such as SQL, R, and SAS."
ncXgqGePvwI,"Nice video, I am really lost about my career path after leaving my nursing major , but I am going to be using ur resources n other resources that r online to teach my self. Hopefully in 6 month I will be able to do projects n build my pro folio."
ncXgqGePvwI,Would data entry clerk be a good job position to start the career through data analyst? (after having the job just upgrade skills with programming) ?
ncXgqGePvwI,Would you mind sharing your email? I want to ask some detailed questions. Thanks in advance
ncXgqGePvwI,"I have taken one, I highly recommend just going to Web dev bootcamp first and learning the data analyst stuff in your free time...One for the simple reason you can get a data analyst job just knowing sql and how to do charts....I took the data scientist route and when I interview with employers they are basically looking for software engineers then being able to apply data techniques maybe for visualization...Just my opinion"
ncXgqGePvwI,"Alex, what would you suggest as an alternative? If I’m self taught or boot camp certified, that still leaves me with not meeting the minimum qualifications of a bachelors degree. And a bachelors degree is overall much more expensive and time consuming than a boot camp."
ncXgqGePvwI,Hi Alex.. You're doing great. I really like your videos :)
ncXgqGePvwI,"I'm currently undertaking a free offline 6 months Data Science bootcamp organized by the Korean government. If I attend the class over 80% each month, the government pays me $300 per month. The class is Mon-Fri (9am-6pm) and provides students laptops. I'm learning SQL, Python, R, ML, DL, NLP, Hadoop/Spark, Elasticsearch, AWS so far. All professors hold a Ph.d in Industrial Engineering from Korea University (one of the top universities in Korea). This program is very good."
ncXgqGePvwI,"You mentioned that if you only have a degree and a data analyst boot camp on your resume then you won’t meet the minimum requirement.  Besides the obvious experience, what would you recommend to make me qualified?    Thanks"
ncXgqGePvwI,I just want to confirm that the links you have recommended are what you’d most definitely recommend and not just because of sponsorship. Thank you for putting such helpful content out for us
ncXgqGePvwI,"I have friends taking bootcamps for 15k and they ask for help quite often, my courses are from Udemy and some other cheap places, it is not about which course or school you taking it from it is about how passion you are to learn it and then how curious you are about whats next, love the frustration. Sometimes i dream in code, and i am not kidding"
ncXgqGePvwI,Thank you for the light & direction 🙏.
ncXgqGePvwI,What about a masters degree in data analytics from wgu? What are your thought?
ncXgqGePvwI,"I am currently working on becoming an analyst and started a boot camp not too long ago. I’ve been looking for someone in the field to become my mentor, but haven’t had any luck. Would you be willing to guide me?"
ncXgqGePvwI,"How much do you use python is your daily activities? Compare it to your usage of SQL, proportion wise. (Hope my English is clear enough)."
ncXgqGePvwI,For real thank you man for  directing us for the right way
ncXgqGePvwI,"Hi Alex are you going to add any advanced sql courses, you are a very good teacher"
ncXgqGePvwI,What materials/sites did you use to learn SQL?
ncXgqGePvwI,"I have come to believe that no matter what courses you have taken, what bootcamps you went to or what books you used to study, at the end of the day, it's about whether you know your stuff or not. Of course it's not purely binary, because some people know more about SQL, Python, or just have better insights in general than others, but what counts is passing the code interview (and the other interviews). Let me know if you have other angles on this."
ncXgqGePvwI,I am currently enrolled on the data analytics bootcamp from georges Washington University. I can tell that you don't need it if you have the dedication and the commitment to learn which is what I have been struggling ever since i started my data journey. But the fact that you can put that on your resume would help i guess.
ywZXpfdqg1o,Isn't this just data Engineering ?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Hii alex i am 3rd year of B E student i am starting data analytics now where i can start i don't please help me please send the links to me
ywZXpfdqg1o,skills needed 3:30
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Im a developer with 6 years of experience I work as senior developer but Im being paid 40k per year
What you recommend me to get more salary? i'm from brazil"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I'm a computer science student going into 4rth year this September, what are some courses that will help me become a data analyst?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Very clear and elaborate
ywZXpfdqg1o,"i don't have a degree, but i have a background in financial services. I'm interested in this career switch after speaking with a friend working as a programmer, he recommened this as math, numbers and communication are my main skills, Do you think that not having a degree will hold me back in getting a job? i know it will help, but are they essential?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Is it an interesting job? Sounds pretty boring hope I’m wrong
ywZXpfdqg1o,Thanks for clear cut and to the point briefing on this subject. Very informative .
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Woow this is the best breakdown ever.
Thank you"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Thank you, Alex! Great, clean info and straight to the point!"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Great overview! As someone considering a career change, this really demystifies the role and highlights the key skills to focus on. Thanks for sharing your expertise!"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Thanks for excellent definition. ❤❤
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I dont understand why speak so fast, whats the benefits, just a little bit normal accessible at all ....LIKE THE DATA"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Ok but is this an enjoyable career and pays well?!
ywZXpfdqg1o,the video is interest and informative
ywZXpfdqg1o,I'm thrilled😋🎀
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I found your channel trying to figure out what I want to do. My job has a title or 2 but not sure how to look for something similar. Its clear that technology type careers are the best and have decent salaries. Thing is...I'm not that tech savvy. I am currently a federal contractor working as a part of a group of teams providing technical support services for a federal agency. My role specifically works with processing submitted requests providing the agency's employees with an RSA SecurID token they can use to access their accounts as a back up or in addition to the CAC/PIV cards they use. I work with a console that holds the profiles of the people who are issued a token and the token is created in this database. I use this database to troubleshoot any issues they are having with the applications as well. I manage an email that send and received various correspondences regarding the issuing and troubleshooting of the application the employees download for use. I have learned everything I currently do on the job. This job is primarily called ""Field Technician"" but I specifically call it ""RSA Security Analyst."" So with all of that said, I am kind of lost how to find something similar or to stay in this area of work. DO you have any suggestions. Incidentally, I do not have and am not currently required to have certifications such as CompTIA, Security+, ITIL, Etc."
ywZXpfdqg1o,Why data analist are employees?
ywZXpfdqg1o,I wish to get more insight on this course
ywZXpfdqg1o,you talked a lot and didnt give a single example ...
ywZXpfdqg1o,it did not
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Clear understanding on data analyst role 
https://youtu.be/l-WcQcvx9Qk?si=WNw9rZLy9VUydLKX"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Could he have talked any faster - IDIOT
ywZXpfdqg1o,Why are you talking fast for 🙄🤷🏽‍♂️
ywZXpfdqg1o,going through a lot of pain for only 110k a year ? !! LOL. come on man. 110k is worth the same as 65K pre-Covid
ywZXpfdqg1o,Waste of Time
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I hold a statistics degree, currently doing a post graduate diploma in data analytics. I have been teaching myself Sql which was so much fun i must  now moving to Python then i'll learn some basics in power BI and start applying for jobs next year. I'm so excited to start a career in data analytics. Your video was so helpful. Thank you❤"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I recently graduated with a masters degree in zoology and did a lot of data analysis in my degree, and so am now looking to get into data analysis. I’m looking at getting into it from the angle of environmental / ecological data analysis. Do you think it’d be possible to get into data science this way?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,So without a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree then taking the Google course is a complete waste time?
ywZXpfdqg1o,As a data analyst I can tell this guy has never worked as a data analyst before 😅
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I see. So, all CRUD programmers by default are data analyst"
ywZXpfdqg1o,What Does a Data Analyst Actually Do?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Well done! Condensed a lot of information into a very practical video. Thanks!
ywZXpfdqg1o,Really free on Coursera?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Do you need to be an informatic to do this job?
ywZXpfdqg1o,hey can i learn and work for this thing iam 15 years old
ywZXpfdqg1o,Help!! What education is required to become a Data Analyst? I have a Mechanical Engineer since 2018 but never used my degree because I stayed home to raise my kids now I need to work and have started to look into this career but not sure where to star. Any input is well appreciated
ywZXpfdqg1o,"junior can be degree, entry level is closer to ""entry level"""
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I want to be a data analyst, but English is my second language. Sometimes I feel it's very hard to continue learning.
I'm taking a course on Coursera called ""Google Data Analysis.""
Wish me luck.
thanks"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Hey Alex!
I am Data Analyst and currently working, as I m doing freelancing also one of my client approach me as he is giviing data analytics services to different companies so he is asking how much he should charge data analysis service to companies or their client? if they hire us one time what will be the pricing? if they asking services from us on monthly, quarterly or annually how much we should charge them?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Thank you, Alex! You summed everything up perfectly."
ywZXpfdqg1o,Helpful 🎉😊
ywZXpfdqg1o,Thanks for useful imformation. How about xml for data analyst? Is it required for data analyst job?
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Thank you so much for the Data Analysis job description. I'm currently taking Data Analysis course through Coursera. There are 8 courses total, and I'm currently on course 4."
ywZXpfdqg1o,looks super boring
ywZXpfdqg1o,Sibei well summarised I'm gonna be a data analyst one day!!
ywZXpfdqg1o,Wow by far the easiest and smoothest explanation I’ve listened to. Thanks Alex!
ywZXpfdqg1o,thanks for sharing
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I thought I was watching at 1.5 velocity but no, was normal 🤣 btw great video"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I have a degree in food science, can I go for data analyst."
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I just watched this video today, I gotta say wow, you're amazing..
I'm currently in my 2nd year doing my Bachelors degree and I'm hoping to be a data analysit some day..
I will go through your videos and understand/know what's best expected of me..
Thank you for this videos good Sir.."
ywZXpfdqg1o,Is it a good paying job?
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Hi Alex, I’m a new subscriber 
New to data analyst in general, I’m a Graduate in finance but I would like to pursue a career in data analyst.
I’m looking forward to watching more of your videos."
ywZXpfdqg1o,I  have a degree in technology and technology management. Will that be an acceptable field for the Bachelor's requirement?
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I have a degree in physics, i really like data and math but hate coding. Is this a good career if i dont understand how to code?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Restaurant to another world secret episode wow 
(Saw this video on a playlist of anime)"
ywZXpfdqg1o,ok
ywZXpfdqg1o,Just a bunch of words that mean nothing to an outsider. You mught as well be speaking Chinese. It would be much more helpful to show people what a data analyst does.
ywZXpfdqg1o,I have no college hrs can i still do this with just high school diploma
ywZXpfdqg1o,Shit this sounds boring. I am interested in the visualization aspect though; is there much money to be made in that or do most data analysts just hire regular graphic and ui designers . I am interested in learning since i've capped out at around $60-$70 hourly as a graphic and web designer and was wondering if doing data visualization could pay more. but I am not interested in the actual analyses part whatsoever...
ywZXpfdqg1o,This salary is complete Bs. Not worth it.
ywZXpfdqg1o,Is python enough or need to learn R too?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Thank you
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Vey good! Simple, clear and easy to understand. Plus, I like tall the covered fields you spoke about. Thanks, Alex!"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Wow, this very informative and to the the point! Thank you 🙏"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"you talk as if i know what you are talking about, hope that helps you to make better beginner videos if you really wanna help ppl understate the subject"
ywZXpfdqg1o,I searched through your videos to see if you have addressed the connection AI may or may not have in your field. Do you have a video on the concern that AI will take away jobs in your field or do you think it will?
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for your explanation, I have just been accepted in the ALX fully funded program and I'm trying to understand what is this exactly, I honestly don't have any degree or any work experience related to this, I really hope I can manage the program well.
Though, I feel like I understand a little bit more what is data analysis and what to expect that I would study in the program. Thank you."
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Hi Alex. Thanks so much for taking the time to do this. It's super helpful to us aspiring Data Analysts. And like your random jokes, comments, intro of your dog, etc. These all keep things light and interesting 👊🏽"
ywZXpfdqg1o,How long can I study data analytics to become entry level?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Thank you for being transparent.
ywZXpfdqg1o,This is my next hurdle. A data analyst
ywZXpfdqg1o,Explained too fast...should explain in slower pace...
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Just found your video because I just recently applied to EdX to get the certificate for Data Analytics Basics. I have always loved problem solving, brainstorming and analyzing everything. So at the age of 44 with no previous experience or college of any kind, I feel like this is the perfect career for me! Thank you for your information!"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Data analyst here in Philippines only got paid for $600-$1000 a month.
ywZXpfdqg1o,"How much Maths does a data analyst needs to learn and/or use? Please, its the only thin that holds me back from considering it as an option."
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Data analyst and data scientist same
Thing ?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,Your videos are a big inspiration! just started out my own youtube (from my experience as a data analyst) All the best!
ywZXpfdqg1o,this sounds mind numbingly boring
ywZXpfdqg1o,Queen can you help me to become a data analyst please
ywZXpfdqg1o,Analyze data?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Is it possible for me to learn and work as data analyst if  I'm not that good with maths🥲 I'm really interested though
ywZXpfdqg1o,I’m running out of ideas of what to do with my comp sci degree..everything seems so complicated and way over my head..I can not do web or mobile app development no matter how hard I try ughhh
ywZXpfdqg1o,Got multiple data analysts offers with no degree. First job 74k
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Thank you for your insight, I am interested in taking a deeper dive into data analyzing. Currently working in quality assurance and general insurance policy information processing"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Good day, sir. Could you pls help my finacē how to start? He is a language teacher but he also wants to try DA."
ywZXpfdqg1o,why would someone need a masters to do something so simple?
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Hey, I started the google Coursera for DA following your reccomendations. I am really enjoying. I am learning a lot about SQL and its functions and syntaxes. Which software should I purchase to create my projects? I have MS."
ywZXpfdqg1o,You should speak more slow
ywZXpfdqg1o,Wow Im clueless of what ur talking about 😂 deep words. I need baby words to understand this. Hahahhahahhaahaha
ywZXpfdqg1o,Where can I learn data analysis?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Thank you very much for this video and info. 😊
ywZXpfdqg1o,Where do Data analysts work?
ywZXpfdqg1o,"I'm currently working as a Data Analyst III, and I'm searching for a full time position."
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Do not take the coursera course recommended. I am taking it and the course uses google sheets while many business will use excel. Also, the instruction from the lesson aren’t clear. When you get stuck, you cannot get help although there is a coursera community."
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Went to college and got a bachelors in economics and we only used a data software called state where you import data spreadsheets and run regressions seeing how much a variable affects another, how similar are those other programs to Stata?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,"Went to college and got a bachelors in economics and we only used a data software called state where you import data spreadsheets and run regressions seeing how much a variable affects another, how similar are those other programs to Stata?"
ywZXpfdqg1o,programming is necessary?
ywZXpfdqg1o,Very thorough & helpful thanks! ❤
IqQCBytyATo,Ask me questions below to be featured in the next Q&A video!
IqQCBytyATo,"one more question, when you say having a Bachelors degree is helpful, does it have to be data science/analysis, or any Bachelor? I have a B.A. History, M.S. Library Studies, and working on M.A. Philosophy. oh, and when do you think you'll have open spots on your coaching tier?"
IqQCBytyATo,"Hey Alex, if I'm taking the Google Professional Data Analyst Certification,  which introduces R, should I take a Coursera Python course at the same time, or focus mainly on R, as you indicate Python can be difficult?"
IqQCBytyATo,"What if you have 9 years of. Career gap and then u wanted to become data analyst,is it possible.as my kids r old enough so thought to start my job,please reply and any suggestions would appreciate.Thank you"
IqQCBytyATo,Can you please tell me that what are the skills required to become a data base administrator (DBA ) ?
IqQCBytyATo,"Hi Alex, I would like to know if you think data analyst is a good position/career to start to make a transition to data engineering in a future."
IqQCBytyATo,"hi alex, can u make a video on how to create a resume."
IqQCBytyATo,"Hi, thank you so much for this opportunity... As I said in another comment, that I’m 2005 graduate of B.Sc Computer Science, But I have experiences in documents controlling and archiving... Since graduation I have seek to improve myself.. but I lack the clear target! till I found your channel, since few weeks ago I started study a Sololearn course of Data Science, since I have a humble knowledge of SQL and Python and liked to improve it... but I saw your video of Data Science vs Data Analysis and I have found my way! Data Analyst! So, any word of advice in the light of the aforementioned... thank you"
IqQCBytyATo,What is your opinion on types of degree to get a good entry level job for being a data analyst. Like does it matter what type of degree you get for example sociology going into data analyst....knowing that you came form a somewhat medical field i might know but just curious
IqQCBytyATo,"Alex, I’m an outbound logistics specialist whose only experience with queries was Power Query which has set me up for success in my current role. Watching your videos and hearing what you can do with SQL has inspired me to start learning to further develop my reporting and analysis. Thank you for the content you’re creating and for the beginner videos you’ve posted, they’re wonderful resources. For my question: are there other free resources you would recommend besides what you provided in your free resources video?"
IqQCBytyATo,What makes a really great portfolio?  What key points is the employer looking for in it?
IqQCBytyATo,"I recently found your channel and subscribed after a few videos (that rarely happens but I can tell you have great content). I am currently a Statistics major with Data Science minor and I enjoy basic python but don't like the programming that I do at work as a software engineer intern, what role would you suggest for me? I am leaning towards BI analyst as I am into finance and business domain in general. Are there other roles that could possibly fit my interest?"
IqQCBytyATo,"Hey Alex, I have recently graduated with a Mathematics degree and want to pursue a career in data analytics/consulting.
Do you think it is worth doing a masters in data analytics/science or could I learn the additional skills though virtual internships and boot camps?"
IqQCBytyATo,Alex do you have any recommendations (books or course) for data visualization. I know it plays a huge role in being a data analyst. Thank you!
IqQCBytyATo,Hello Alex. Good content. Which one should learn Tableau or Power  BI?
IqQCBytyATo,"Hi Alex, great content. Do you happen to have examples of python related questions that may come up during an interview?"
IqQCBytyATo,"Man, all your videos are so good!"
IqQCBytyATo,Alex is data analyst is used in stock exchange and supply chain management and logistics
IqQCBytyATo,"Hey Alex! Not sure if you answered this in the previous video, but how important are cover letters in your opinion, and if they are, what should be included? Really enjoying the content, thanks so much for helping."
IqQCBytyATo,NEW HOUSE!
IqQCBytyATo,"Hey Alex, could you make a video on how you applied for jobs, before the interview, tips would be helpful for people looking for entry-level positions."
IqQCBytyATo,"have you heard about people use eviews,spss or matlab to do analytics and is learning them important or just waste of time,and thanks for your help."
IqQCBytyATo,Did you have to go through any coding interviews? Either for SQL or Python?
IqQCBytyATo,What an awesome video. Thanks for doing these and for the extremely helpful information!
IqQCBytyATo,"Hello sir  I love your video you inspire me. I am now in 12th after ward what should I do to be a Data Analyst.Hope you reply sir,"
IqQCBytyATo,"Do you think that having intermediate Python (libraries you mentioned) and almost no SQL would seem good to an employer? Or SQL is really, absolutely a must?"
IqQCBytyATo,Excellent video. By this. My knowledge is improve in data analyst. Which countries has more jobs for data analyst?.

MpIi4HtCiVk,I'm keep getting ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'twitterscraper' all the time. What am I doing wrong?
MpIi4HtCiVk,"Hi Alex, I wanted to check if it is legal to scrap data from twitter this way? The video was very information but I read somewhere that we need to use Twitter API's for twitter data"
MpIi4HtCiVk,"I just found you today.  This was Awesome!  I loved how you presented this information.  As someone completely new to this workflow, do you have a course that you teach?  I am very interested in learning this entire workflow"
MpIi4HtCiVk,"For those having issues with twitterscraper not returning anything - it's broken. The library ""twitterscraper"" is currently broken (check the github). 

What bothers me is that Alex, the creator of this video, is clearly avoiding the question in the comments, and is saying things like ""I haven't had time to research this"". A 30 second search will give you the answer to why twitterscraper isn't working.

There is a working alternative, and I'll let you find it yourself (again, check the GitHub)."
MpIi4HtCiVk,"Hi alex. This tutorial is very helpful for beginners and intermidiates as well.
I follow your code, but it don't show me any output! The dataframe is empty. 
All the code is run successfully but don't be able to fetch data.
I use windows 7 and IDE is jupyter notebook.
So plz tell me how I can fix that?"
MpIi4HtCiVk,"Hi despite using the codes you've provided, I honestly don't receive any tweets in return. My return was only ""_"" and I've no idea whats wrong with it. 

And I've also run into error ""df = df.loc[df['screen_name'] == user]"" (KeyError: 'screen_name') How do i resolve it?"
MpIi4HtCiVk,This is great stuff. Question: is it possible to build a data scraper for social media sites like Reddit and Twitter to pick up chatter on what stocks people are talking about the most just before the market opens? I’m trying to figure out if there is a way to predict which stocks will move the most based on how many people are talking about that stock during pre market hours. Thanks.
MpIi4HtCiVk,"Hi Alex,  you have done a very clean and sweet presentation. And from your video, i know how people scape data from twitter now.  However, sometimes, when people post a tweet, they add pictures right below to explain themselves more clearly. By using the scraping bot, we can get the text but we missed the pictures.  

So, it is possible to output the data into a word file by keeping both the text and picture in order ?

Thanks"
MpIi4HtCiVk,Is scraping tweets legal? I have been tinkering around with web scraping and I found out that its a very debatable topic and has its own pros and cons. I just want to learn all the allowed things before I can actually do things on my own. Can I please get some information on this?

Programming has been the most difficult part of this change for me

MpIi4HtCiVk,"Great video, thank you very much!

I used another scraping method as I am working on a similar project right now. I will publish this on my channel in the upcoming weeks. 
My NLP results are different from yours as I am considering more tweets (roughly 1,5k).
I will be using some of your techniques e.g. the NLP part and the seaborn visualization. I did some amendments but
I will definitely give you the credits in my video.

Nevertheless if that's a problem for you, please let me know.

Kind Regards

MpIi4HtCiVk,It doesn't work. Still 0 tweets
MpIi4HtCiVk,"Hi Alex, newbie here :) Your work is great. It helps me a lot. But i have some issue. I hope you can help :) When i try to scrape tweets from tweetscraper; each day, it starts crawling from 12pm to 00am. Due to limitation of API i think, it blocks me somewhere in mid of day(e.g. 2pm) I need all day not only 24pm-2pm interval. Do you have any suggestion for me?
Somebody try to fix this by changing date to time. But i cant manage to run it. (using anaconda/spyder)

do you need to be advanced?"
MpIi4HtCiVk,Thank you Alex. You are a life saver. Everyday you give me a reason not to quit on my quest to be a data analyst. Will surely digest this thoroughly.
MpIi4HtCiVk,Super awesome job!!
MpIi4HtCiVk,"Just started Python for everybody, so I don't think I'm quite ready to scrape yet. But this was great to watch!!"

G4syHs3M82E,"in my exp, the roles are swapped. My life as a data analyst had much more expectations, less resources / software, and required much more business exp. My life as a business analyst required more technical skills, and was more closely tied to leadership. I spent 7 years more aligned as a DA, and 3 years as a BA and it was much much harder as a DA."
G4syHs3M82E,Business analysts receive more salary than data analysts
G4syHs3M82E,"Great breakdown, but I’d like to add that Business Analysts don’t always come from business or MBA backgrounds. Many enter the field through certifications and practical experience, especially in data-focused roles. Certifications like CBAP, PMI-PBA, or even structured learning paths such as the Business Analyst Track from 365 Data Science can equip professionals with the right skills. In today’s job market, hands-on skills in SQL, Excel, BI tools, and real-world problem-solving often outweigh traditional degrees."
G4syHs3M82E,Hello
G4syHs3M82E,"This is a very good video, very detailed but not overwhelming. Thanks Alex, helps a lot. Cheers."
G4syHs3M82E,BBA with Business Analyst + Data Analyst from online? Is this good ?
G4syHs3M82E,"Thank you Alex 
You made me think clearly now"
G4syHs3M82E,THANKYOU VERY MUCH FOR EXPLAIN CLEAR AND I GOT CLARITY TO DO WHICH COURSE
G4syHs3M82E,"i have a hard time understanding that in terms of salary. When you write Entry level: 45K-60K, does that means monthly or for the entire year?"
G4syHs3M82E,Thanks for sharing Alex - John from @BusAInsights
G4syHs3M82E,Due to inflation multiply those salaries by like 1.4
G4syHs3M82E,"Hello, is this salary per month or per year?"
G4syHs3M82E,"Crystal clear, appreciate it."
G4syHs3M82E,You got two subscriptions from my two google account plus more from my friends who i know and recommended
G4syHs3M82E,Data Analyst vs Business Analyst | Which Is Right For You?
G4syHs3M82E,"For you who are googling for this and get hinged on the salary, it's good to remember that these are mostly US salary levels. For example, in Switzerland, a Business Analyst & Data Analyst make the same salary from junior through to mid, but in senior the Business Analyst is actually earning more. So, check out stuff like that depending on where you live, because this has a lot to do with demand and supply. Some countries have more business analysts and some more data analysts, though at the end of the day, these are in demand in most countries and you'll probably make a really good earning."
G4syHs3M82E,Thank you Alex for your nice information. Many many good wishes to you.
G4syHs3M82E,"It almost feels like a data analyst can do whatever the business analyst is doing, no?"
G4syHs3M82E,"You're awesome, thanks for your valued sharing"
G4syHs3M82E,Is a chartered accountant suitable for a business analytics course?
G4syHs3M82E,"I'm conflicted on whether I should get a masters degree on data science or business analytics, since I graduated last year in data science for my undergrad but worked with business analytics in some sports teams right after graduation."
G4syHs3M82E,"Salary range for BA seems low. 100K plus isn’t uncommon in certain domains, such as pharma."
G4syHs3M82E,Is there possible to become a business analyst after doing a degree in management and information technology??
G4syHs3M82E,"Well, you don't always have to have a degree to get into analytics. Talking from my experience :)"
G4syHs3M82E,"then, what is the predictive businuse anyalyist ?! is it a data scientist ?"
G4syHs3M82E,This is so totally different to waht my university taught as business analyst work. They focused entirely on the soft skill side
G4syHs3M82E,I want to be a business analyst but I can only find a data analyst internship. Would hiring managers care that it’s data only? Or if you applied for BA roles would you qualify as a data analyst?
G4syHs3M82E,It's really helpful. Thanks.
G4syHs3M82E,"Alex,thanks for your video.i have a question, is data analyst the same with business analytics,and is business analyst the same with business analysis?"
G4syHs3M82E,"I can earn a graduate certificate in Business Analytics which includes SAS actually. I intend to become a data analyst, but considering I'm a Journalism bachelor's of science, I may have more foundation in business analytics. Also I want to dabble in data journalism for trade publications. Ultimately I want to hover around the cutting edge of data science as I earn and learn."
G4syHs3M82E,I only have highschool and can code in Python and Mysql with Excel PowerBi and Tableau at an advanced skills. Do I need an undergraduate?
G4syHs3M82E,is it worth getting a GC in Business analytics ? already have BBA - accounting.
G4syHs3M82E,"You are competing with your slides. Instead, try using slides for complementing your speech."
G4syHs3M82E,im really bothered by that vertical line
G4syHs3M82E,You are doing a great job. I currently possess a Master's degree in Finance and looking to switch to a data science role. But I found it very difficult to secure admission to a master's program in data science due to my insufficient math and statistics background. Could you suggest to me how to sort this out?
G4syHs3M82E,"You just explained what I was looking for in the most simplest way.
Thank you Alex🙂👍"
G4syHs3M82E,is Business analyst same as business intelligence ?
G4syHs3M82E,I have my bachelor’s degree in mathematics and I am currently working on my master’s degree in business analytics... thank you for this video. I feel like I could go either way with my degrees
G4syHs3M82E,$ or £?
G4syHs3M82E,This is why the Rutgers BAIT (Business Analytics and Information Technology) major is so great. It combines the skills you need to become both a Business Analyst and a Data Analyst into one major.
G4syHs3M82E,very nice & detailed .. its great
G4syHs3M82E,"Do not take the data analysis course recommended by him from google. Bc it’s google, the course mainly use google sheets while most businesses use excel. Also, instructions isn’t clear in the lesson. And when you get stuck, there is a community but it’s no help. No one is there to answer your question"
G4syHs3M82E,Thank You Sir.
G4syHs3M82E,That was a very clear explanation
G4syHs3M82E,If I don't have a college degree in anything but instead I enroll in a bootcamp to become a data analyst do I have a chance in breaking through?
G4syHs3M82E,Thank you I like your videos
G4syHs3M82E,Which major should I choose International Business or ICT. I want to become a data analyst and also a business analyst. I have studied Economics before .

G4syHs3M82E,You have a very wrong information. Business analysts make more then data analyst. I feel sorry that you are trying to making your self happy by saying that haha
G4syHs3M82E,Hi Alex... I recently came across your videos and subscribed to your channel.... Your videos are really great and helpful. I’ve done my Masters in Finance and MBA in International Business and have overall experience in Banking & Financial Operations. I want to upgrade my skills into Business Analytics or Data Analytics and have been exploring information and videos for a few days but still confused and not able to decide which one is the right option for me. I would really appreciate it if you can suggest the best options for me as per your expertise. Thank you...!!!
G4syHs3M82E,"Muchas gracias, excelente video!!!"
G4syHs3M82E,I have a BA in sociology. Can I break into data analyst role. I need guidance
G4syHs3M82E,"Finding it very hard to break into either field despite having a BS in Business Administration, an dual major MBA in Business Analytics and Operations Management, and having advanced experience with Power BI, Excel, SQL. and Python. And it seems many firms blend the duties and responsibilities of BAs, DAs, and PMs together as if they fall under one role or title."
G4syHs3M82E,nice comparison!
G4syHs3M82E,"I got a degree in MIS Business Analysis and am having a hard time breaking into a career. So I'm thinking about going back to a 2 year college or cheap state school to learn Java, Python, and really get good at SQL. But I'm also trying to self-learn as much as possible. Thank you for your videos."
G4syHs3M82E,very nicely summarized
G4syHs3M82E,I have one question if the same person can occupy both positions (both DA and BA)?
G4syHs3M82E,Thank you so much for this guidance 😊
G4syHs3M82E,"I was considering doing payroll but considering switching to data analyst. I work in management as a fleet manager. I enjoy it working with lots of people and helping with various functions. But I really want to specialize. I do payroll and I do lots of complex spreadsheets. Now in my field most fleet mangers are mouth breathers who like to do everything in crayon....but I really enjoy data, running reports, finding answers to complex problems, solving those issues....it seems like data analyst would be swell. Payroll is ok, but it's just sooooo boring.....only plus side to it is less human interaction and possibly remote. But I don't care if it's remote or not.....I just wanna get the f**k out of Portland and head back home (east coast)."
G4syHs3M82E,"So simple , so good !"
G4syHs3M82E,Great video
G4syHs3M82E,Thanx alot i was stressed becuse of the confusion you made it clear 💙🙏
G4syHs3M82E,"Wow Alex, so glad I found your videos!  Was just searching for how to best utilize Linkedin for gaining a job and then turns out I find your video about Linkedin and you're a Data Analyst - what I'm taking courses in now, haha!  And in Coursea, so I'll be watching your other videos on their courses next to see what you have to say!  This video is super helpful, as I want to work remotely.  I've been living out of the US and really am hoping to land a job that will allow me to work outside the US.  I am an extrovert and have many soft skills related to the Business Analyst position that I would LOVE, but I figured a position as a Data Analyst would be more likely to allow me to be completely remote (i.e. dealing with tech team and mainly staff vs. dealing with clients).  Would you agree?  Do you think it would be possible to get a completely remote position as a Data Analyst?  If you have any insight, I'd really love to hear and maybe even talk with you sometime if that's a possibility!"
G4syHs3M82E,"Dear Veterans 
A young aspirant here seeking knowledge to answer my questions
1. I like numbers, I wanna work where in I need to derive at conclusions by numbers I am not sure if it's called data analyst or data scientist
2. I am studying project management and I am interested in it as well but don't have technical knowledge as my specialization was business administration, could you please help me if PM is the right field for me?
3. Is machine learning required to be the data analyst as I don't want to be someone building tools to analyse but be an analyst"
G4syHs3M82E,The example for salary is  for year?
G4syHs3M82E,"Is it true for these roles to overlap sometimes? For example, the job advertised to me on LinkedIn when I applied was data analyst, meanwhile, after I got the job offer the official title was a business analyst. When I looked it up,  a business analyst is sometimes considered a subset of data  analyst. What do you think?"
G4syHs3M82E,"I am a business and data analyst, and i suppose that business analyst should take higher salary, understanding management and work flow has experience with dealing with customers and company's departments and his team. I think his recommendations and actions have the business sense if we comapre them to data analyst presented,, Technical skills are easier to learn and apply more than life, work and people experiences"
G4syHs3M82E,Sir business analysis and business analyst are same or different? If they both are different so which course is better
G4syHs3M82E,Nice explanation!
G4syHs3M82E,Great teaching and I love it...
G4syHs3M82E,salary mentioned is in dollars?
G4syHs3M82E,"I just got offered a job at Pfizer entry level business analyst $80k no degree just telecom experience…. 

His qualifications are bogus"
G4syHs3M82E,Can you get a job without  a degree?
G4syHs3M82E,"As a supply chain analyst, I am both of them actually"
G4syHs3M82E,Very nice video. To the point!
G4syHs3M82E,"Our DA's are not allowed to interact with anyone lol we put them in a cell with a computer, sql, and water. The BA's, project managers, and senior directors go to them and say get me XYZ from SQL database. They send the raw data that is desperate converted to M excel, and that's it. Our DA don't know how the data correlates to the departments job because they get data orders from many departments all over the country! So the BA reads the data, interprets the data, format the data, and create business solutions based on that data for their team. Each team usually has one BA, while our DAs is an entire department by themselves. This is how Centene, number 48 company on the fortune 500 list, has things set up. I am currently a BA and I'm planning to transfer to DA in about 3-4 years.  I have an AA in business administration and will have a BA in technology management in 2 years. My certifications include business operations management, excel, and Data Analytics. Idk why I made this long ass comment lol"
G4syHs3M82E,This was so helpful thank you Alex!

https://youtu.be/aH2m5yxIiyY"
G4syHs3M82E,Thinking about going in this field but I’ve been working in warehouses since I was 18 as a simple package handler. Warehouse work is killing me mentally and physically. But I feel so under qualified for every job.
G4syHs3M82E,"I want to change career path for my Masters to study Data analysis and subsequently go to become a data analyst but I have a B.A French , is it possible?"
G4syHs3M82E,Thank you!
G4syHs3M82E,I disagree. I think in real life it’s the same exact job
G4syHs3M82E,I want the job that pays the most but has the least amount of responsibility.
G4syHs3M82E,"What if someone has a business background and obtains the skills of a data analyst?  That’s what I’m doing right now, I have degrees in business and I’m currently learning data analyst’s tools and knowledge."
G4syHs3M82E,Are business analyst and business intelligence analyst the same role?
G4syHs3M82E,Please can some recommend business analysis skill
G4syHs3M82E,"well... I pretty much do all the responsibilities you mentioned,  so what am I?   Data Business Analyst???  :)"
G4syHs3M82E,I'm sorry are you saying Anal-Lyst
G4syHs3M82E,Or you could just hire an data analyst that has social skills as opposed to the stereotypical introvert data nerd. 😂
G4syHs3M82E,"A nice short video, thank you. What would you say are the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?"
G4syHs3M82E,But do not these requirements for a data analyst position or for a data scientist? Skills like Azure/AWS for example...
G4syHs3M82E,"Hi Alex, i have a Bachelors in ICT and a Masters in IT Management. i have
 project Management experience, worked as a technical sales man and also IT  Technical support. I want to be an Analyst and need advise if my background will be better suited to a Business Analyst or Data Analyst. Thank You."
G4syHs3M82E,"I have these both skillset.. Sometimes, I am comparing which is better for me to pursue. But for me both are fine. Maybe the factor also based what is more in demand based on the corporate world needs."
G4syHs3M82E,Thank you for this video 😃
G4syHs3M82E,https://youtu.be/yHh_GrYIeGk
G4syHs3M82E,Thank you.  That was was very informative.
G4syHs3M82E,"Thank you for this, I'm a BA who wants to switch to a DA in a few months, so this helps me think of how to make my resume look more appealing."
appOFpF2pFg,Great video! I have a question. What are the courses I should take on free code camp to become a data analyst? Thank you and have a great day!
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi, as a someone who just wanted to start learning python, which one should I go through first?"
appOFpF2pFg,Hi Alex thank you very for sharing all the information. Do you have any class teaching data analysis? I’m following you and very interested to start a class with you. Please let me know. Best
appOFpF2pFg,Thank you so much sir lots of love to you
appOFpF2pFg,Thank you for this video.
appOFpF2pFg,Thanks
appOFpF2pFg,Appreciate this video Alex. Starting my journey on becoming a data analyst
appOFpF2pFg,"If I finish these courses, could I find an entry-level job?"
appOFpF2pFg,Thanks a lot for sharing! This has definitely saved my time. You are a savior
appOFpF2pFg,I have an issue where idk what to start with because I don't have a course outline. So should I just go SQL>tableau>python/r?
appOFpF2pFg,"4:20 You can use their free videos, but how much time are you going to have for that before your trial expires?"
appOFpF2pFg,"4:01 Sorry Alex, but I am going to have to disagree with you here. Power BI has Power BI Desktop, which is free. You can fool around with it, along with Power Query - a powerful (pun intended) tool to manipulate: clean/wrangle your data before creating your visualizations.
Tableau, on the other hand, costs to get into. Yes, you can get a 7-day trial, but realistically, how many Tableau courses can you finish in 1 week?

Therefore, I find Power BI to be more accessible to get into."
appOFpF2pFg,"Alex, or anyone else. I made a big mistake on my application. I was looking at my documents I had when I was applying for a data analyst position. I graduated with a bachelors degree in general studies, but decided to go back for my computer science degree and my masters in data analytics. 
So the thing is I used the computer science program when I should have used the degree I was actually conferred. This honestly was a mistake. I have the skills to become DA and my on boarding for the job is next Monday. Do you think the HR team will understand the mistake or will they simply just fire me. I really don’t know how to correct the error."
appOFpF2pFg,thank you 🙏🏻 🤍
appOFpF2pFg,Thank you for the wonderful videos.
appOFpF2pFg,"I also give my highest recommendation to the free Khan Academy ""Statistics & Probability"" or ""AP-Statistics"" curriculum.  (Fyi, there's substantial overlap of topics between the two.)  These are incredible, and every data analyst/scientist needs a solid statistics foundation."
appOFpF2pFg,What about excel? How can I learn excel for data analyst???
appOFpF2pFg,The one video I needed in 2021
appOFpF2pFg,"I'm only watching this because I saw an advertisement about taking 6 months' worth of schooling to learn data analytics. Unfortunately the price tag is 10,000 bucks.... I like free better."
appOFpF2pFg,Which is more popular/ used in the DA world? Mysql or Sql server? Which do you suggest learning first ?
appOFpF2pFg,new channel where i can learn new version.
appOFpF2pFg,please suggest new classes of sql
appOFpF2pFg,thankyou ....love from India..
appOFpF2pFg,Hey Alex how are you ? Hey can you tell me or someone what is the difference between taking a professional certification from Harvard and IBM ? It’s just that I want to take a Data Science certificate but in Harvard is expensive for me! And IBM offered same but cheaper is there something apart the prestigious? Or what should I do? Help me please with this I’ll appreciate it.
appOFpF2pFg,"Hey Alex.. Thanks for this information. 
Can you please guide which is the best course for SAP certification?"
appOFpF2pFg,"I always thought because w3 references world wide web it was pronounced as ""w three schools"""
appOFpF2pFg,Could you use the projects you do on Khan Academy in your portfolio? Just curious
appOFpF2pFg,Can one become a great Data  Analyst by using ONLY free resources?
appOFpF2pFg,Saved thank you kindly
appOFpF2pFg,"Dear Sir, 
Firstly, Thank you so much for your YouTube videos.
Would you please let us know best data scientist course online from scratch.
Thank you"
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for your videos. I recently made the decision to change my career into a Data analyst. I enjoyed your video on how you went from $20k to $100k. It seems very doable, keep up the great content!"
appOFpF2pFg,"Would you recommend learning SQL and Python at the same time, or is it better to concentrate on one or the other?"
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi, do you have any recommended books for Python for beginner?"
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi, do you have any recommended books for Python for beginner?"
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi Alex. First, i want to thank you for your videos. I came across your channel a few days ago, and instantly subscribed. I wanted to ask about the your other video 'Best online courses for data analyst' you mention Tableau in both videos. Would you suggest the Coursera course offered by UC Davis or the free course in this video? Thank you in advance and great work!"
appOFpF2pFg,Is Power BI recommended for Data Analysis because it appears more affordable when compared with Tableau?
appOFpF2pFg,thanks for the information. Where can i go to know what to start with like a syllabus? I would like to start studying.
appOFpF2pFg,"I have done intro to ML, statistics for data science courses which are theoretical, but done titanic surival prediction, iris data classification, bank customer churn prediction, bigmart sales prediction, projects
These projects seems like very basic. Can I go to interview with this work??"
appOFpF2pFg,what combo do u think would be better to learn simultaneously..SQL+Tableau  or SQL+Python ?   I have some experience with SQL and programming took a couple college classes for PHP and Visual basic.
appOFpF2pFg,Thank you Alex very useful.
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi Alex, i'm so glad I found your videos to feel better and be more motivated, especially your how-did-you-switch-career video. I have a question about that if you know and able to help, I work in a lab that test samples for hospitals and health centers. Do you know what options I have if I'm looking for a related job that works with data, like you worked in health care and then later your data jobs are related to what you did so you made a connection there. I just don't know how to look for something like that for me."
appOFpF2pFg,"Hi Alex,

Thank you for all you do. As an aspiring Data Analyst myself, I find your videos extremely helpful. Please in what order would you recommend a beginner take the SQL, Python and Tableau courses?

Also for data visualization what's your take on Power Bi. Is it worth developing some level of expertise in it in addition to Tableau?"
appOFpF2pFg,"Liked and saved.

I would point out one thing to those that will take these courses (including me).
Start with one course at a time and stick with it. Enrolling into a lot of courses will only get you confused and increase your chances of procrastination!"
appOFpF2pFg,thanks sir for guiding
appOFpF2pFg,"Awesome! I'm definitely checking out that professor's video on python. I know nothing so far, other than hello world lol"
appOFpF2pFg,Thank you Alex!
appOFpF2pFg,"You provided great resources to start with. Thank you.     
Alex, could you please suggest how I start with any SQL project to show my capabilities to interviewer.

As Microsoft SQL server exams going to closed very soon, do you suggest anything to replace other than cloud, as all companies still not accepted cloud fully.  Please share your thoughts 

Thanks again"
appOFpF2pFg,"Again, nice content Alex.
I can say that I was on the right track when I started to get info about Python since also watched CS dojo and other YouTube channel you featured here.
Thanks!"
appOFpF2pFg,"About Khan academy sql Course ,   Is  it  use  Ms sql server or  use another version of sql like My sql, T-sql ,.. ?"
appOFpF2pFg,"Go ahead Alex,  I'm enjoying watching ur  videos  <3}"
appOFpF2pFg,Another great video!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,What is the suggested order for taking these courses?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hi .. will I be able to do well if I am ain't good at mathematics and programming
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi, should we take this courses by the order you listed it or can we take each in no order?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I got a taste of Tableau recently.  So much potential!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"How much does this hold up now, October 2023?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I thought it would employee me
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"I am currently doing Google Data Analytics Certificate Courses on Coursera,  whats your suggestions? Do you think i can get something out of it? Thanks"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,is there a 2023 version of this?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,first I thought this is Johnny Sins
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hi Alex! Question: I’m considering taking the Google Professional Data Analytics course but I’m wondering if it’s a better investment in my time and money to just knock out the Udemy courses you recommend instead. I truly value and appreciate your insight. Thanks you!!!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi,

Are these courses still available?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I will be a Data Analyst!!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi Alex, I saw the preview of ""Python for Data Analysis and Visualization"" and it sounds like all the program is incorporate in the new MOOC ""Python for Data Science and Machine Learning"". Did you complete the 2 MOOCs? The second one explains every topics of the first one?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hello Alex, are these courses still valid to learn in 2022?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you! I'm also a fan of Jose Portilla's courses) learning Python  with him.
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Best channel for me so far!!! Thank you for the content
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi Alex! I am currently a nurse and looking to change careers without having to go back to school. From the research I did, I felt like Data Analyst could be a good fit. I was wondering what your thoughts were on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate versus other courses on Udemy/Coursera. I like the idea of having a certificate to put on my resume but would prefer to be proficient . Thanks!!"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Nice❤
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Regarding the first course you mentioned, Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization, the site says that you need to have basic Python skills. I don’t have any Python skills. Will that be a problem?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"hello ALEX, please after these learning is there a certificate presented to us"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you so much for this video. Very helpful
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Can you make some comments on the Postgraduate ""Data Science and Business Analytics"" course offered by UT Austin with collaboration Great learning? Can you compare it with any other available programs and make recommendations on which is better to take course? Please"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Are these courses suitable for any one to start learning data analysis from scrach?
Should they be taken in the same sequence you mentioned in the video?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thanks for such practical recommendations.
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi Alex! 
Thank you for your great video. 
My study will involve Bayesian data analytics. Do you have any recommendation of the course for it?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hello Mr. Alex, I want to ask you what is the best excel course available on the Internet, I found many courses, but I am wondering what should I choose?  Or what is the best course?  , All are good, of course, but what is the best course in your opinion?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Thank you for the wonderful content you provide, I want to ask you is there a specific order for the courses, I took the statistics course, but there are many things that depend on Excel and I am not good at Excel, so I wondered if there is a specific order?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Starting my Data Analyst journey!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hello Community! Please does Alex have any review on Udacity Data Analyst Nano degree? Please direct me if there's any. Thank you.
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Please does one have to do ALL the courses you mentioned? If yes, can you please arrange it in the other it should be taken?🙏🏾"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"hello Alex, thanks for all your help. I've been studying to prepare my self for data analyst and I've completed basic learning for all the software. which platform do you suggest best to get DATA ANALYST certification? google, IBM or udemy?

thanks"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Alex is the absolute best! Thank you!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"So happy I found you videos! I'm definitely looking into starting some type of training for Data Analysis so I an transition from my current job into something closer to the IT Field. 

I do have a question, I'm looking to use Coursera, which course should a beginner take first? Thank you in advance for your response ☺️!"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi, thanks for sharing information.
Is this everything that we need to know for beginners, so we can apply for junior job position?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,This was extremely helpful. I'm surprised the Google Data Analytics course wasn't mentioned. Perhaps it wasn't available at the time this video was created? I'm trying to shift careers from education to data analysis. Your videos have been a great guide! Thank you so much
B2SPC3Wz1R8,With a person with zero experience. after finishing this course. Is it hard obtaining a job in this field?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I really want Alex for the video. As one who is kin to learn data Analytic what is the appropriate line of courses to take and which one of these courses is the first
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Alex, thank you so much for the information it was so useful. I just have a question, I really hope you read this message. Is there any especial order you recommend to take all of this courses ? ( as I am new at this, sometimes I get confused in what order and which course I should review first)"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you for this video. I am a complete beginner and am excited to start!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hello...hope you are well 
How can I finish more than two courses a month please"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Awesome, Tahnk You so must. I looked into possible Data Analyst career, then I found this boot camp called Data Analyst Training Accelerator (DATA). It a  partnership with NYC’s Tech Talent Pipeline, it a 18 week program. My question is would this be a good course to take? Do you have a insight about this program?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Thank you very much for sharing this information, this Video is priceless"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hey Alex, would you take all these courses in addition to the google certification?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I have a doubt the course assignment/projects at end of this courses can be included in the resume?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,VERY EDUCATIVE I APPRECIATE I CAME ACROSS THIS VIDEO
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Really wanna learn this, but I don't even have a pc"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I am catching up with all your videos. Thanks again Alex. This is helping me a lot to where i want supposed to be
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"just purchased Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis.

Some of your videos helped me land my first job as a data analyst! Thanks for posting your content, Alex :)"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,How do you get the 85% discount on udemy courses?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Thanks for this.....But I would like to ask, before starting a data analyst journey, how much knowledge in excel is needed?
Must one know how to use excel very well?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Thank you so much,where can we find the link for the course?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you for sharing your videos and the Best Online Courses for Data Analysts.  I am so inspired....
B2SPC3Wz1R8,God bless you so much.
B2SPC3Wz1R8,u think Udemy data analyst courses r  good???
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hi Alex! Thanks so much for the amazing insights. Please guide me I am a blank beginner and which courses to take first in the number of orders above?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hello Alex. As an aspiring Data Analyst, do I need to learn data structures and Algorithms? especially if I want to get into internships/Jobs at multinationals. I don't think I've ever heard you mention it."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,In what order would you recommend taking the mentioned coursera courses?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi, I’m currently working on becoming a data analyst and just finished a course on Udemy, But I still feel like I’m lost in the aspect of knowing when to apply what or basically understanding the situation and understanding what the solution will be.pls I would love for you to mentor me, I won’t tk ur time just probably give me works or exercises to do to improve my understanding"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I'm going to start tomorrow my journey of self study to become a data analyst. I'm so excited for this! Wish me luck!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hi Alex! Thank you for all these resources. Would you recommend the data science career path in codecademy?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,wow!  The udemy courses are pretty expensive. Over $100
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thanks a lot! This was helpful
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi, what do you think of the Coursera/Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate? I'm considering changing career to either Data Analytics or coding. Looking for a course which would hold some weight / be accredited and industry recognised (if that's required). Thanks."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,hey mr where can i joint that website for statistics for data science and business analysis
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"thank you for the list Alex, i'll finisih all your videos first"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hey Alex, would you recommend doing these courses in the order presented?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi, Alex. Thanks for the eye opener. I am a novice in this career path, an Aspiring Data Analyst. I started a course on LinkedIn - How to become a Data Analyst sometimes ago, I am about to finish. Moreso, I asked someone on LinkedIn on what's next after this course, he told me I should start with SQL. Please, as expert on this career path, what do suggest I start with after finishing my course on LinkedIn? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,@Alex The Analyst . Do you have any recomendatons for R?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Sir, i have a graduation degree of Statistics. I know the basics of ""R"", SPSS. Is it necessary to learn "" python "" for data analyst???
Which is best tablaue or power BI??"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Quick question! I'm transitioning from my current job field (unrelated to my marketing degree), but I'm seeking a career as a marketing data analyst. I saw your video about the Google data analyst program, but what else might you recommend for someone wanting to get into data analysis specifically geared towards marketing?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hello.. I'm doing IBM data analyst professional course on Coursera , my question is only one course is enough to get an entry level job or should do something more."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"thanks for nice video the udemy page is however somehow broken. When I open it from  your link there is discount for that specific cousre after I add it to chart and log in, the discount fall off and it want full price out of nowhere. this doesn't encourage me to used that broken page again."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Has the ""Databases with SQL and data science"" course been discontinued? I can't find it on Coursera. There is a course called ""Databases with SQL and data science with Python"". The instructor is the same but the syllabus is different."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi alex, can you share the sequence for these courses. It would be really helpful. Thanks."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Great stuff..thanks for sharing
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"so basically ( and pls forgive ma little mind xd ) either i follow the udemy chain or coursera chain right ?! , and if it right what do u recommend , i can afford having both so money isn't a problem but obviously time will be a huge obstacle so which one should i dive in , and thx alot man for this vid. :)"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Thank you for your help. From South Africa
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Alex, I finished the Database and SQL for Data Science on Coursera. It took me 2 Days. The course was too easy, not enough knowledge to gain, and the Python part was poorly explained, glad it wasn't my first time working with an API.

I took a free PSQL course posted by FreeCodeCamp on youtube,  and it was better structured, more carefully explained, more information, and it took me around 6 hours to finish the 4 hours tutorial with pausing the video and playing with the queries.

Then I saw that on UDEMY, there are three begginer courses that stick out beside the one provided by you:
1. SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence  by 365 DataScience, they even have their own platform where they provide courses structured in modules and a verifiable certificate.

2.  The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2021: Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla

3. The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert by Colt Steele

Could you please review them? 
I would love your opinion!
Greetings from Romania!"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi Alex, are there any helpful videos for me to choose between ""data analytics"" program or ""Network operation"" program ? Thank you."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Ok, what should we start with first? Python? SQL? Should we know both, and what is your recommendation? I am a bit frustrated, because it took me almost 1 year until e start feeling comfortable with power bi… and i am 34. What do you think Alex?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,This channel is best for the people who love to play with data..!!
B2SPC3Wz1R8,hello I had a question is there are difference date analysis and date analyst. Please answer. thank you
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Hi Alex. Thanks buddy
B2SPC3Wz1R8,What IDE are you using for Python development?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"why didn't I find this channel before, totally loving it"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,You did not include Google data analysis professional certificate course although you are preferred it than IBM course in another vedio
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Alex can you suggest me some  ms excel Data analysis and visualization course from begginers in you tube  for a data analyst job ?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Hi Alex. Thanks for all this info. It's great cuz I believe I now know more about how to become a Data Analyst. However, you didn't touch on the certifications to obtain after all that learning. Could you help with that please?"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Wow Alex, this is the very first time I watched something about DATA ANALYSIS and got super excited. Great and concise presentation. To someone that doesn't have the background or degrees you mentioned, which course would you recommend taking first? Many thanks in advance!"
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Alex, great video.  Just want to add some context to Coursera's UC Davis Data Visualization With Tableau recommendation.  This is a great course to learn the fundamentals of data visualization, and what you learn will help you with whatever software you choose to utilize.  In the course, you will learn the basics of how to use Tableau, but this is not an in-depth how to do everything in Tableau.  Many students come into the course with that misperception and miss the platform-agnostic knowledge of visualizing data.  Again, great video, and thanks for sharing your journey."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Would you recommend the Udemy courses to be taken in the order that you show in your video or is there a better more effective way to take the courses. Which would you recommend for me to start with as I don’t have any knowledge or experience on data analytics. I was accepted to start my bachelors in Business analytics I’m just trying to jump in now rather than waiting.
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Is it best to initially learn Python by itself before incorporating the Data Analysis aspect?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Tysm for this video have been searching for this here and there but they all were really messed up . Tysm once again:)
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"Alex, the 1st course listed in your links has been updated and expanded. You may want to update your Udemy link."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,"I think your approach of individual courses is better than the certificate programs, though the IBM or Google one via Coursera would be a nice addition. Thank you so much for the info. Saving the video and the list.

My thinking:
1. Learn programming: Python, R, SAS
2. Learn spreadsheets: Excel, Google Sheets
3. Learn visualization: Tableau, Power BI
4. Learn to query: SQL
5. Learn Git and GitHub (putting projects there will help build portfolio)

A note to all: don't pay full price for Udemy courses. Wait until they go on sale, then buy a couple/few to hold you over until the next sale. If you are low income, Coursera offers financial aid. Have to answer 3 essay questions and wait 15 days to know whether approved or not. Have to apply for each course. Get on mailing lists of various learning platforms. Datacamp recently had 3 days free. Also, the first module of most courses is always free. Check out bundle packages on TNW (deals . thenextweb . com I think.) They even have ""pay what you want""."
B2SPC3Wz1R8,I’m starting a data analyst program through Marquette and Tableau tomorrow. Are you familiar with this program? What are your thoughts?
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Loved the video. Very helpful👍
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Would you recommend this over the GOOGLE data analytics course? I will be starting a Masters's in Data Science soon and I am looking to gain experience and knowledge beforehand.
B2SPC3Wz1R8,Just wondering if you ever looked at the Data analyst nano degree on Udacity. I wanted to know if they was worth the money?
fUpChfNN5Uo,While studying on platforms like Datacamp what or how many courses qualifies to a Masters Degree for a Data scientist
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi sir, nowadays jobs are replacing by AI and these jobs will replace AI in future ?  What was exactly happening in the IT field?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Nội dung quá tâm huyết luôn, sub ngay và luôn!"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Can you remake this in the wake of AI? 😢
fUpChfNN5Uo,"A Masters in some business area like economics is such a lower bar than BS in an engineering domain. A generic ""needs ANY Masters"" is such an arbitrary socio-economic driven false barrier."
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thanks Alex 🙏🏽
fUpChfNN5Uo,Wouldn't some responsibilities you describe for the Data Scientist role be associated of a Machine Learning Engineer?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Plz guide practically, What level of statistics is required in data analytics role?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,i just have a question... is the salary per annum or per month
fUpChfNN5Uo,Data Scientist vs Data Analyst | Which Is Right For You?
fUpChfNN5Uo,do you think any of these jobs will be replaced by AI?
fUpChfNN5Uo,Can one become a data analyst without qualification
fUpChfNN5Uo,Can I data scientist work as a data analyst
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi, I have a Bsc in Geology, I took courses in mathematics, physics and computer science during my 4 years Bsc. Is it possible to apply for data analytics for my masters program?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Thanks, Alex for making this video, you are amazing."
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Thanks Alex 
Your video is really informative but I do have a question? Is it possible to get a job as a data scientist even if i study data analytics in future after gaining some experience.as master of data science is too expensive for me to study"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Bro i need to know one thing about the bachelors degree 
Currently iam studying btech ece (electronics and communication engineering) can i become a data scientist or data analyst with that particular degree
I don't have interest in electronics and electrical stuff 
Is it possible please respond 😊"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"A lot of these companies don't know the differences, they could be looking for an Analyst but you end up performing Data Engineer and Data Scientist duties, that is they don't have the right infrastructure in place so you end up building pipelines to create your single point of truth before you can start any Analysis, after that is done, regular maintenance of you pipelines and analytics duties and soon enough adhoc queries of predictions, which becomes Data Scientist job"
fUpChfNN5Uo,beautifully explained thnks
fUpChfNN5Uo,Hi Alex as I’m a warranty executive in an automobile OEM core profile is to work on data…so please suggest me how it will be helpful for me to do data analyst course….I have diploma in automobile engineering…no graduation….also please suggest the best platform for same…from India🙏🏻
fUpChfNN5Uo,Really good advice
fUpChfNN5Uo,Can I take IBM data science course??? Is it worth it will I be able to learn data science with perfection
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi Alex. Can you please talk a bit about the importance of domain knowledge? In some industries, such as medical,  especially when  involves lab equipment, doing data analysis can be very challenging just because of the lack of context."
fUpChfNN5Uo,Jfc turn the gain up on the audio
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi Alex
I have just watched your video. It's very interesting. I have bachelor degree in Arts field, am I eligible for Data analytics?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,This was a great presentation . Thank you Alex
fUpChfNN5Uo,"That is a very great way of telling about the difference between data scientists and data analysts. I came across with more professional one 😅 I think this one is more like general differences https://youtu.be/Sb_z0fP3ZLA Here, they also adds future aspects of both in the ChatGPT world 😮"
fUpChfNN5Uo,so which one should i choose as a non-IT background person ?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"I graduated with a master's in data science in 2022 in an effort to break into the data career space. My program focused on learning Python and data manipulation with Pandas, and then jumped right into machine learning. I learned nothing about using Tableau or Power BI to create data models, reports, or dashboards. I learned nothing about the distinctions between data analyst, data scientist, or machine learning engineer. In my job search, my master's in data science has impressed precisely NO ONE!"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Wanna see how data analysts are going to live with the advance of ai 😂
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Dear Alex, I had done a dispensing optician course back in 2012 and got a job as an optician but I did not like it. I am currently doing administrative work for a very small organization. They are on ground level with their website and needed me to update it. I work with the computer engineer who designed the website and he started teaching me how to code. Iam still learning with him. I also did a basic computer course in microsoft office. I like problem solving a lot and math and I was looking up careers involving those traits and data analytics came up. Then I stumbled upon your videos and I was astounded that they were free to learn the basics of the field. Thank you for making it available and my goal is to become exceptionally well at the skills you recommended follow your videos and apply for a job. I don't have a degree but I do have determination."
fUpChfNN5Uo,"It seems like Data Science is well suited for financial markets whereas Data Analyst is more general business.

True?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi Alex, i am 36 yo and i have a degree in accounting and finance and currently working as a business analyst in a commercial bank. I want to switch career to data science. Is it a good idea? If yes, Where should i start from?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Go with what you want to be.
fUpChfNN5Uo,voice is low
fUpChfNN5Uo,I shall subscribe 😊
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hello good morning from here, my name is Chidinma, thanks for all you do, I just watched your video and really need some clarifications.

I'd soon be rounding up my bachelors in public health, I'd love to integrate technology with public health, i feel I can only do this with Data Science because of the predictive solutions to solve health problems (Disease detection), I don't have a STEM background, does it still make sense going for Data Science straight on? Or navigating through Data analytics? 

Ps: I do have an intermediate knowledge of SQL."
fUpChfNN5Uo,"What a Great video, way to Go, all I need regarding both fields in nutshell, thanks a lot Alex."
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Dear Sir, I want to thank you for all those videos you made and for your magic explanations.. please help me ! I am 38 old and I have a phd in biomedical engineering and I want to shift my career into data analysis or into data science and machine learning. What do you recommend? Do you think I can do this at this age ? BIG THANKS"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Hi Alex and everybody . do you know if companies would hire people who are interested in data science and enrolled in courses but they have a business profile?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Alex, Thanks for clearing lots of doubt!!!"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"I have a bachelors in mathematics and it is the whole reason I got interested in data analysis.

Initially, I wanted to be an airline pilot!

 I'm considering getting a masters in data science because I feel that data science will not involve PROOF WRITING AND ADVANCED THEORETICAL MATHEMATICS lol (which is PAIN, there are still unsolved problems today).

Anyway, if I get the master's, I'm definitely going to pursue a career as a data scientist. Currently, I'm about to start my first data analyst role. I already started learning a thing or two about Linear Regression (supervised learning) in Machine Learning and although you just told me that I won't be using it in this role I feel that I should stay the course and keep learning anyway because if/when I go to take my masters, I'll already know things and that's LIT. :)"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Is it possible to start as a Data analyst and later in the career switch to Data scientist?

The Data scientist sounds way more interesting (not just because of the pay), however, I am missing the Master's degree....."
fUpChfNN5Uo,"me too my name is Alex
we have a lot in common
I am also bald, I wear glasses and I study CS.
it's like looking at the best version of myself"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"hey alex, i am from a finance background academically including economics, statistics and computer  science. So should i continue with data analyst plan or an data scientist considering the fact I will not be studying physics and higher levels of education.
Other people are free to help in the comments. 
thank you <3."
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Great video Alex, just wondering are Engineers elligible to become a data analst? because my future job title is Engineer & Data Analyst, surprisingly."
fUpChfNN5Uo,so alex can i be a data analyst just buy watching online course even i am not a computer science student?
fUpChfNN5Uo,Data science is for me
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thanks for your inform bro. It's help me a lot to knowing what's the different.
fUpChfNN5Uo,Do you have to give presentations as a Data Analyst?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Thanks,"
fUpChfNN5Uo,what is a dashboard?  what goes into making/modifying it?
fUpChfNN5Uo,Low audio
fUpChfNN5Uo,"This 7:49 minutes video was indeed helpful to me. infact, it was more like an eye opener. Thanks alot man. I hope to implement diligently the knowledge gained from the data anlaytics courses i'm currently enrolled into, and finally land a job as a data scientist few years from now."
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thank you
fUpChfNN5Uo,"If I give myself 360 days one year, can I become a data analyst? If so, can you give me an idea of what I need to learn"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Im engrossed with your channel! Love how dedicated you’re to educating all of us!
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Is there any difference between data analyst & business analyst, if there are any differences does companies only recruiting the candidates who possess the required skills of the both roles?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thank you so much for your clarifications about the differences and similarities between a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. This is a great video =)
fUpChfNN5Uo,"People like yourself, Luke and stevefonic something are so inspirational that help me keep my motivation up... ✊🏽"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thanks for all this information. I am a student getting masters in Data Analytics what is a good company to get an internship with?
fUpChfNN5Uo,Would a degree in Business Analytics qualify you for both roles?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi #AlexTheAnalyst.
I’ve got two questions to ask you. I have watched lots of your videos that I like, and learned a lot. 
My question is do you think that the certificate that Datacamp provides for data science is worth to earn, and would it help me to find a data science job?
And, what online site do you recommend to get a certificate for data science with cheap price? 
Thank you."
fUpChfNN5Uo,You are really doing the most for your viewers. I love your content.
fUpChfNN5Uo,Hey! Which path would you recommend for medical industry/research? Data science or data analytics?
fUpChfNN5Uo,do you need to be good at math to become a data analyst or data scientist? could you get by with an average math knowledge from high-school?
fUpChfNN5Uo,completely misleading!
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thank you for this information.
fUpChfNN5Uo,Thank you sir
fUpChfNN5Uo,"I’m An expert in python ,  but  I don’t have a degree I took a couple assessments , I scored in the 97th percentile on the DataCamp assessment. Now I you telling me it’s impossible to become a data scientist with out a degree???"
fUpChfNN5Uo,I have a question. I have a bachelors in data science but I don't wanna continue data science as a masters. Can I become a data analyst and then become a data scientist later on or is a masters necessary for becoming a data scientist?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hey, I’d like to know if as a mechanical engineer my undergrad degree would be considered for a data scientist role."
fUpChfNN5Uo,Can you r suggest if google data analytics professional certificate worth doing to get into the field?
fUpChfNN5Uo,Just wondering for someone who is about to make a career switch and learning about being a data analyst but dont know where to begin what is the best thing you can do?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"For Data Scientist, is it just any MSc/PhD or must be in CS/IT?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Any videos on certifications to get for either of these fields?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"I have a Masters in Analytics, Python, R, SQL, testing, ml regression, Radom Forests, Neural Networks, etc... So where do I fit in? I think I'm a Data Scientist."
fUpChfNN5Uo,amazing content as always
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi I enjoyed your channel. I have a ques here on the language, does the industry use python or R more? Or excel and mysql is more than enough to do the job?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Sir I have bachelors in statistics and masters in mathematics with 50%. And I am 27 years old, zero work experience, can I become data scientist with ibm data science certification?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Hi Alex,
You mentioned in the 5 Reasons Not to Become a Data Analyst video that it's a people-heavy profession, and that misanthropes won't enjoy it much. What about data scientists? Could I become a successful data scientist as an asocial loner?"
fUpChfNN5Uo,what bachelors would go well with an assoc in project management?
fUpChfNN5Uo,The salary amount is it per month or per year?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"i appreciate this video, thank you for the clarity on all the questions i had... in a single video :)"
fUpChfNN5Uo,thoughts on data science bachelors program?
fUpChfNN5Uo,I feel like these jobs are trivial.
fUpChfNN5Uo,Can we become Data Analyst without any Degree??
fUpChfNN5Uo,Which aws certification would you recommend?
fUpChfNN5Uo,Impressive . Can  a geography degree holder study Data science?
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Great video!
What is data engineer? Skills needed 
Please make video"
fUpChfNN5Uo,I'll for been a data analyst
fUpChfNN5Uo,Your explanation skill is excellent it’s is more premium then any premium one .
fUpChfNN5Uo,This video well explains the difference data scientist and data analyst.  Thanks so much Alex!
fUpChfNN5Uo,"I already have a BA In something else and I’m taking a 9 month boot camp for data scientist. Honest opinion, will this get me a good job ? I know it’s not a lot of detail.. but what do you think of boot camp intensives ? Thanks 🙏🏽"
fUpChfNN5Uo,Well explained. Thank you Alex.
fUpChfNN5Uo,Informative video but the sound of the video is too low for me.
fUpChfNN5Uo,There is right term. They hire you as an scientist but can give you analyst tasks. Be ready to be both :)
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Courses in Russia be like: become a data analyst in 3 months, no knowledge of statistics needed
Me learning statistics, coding and econometrics: no, thank you"
fUpChfNN5Uo,you dont need a masters or PHD to be considered a Data Scientist
fUpChfNN5Uo,"Thanks Alex for all the advice, I finally landed a job as a data analyst at a tech startup. If anyones interested, I made 143 applications, had 7 interviews and got 3 offers. The process from starting the google course to landing a job took just under 3 months (I was unemployed and working on this full time). Hope that helps anyone who's looking for their next job!"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"I'm using MySql workbench on Mac and I had to use the CONCAT function in order to put the first and last names together. I'm confused aren't you using MySQL also, and so why didn't the + work for me then?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Hi Alex. You channel is amazing and helps me a lot to understand SQL easier. I have a question: what if I put a prefix or suffix on every table column, so they never repeat names? Is it a good practice? Does is make any difference at all?

For example:
[Employee]
    emp_id
    emp_name
    emp_document
...
[Salary]
    sal_id
    sal_emp_id
    sal_value
....

Thanks in regards!"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Short and effective
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Yes yes YES!!! That thing about using a, b, c to aliasing tables makes everything so confusing, thank you for pointing that out because now I feel so much more confident to use actual labels as alias."
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thank you so much Alex straight to the point and simple. Grateful for you.
Please is there a video where you show an example of sub-queries and aliasing. Using the right alias at the different levels of nesting. For example

Select emp.* 
From
        (select a.* 
        From 
               ( select col1,... col1 
                from employees as emp)  as a where ....
) as vw_emps_without_a


I believe in this case saying select emps.* on the first line is wrong the correct thing to use will be vw_emps_without_a.*. 
This will make more sense as to why aliasing if JOINS where involved, this is just a shortened example."
Dk7he_yEs4U,That is very helpful video for beginners big THANK YOU ALEX❤
Dk7he_yEs4U,"""Your positive attitude and teamwork have made a significant impact."
Dk7he_yEs4U,thank you so much!
Dk7he_yEs4U,This is great! Very clear after practicing completing your same exercises!
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Of all things, Aliasing is my favorite"
Dk7he_yEs4U,THANKS
Dk7he_yEs4U,Hi Alex. This course is very good. What kind of SQL did you use in this course?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"HI ALEX SIR , HOW ARE YOU ? LOVE FROM INDIA"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"I disagree on your opinion on lettering joins. The reason being is that if my join list gets to be 5, 6, 7 tables then I have an idea of where the table is in the join list as long as I adhere to that alphabetic order. So if I see my column is in table D or E then I can quickly look down the list to find that table. The alias does not readily tell you what the table's full name and path are. What if you have similarly named tables in more than one schema? What if you are not familiar with these tables. If I letter them I can quickly figure out where in my join I put the table. I've also run into enough issues where too many of the tables are named almost identically.  I also think that putting too many letters in your alias also defeats the purpose of aliases. Aliases are there to clean up the code and shorten the column names.
I can see renaming later after you've developed it, but when trying to code all of this it clears confusion as to where the join is."
Dk7he_yEs4U,really thank you for making this confusing aliasing queries looks easy ❤
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank you 😊
Dk7he_yEs4U,"For anyone who's getting 0 as a result of FullName concatenation CHANGE ""+"" with ""||"".

Some databases use || for string concatenation instead of +."
Dk7he_yEs4U,thank you
Dk7he_yEs4U,really helpful🔥
Dk7he_yEs4U,Tip For anyone using MySQL:  use CONCAT() function instead of '+' to combine the column names.
Dk7he_yEs4U,I used that but the output is showing EmployeeID and salary without Items inside. Where did I go wrong?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Just a small tip, Aliases can't be used as a filter condition in the WHERE clause. Ex: let's say you merge first_name and last_name and name the column as full_name, you cant go like, WHERE full_name like '%A' (full_name starting with A),   IT WONT WORK. but, it works with Order By. Hope it helps.   P:S Experience based on MYSQL only, not sure about others."
Dk7he_yEs4U,You. Are. The. Best.
Dk7he_yEs4U,Excellent stuff here!! Very easy to grasp on to.
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank you so much Alex for the knowledge. I am now a fast learner.
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Dumb question, why something like this can't work? 

SELECT Avg(EmployeeSalary) 
WHERE EmployeeJobTitle = 'Accountant'
 AS AVG_ACC_Salary 
FROM EmployeeSalary 

Getting error: Msg 156, Level 15, State 1, Line 112
Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'as'."
Dk7he_yEs4U,"So glad you mentioned the letter aliasing as abstract. 
As I'm  someone who is trying to familiarize myself with a lot of tables in our CRM, looking at queries where letter aliasing has been done, takes a bit more time and can be frustrating at least for me."
Dk7he_yEs4U,"5:25 I realized that you have Demo. First Name twice, i think the second one was supposed to be Demo.LaatName"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Hey Alex i Just wanna Thank u MAN!! MY MAN!!!
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank you Alex for your dedication
Dk7he_yEs4U,"On my journey through the boot camp...

Thanks for telling that using a,b, & c aliases won't give enough context."
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank you Alex for giving such a good playlists for learning SQL in free ❤️❤️❤️.
Dk7he_yEs4U,thanks
Dk7he_yEs4U,"This is not a hard subject, but confusing, at least for me. I saw a LinkedIn course on SQL and I saw aliasing there. The instructor was using ""a."", ""b."" and ""c."" and to say I was confused is an understatement! Thanks for the video! makes a lot more sense now"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"You explained really well however, the best part of the video was your database...lol"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"hi, can anyone explain to me why there's a bracket on the table name? is that optional or something? sorry i tried both and both works the same i'm just asking because maybe theirs a special reason behind it."
Dk7he_yEs4U,This is impossible.
Dk7he_yEs4U,*Tip* For anyone using PostgreSQL- use '||' instead of '+' to combine the column names.
Dk7he_yEs4U,why are they in square brackets?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thanks a lot coach , i have a question if i wanna bring the data that i removed , how can i do it please  ?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thanks Alex!
Dk7he_yEs4U,"So I see you used + for the concatenation does || also work cos thats what i usually use for oracle sql. Was wondering if that works mssql. I am an oracle apex developer and this bootcamp is really good. I do some side analysis sometimes as the work requires but Im having more of a ""oh so this is why its this way"" moments with your tutorials. Its really great!"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Beautiful
Dk7he_yEs4U,Easy and helpful I like how I can organize everything the way I want now
Dk7he_yEs4U,how can I get the dataset for practice?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thanks for your videos but I do have a question. In this video the table names have brackets, like [SQLTutorial].[dbo], and I was just curious as to why? I haven't seen that in any of your earlier videos so I was wondering what the difference is. Thanks!"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thanks
Dk7he_yEs4U,"How can I like this million times😁
Thanks for all you do Alex🙌"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Done
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thanks.
In the Select statement of the first line in the last two queries, I think there is a typing error. Because both are Demo.FirstName and the second entry should be Demo.LastName?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Hi Alex, thanks for the video. I tried aliasing the firstname and lastname with the SELECT FIRSTNAME + '  ' + LASTNAME AS FULLNAME ON MYSQL but it gave me 0 as the FULLNAME. I checked my data types and they are VAR CHAR.. dunno what to do.. is there a different query for MySQL?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank so much Sir
Dk7he_yEs4U,Thank you Sir
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thank you, Alex. I love how you refer to real-life on-the-job cases in your explanation."
Dk7he_yEs4U,How its Intermediate? it pure basic no? sorry.
Dk7he_yEs4U,I still find this topic difficult
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thank you so much, Alex"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Hi Alex, thanks for this class!  
Pls how can I carry out  the ""Insert operation""?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Great job!!!!!
Dk7he_yEs4U,Im going steady
Dk7he_yEs4U,Not going to lie. It took me 2-3 times to watch this videos to undertsand the concept of Aliasing but I belive I understant it better. Can't wait to start ona  project to practice this concept.
Dk7he_yEs4U,How come in this video some of it is in brackets?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"I am glad I am not the only one that gets frustrated when someone simply uses a single letter to define a Table alias. I thought my frustration with that was just me being a beginner. I am glad an expert, such as yourself, feels the same way. I feel better now! Great videos by the way! I am working my way down the entire SQL playlist. Are you by chance also fluent in Python and have plans to do a Python playlist in the future?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"At work, I've used the single letters to refer to tables and so have some colleagues of mine, but I think you make a good point that it's too abstract and gets confusing the longer the script gets.  I'm going to make sure I do it the way you suggested from now on."
Dk7he_yEs4U,Hey Alex. Can you please tell as to why are you putting brackets for [SQLTutorial] and [dbo]? Third line at 5:09. I'm new to this stuff. A little help please?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Been using SQL for a while - most of my collogues and I still use a,b,c as alias - Haha"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"1:16 for anyone using MySQL:

SELECT CONCAT (FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName
FROM employeedemographics;"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thank you very much for these SQL courses
We look forward to learning from the following
I hope it will come very soon"
Dk7he_yEs4U,I binged all of your SQL tutorials to give myself a refresher. I'll be eagerly waiting for your Advanced tutorials and SQL portfolio videos!
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Hey Alex. Hope you are doing well.
Thanks for this amazing series on Intermediate SQL. Excited to get more like these.. specifically the advanced topics you mentioned in the first video. Your demos are really quick and easy to understand their syntax, functioning and application. Thanks a lot. 😊"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Hi alex, i am your  truly subscriber from INDIA !!! Always love your details analyzing of the topics. But i am Eagerly waiting for the intermediate & advance SQL videos since long....and also desperately waiting for the project .......Thanks..."
Dk7he_yEs4U,Awesome! Upload more videos like this!
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Thanks so much, will you continue with the final project you mentioned at the beginning of the series 🍁"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Do have any other tips or skills that are little more advanced that would be good to have. Like using Visual studio SSIS, macros in Excel or PowerBI. Basically beside from the regular SQL, Python, Excel, PowerBi is there any programs or features you use that you feel like add value to your career?"
Dk7he_yEs4U,Hello. Where I can find intermediate topics in SQL?
Dk7he_yEs4U,"Cool Alex, thanks for the video!"
Dk7he_yEs4U,"I have experience of working in SQL on Oracle DB, and some of the keywords are different between this and oracle SQL db.... does it make any difference in interview"

ziurEoqEcO4,"This is really a very helpful one. Thank you very much, Alex."
ziurEoqEcO4,"Thank you, Alex!"
ziurEoqEcO4,"Thank you Alex! Keep it up, these videos are so helpful! Greetings from Taiwan."
ziurEoqEcO4,So how much do you get paid??? I’m an analyst myself and just curious . Also what city do you live cost of living makes a diff

ziurEoqEcO4,Thanks Alex
ziurEoqEcO4,"This is so helpful.
Thanks Alex.!"
rLKC--8UYSw,"Haha, there are quite a few parallels with dating - especially the part where you dont wanna come out desperate"
rLKC--8UYSw,I died laughing at 4:42 LOL
rLKC--8UYSw,Where do you see yourself in 5 years? hopefully out of here.
rLKC--8UYSw,Hi Alex! Really appreciate all the videos you have put up. You are by far the best teacher on here regarding data analytics. I wanted to ask you... For a typical data analyst role how many rounds of interviews are there? I havr heard some companies have case study rounds.. How would you go about them? It would be really useful if you made a video on that. Thanks!
rLKC--8UYSw,Alex thank you so much for your videos.  Your channel is the perfect place to start studying Data Analysis.
rLKC--8UYSw,"it's Valuable information, I have passed ""before Data analyst"" through a lot of interviews, and you just say the best scenario."
rLKC--8UYSw,Hey Alex I just got a SQL assement for a job interview any way you can look over it / give me tips on how I should approach it? Would be very helpful I really want this job
rLKC--8UYSw,Thanks Alex. I have an interview tomorrow 🤞🏽
rLKC--8UYSw,"How do you feel about someone bringing in a notebook journal during an interview? For example, suppose I want to ask several questions... rather than sit and remember, I can just look at my notes (not read them off robotically, but try to work the conversation towards it)."
rLKC--8UYSw,I was waiting for the SQL questions to get hard. I guess I could be a data analyst if I wanted to be 😁👍
rLKC--8UYSw,"I really have perfectionism as my main weakness :)
More specifically obsessive compulsive personality disorder, but I'm fighting in my mind to produce ""good enough"" and not never ready ""perfect"" product."
rLKC--8UYSw,"Hi Alex. Was there a Video on python interview questions and answers? The sql one was great, prepared me for my interviews."
rLKC--8UYSw,The most explicative video on Data analytic I am subsscribing
rLKC--8UYSw,"Thanks! I see there are the really obvious ones like not talking bad about my previous employer, but the one that really may have saved me was telling me I shouldn't say ""I don't have a lot of experience but I'll learn."" I literally said that in an interview, now I know better."
rLKC--8UYSw,Great video thank you! Help me reflect on the past interview mistakes I had.
rLKC--8UYSw,gonna use that greatest weakness answer. thank you Alex
rLKC--8UYSw,"Thanks, Alex. Great video. Took some good thoughts from it"
rLKC--8UYSw,Thanks💖
rLKC--8UYSw,"Hi Alex,
Thank you so much for these tips. Listening to you is so easy. It comes out naturally. You know, like how ti feels to watch Grey's Anatomy. Relatable and easy to understand."
rLKC--8UYSw,I'm sorry but simply looking at the bullet points is enough
rLKC--8UYSw,"Great videos as always Alex, I like your simple approach in your vids so thanks again. Do you think you'll ever do a live Q and A, or something similar to that?"
rLKC--8UYSw,hey Alex appreciate all the videos they've been quite helpful. I have a question about how much knowledge to have in python. Right now I'd say i'm pretty comfortable with data cleaning and data visualizations. Is there anything else you'd say is necessary or helpful that i can try and learn for a data analyst role? I know SQL is probably the most important skill but just want to be prepared with Python skills as well so i'm not stumped in an interview or anything. Thanks man.
rLKC--8UYSw,"Hi Alex loving your videos, I'm more on the bioinformatics side and want to go into a career in data as the two are really related, also the full skillset of a data analyst would be a really good video as previously mentioned"
rLKC--8UYSw,"Thanks for sharing !! I am going to have a data analyst interview in 2 hours, and the manager just sent me an email and asked me about the expected salary. LOL, waiting for the next video!"
rLKC--8UYSw,Hi sir please make a video on full skills for data analyst
sua7xKN0cPc,Davis Joseph Hall Mary Walker Lisa
sua7xKN0cPc,Rodriguez Sharon Hall Frank Lopez Jessica
sua7xKN0cPc,thanks alex
sua7xKN0cPc,"Wait i just started learning sql a month ago, are data analyst questions going to be this easy?"
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hi Alex, thanks for all you do but it would have been very helpful for you to give examples of how you would amswer the questions."
sua7xKN0cPc,I have no experience in the data analytics world yet. Im finishing my bootcamp and i am on a job hunt.  Some of the broad questions I cant even answer since I have no experience in Data analysis projects except the ones in the bootcamp.
sua7xKN0cPc,So helpful. Thank you.
sua7xKN0cPc,Are these questions still relevant or do they ask difficult questions for an entry level data analyst role ?
sua7xKN0cPc,Thank You very much!
sua7xKN0cPc,"Correct me if I'm wrong but i dont think you need to add the group by or order clause to get the max price at the end of that query. I think you just need SELECT Drug_Name, Max(Drug_Price)
FROM table. I tested this theroy out while using w3schools SQL training course,BUT EXCELLENT VIDEO!!! THIS IS HELPING OUT ALOT."
sua7xKN0cPc,Hey have you ever thought about doing a VBA tutorial ?
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hello Alex,

Thanks for great video and Q&A for SQL, those where very helpful. And thank you for all  the great content regarding data analytics :)

You mentioned at this video that you could make another video about Python interview questions. I could not find it on your channel, so I wanted to ask you if you can maybe direct me to it or, if not, could you maybe recommend some good video somewhere else which, in your opinion, covers well this topic?

Once again, thanks for great videos and keep up with good work!"
sua7xKN0cPc,unnecessary to repeat question i can read myself on the screen
sua7xKN0cPc,"Thank you dearly, Alex."
sua7xKN0cPc,Informative & useful clip. Please also create Python Interview Q & A. Thanks Alex.
sua7xKN0cPc,Alex the epic!
sua7xKN0cPc,"If only the questions during the interviews I've attended were so simple! Nevertheless, thank you Alex."
sua7xKN0cPc,you should hide the ribbon in word for this.. but other it was OK..
sua7xKN0cPc,"Thanks a lot for your great contents. I am a newbie in the data analytics world, so happy that i found your videos. 😊"
sua7xKN0cPc,Totally incredible. Love the document
sua7xKN0cPc,I saw this video 2 days ago and I can proudly say that I am already able to understand and answer the basic questions. And I understand little of the intermediate questions. And the difficult questions I still don't understand much but I do understand enough but I am unable to answer them without taking a while to think
sua7xKN0cPc,You are the best !
sua7xKN0cPc,Welcome
sua7xKN0cPc,Thanks Alex this insightful
sua7xKN0cPc,I feel like some of these questions are worded strangely.
sua7xKN0cPc,"I'm so glad people like you exist! As someone who's currently trying to do a career, this right here is like finding treasure. Love your content and the great work you've done to help all of those who are aspiring Data Analysts!"
sua7xKN0cPc,nice one alex.
sua7xKN0cPc,I could be hired as a senior data analyst with my sql skills right now 🙃 these questions are nothing
sua7xKN0cPc,Would love a part 2 to this video
sua7xKN0cPc,"So for beginner question 3, why do we ORDER BY Drug_Name? Wouldn't we want to ORDER BY Drug_Price?"
sua7xKN0cPc,"Thanks Alex! I will be interviewing next week, fingers crossed"
sua7xKN0cPc,Good video 👍
sua7xKN0cPc,7:15 why select dispensed drug from patient table? It exists in drug table
sua7xKN0cPc,Thanks for including video of yourself as you talk. This makes the video much more enjoyable and engaging. I've had companies ask me questions for a Data Engineer type role and get into DBA level stuff. LOL It was painful. You just never really know what some companies are going to throw at you.
sua7xKN0cPc,Thank you for this. Grt videos and tutorials. I have been watching and learned so much already.
sua7xKN0cPc,"Thanks,..,...but could you please slow the pace down a bit when you answer the questions ..."
sua7xKN0cPc,thank you sir its really helpful and am sure that it's really helpful in my upcoming interview... your simply great I just like the language that you explain about any topic.. just go ahead and thank you very much again..
sua7xKN0cPc,"can Q3 be done using the below query?

select Drug_name,Drug_price 
from table
group by drug_name,Drug_price
having max(Drug_price)"
sua7xKN0cPc,"Thank you for the video!
I was wondering If I knew how to do all the intermediate queries.
is it enough to do a real world business data analysis in Tech companies?"
sua7xKN0cPc,What if you have no experience what would you say?
sua7xKN0cPc,This is so helpful. What's ur linkedIn name..couldn't find it
sua7xKN0cPc,This is much more accurate compared to the other interview video
sua7xKN0cPc,"Thank you Alex, this has been very helpful"
sua7xKN0cPc,"Alex, in Q3 I am assuming that Drug_name would be a unique value. So how would we group a unique value? I was thinking of using order by drug_price desc and select top 1"
sua7xKN0cPc,Yes! Please make python questions!
sua7xKN0cPc,"Is there a Chart/Table somewhere that explains what is Beginner, intermediate, and Advanced SQL?"
sua7xKN0cPc,thanks
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hi Alex!
Thank you so much for all the content you're putting out here! I wanted to ask how one could further their experience in using SQL? I'm currently learning SQL through DataCamp--I now know how to query data, how to window functions, and the likes. Though I believe that I'm ahead than my previous self, I seriously believe that execution is where I can truly further it,  are there any platform where I could execute and practice on it? And I'm also curious about the first question, what knowledge should I have for it to be a 10? I hope to learn more from you!"
sua7xKN0cPc,I was so relieved when I heard the entry level questions.. I took a course on Google sheets where they used some queries so the answers mostly made sense to me . Faith restored!
sua7xKN0cPc,This video is really helpful. Thank you. Is there a python interview video for beginners too?
sua7xKN0cPc,Alex. Can you post the most asked interview computer coding assessment for  healthcare data analyst for claims.
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hi Alex, would you be able to make a similar video to this for Python questions? Thanks again for these videos!"
sua7xKN0cPc,"omg i just switched to data science as a management graduate i thought i didnt have what it takes but i practically answered 80% of these questions right , i think it might be just time to start interviewing for jobs , i also know excel , tableau and have a large knowlege of python ( pandas , numpy , matplotlib) i cant code yet but i know most of the models and grand lignes , what do you think i should do ?"
sua7xKN0cPc,Please do a Python Q & A for Data Analyst roles. Your videos are INCREDIBLE!
sua7xKN0cPc,Very useful info mate. I am starting to process of changing carrers and you have been incredibly useful :) Thanks
sua7xKN0cPc,"i'm almost done UDACITY NANO degree .. do you think i will be able to compete and have a good chance to be a data analyst?? 
really need you answer"
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hey Alex, I guess this will also work. Please let me know if I'm wrong. Cheers. 

select drugname from drugstable where drugprice = (select max(drugprice) from drugstable) ;"
sua7xKN0cPc,This is really helpfuI! I was trying to gauge my sql for entry level data analyst jobs and this has given me a good idea. Thanks for sharing.
sua7xKN0cPc,"Found you through a sub on Reddit!  Your videos have been very helpful in evaluating my tech skills as a data analyst. While I’ve been in a BI/analyst role for 9 years using SQL, Business Objects, Tableau and Excel of course. I think I’m a mid-level/intermediate SQL. Not sure I have the aptitude to be advanced or learn programming like Python."
sua7xKN0cPc,"Alex, this is awesome material. I'm currently in a position where part of my job is doing data analyst work and the other more of a business analyst. I will like to move more towards the data analyst role. As far as SQL goes, what is a list of things we must know for a mid-level position. Things such as joins, unions, stored procedures, etc. There is so much to SQL but will like to know if there are areas that you would recommend where one should be really strong in for a mid-level position. Thank you!"
sua7xKN0cPc,"I have an upcoming interview for a data analyst role and these videos are great! I'm brushing up on SQL and BI tools, still a bit nervous getting into the interview for a dynamic role. Would appreciate any tips on interview prep, core skills and analytical skills to practice, thanks!"
sua7xKN0cPc,"I was searching for a mentor and guess what, I've found one. You are a blessing. Thank you so much for such clarity. As a self-starter data analyst, I have been facing imposter syndrome since quite a long time, but watching this has motivated me to keep working."
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hey Alex, I'm from India. I just went through some websites telling about the salaries for Data Analyst. I observed that in India , the average salary is much low like ₹5,00,000 and in USA it is $45k. What do you think should still pursue my dream to be a data analyst? Because this salary is very less. And what are the chances that I would get job in USA? 
Please reply I'm worried."
sua7xKN0cPc,"Hi Alex , I'm in  first year of my  graduation right now and looking for an entry level internship  but I don't know what experience should I  put into  my  resume  as a fresher.  Please tell !"
sua7xKN0cPc,This is a really good video to watch if you have an interview coming up.  I appreciate your efforts in making this video Alex and it would be great if you could also add some broad questions about databases.
sua7xKN0cPc,Hi Alex its a great video on SQL interview questions.Really Appreciate your efforts it will be great if you make Python Data Analyst interview questions as well....
sua7xKN0cPc,"Alex, your video came to my mind on where do you see jobs by 2030? What percentage of the industry will be related to data analytics? 50% or more? This is just a reality check for me."
sua7xKN0cPc,"This is really helpful since I've been meaning to get my hands on some ""real world"" interview questions to evaluate myself. Thanks for doing this."
sua7xKN0cPc,Thank you for the video. This is super helpful. Please make a Python interview question for data analyst interview too.
sua7xKN0cPc,Thanks for the video.  As an analyst that is just starting to use SQL I feel better about my skills since I was able to answer all your questions.
sua7xKN0cPc,I like the selection of questions you shared. 😊
sua7xKN0cPc,"As a recent graduate that’s trying to get a entry job/internship as a data analyst, I appreciate you making these helpful videos"
fweZQqB0nwQ,Be sure to have a great RESUME to land that interview! Check out this video to make a Data Analyst Resume —> https://youtu.be/Ns-8Jsa3mEM
fweZQqB0nwQ,Why is this video so quiet?
fweZQqB0nwQ,Hey Alex! Nice vídeo. One feedback: audios is quite low to listen mobile.
fweZQqB0nwQ,"I have a bit of a dilemma. I get advice to not show age but only including the past 10 years of work experience. The thing is, I want to move back to health care analytics and I had solid experience in revenue cycle, a variety of cerner products, medical records, HL7, HMO,  plus a nursing degree.  That experience was 15 to 20 years ago though.  My current experience is government software testing,  but nothing to do with healthcare."
fweZQqB0nwQ,i can barely hear anything
fweZQqB0nwQ,Is it just me or is the volume like super low? All his other videos sound fine but I cannot hear what he is saying at all in the video.
fweZQqB0nwQ,Okay what about answers
fweZQqB0nwQ,The recording is so poor. I can hardly hear anything you are saying
fweZQqB0nwQ,I’m here cause I have my first data analyst role interview in a few days. I hope I get the position
fweZQqB0nwQ,Audio Is low !
fweZQqB0nwQ,Also what if you don't have experience with some of the tools preferred in the JD? How do you answer?
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Hi Alex, today I got my job offer for the data analyst role. I am thrilled. Thank you for all the help. I followed your channel religiously and your interview tips really helped me to ace the interview. The best advice you gave was to start doing projects instead of taking class after class because I was one of those people who was focused more on taking class than to practice my skills. After watching that video of yours I started working on my projects instead. I am really grateful to you. Thank you for being part of my journey and for guiding so many people like me. I look forward to learning more from your channel."
fweZQqB0nwQ,Audio is really low
fweZQqB0nwQ,"For questions about culture, does it hurt to ask questions about specific aspects of the culture?  I recently asked what a company does to support the health and well-being of its employees and to prevent burnout.  I worry that questions like that can make it seem like I'm not willing to put in effort when needed, but at the same time I don't want to jump into a meat grinder."
fweZQqB0nwQ,@Alex you are a Genius
fweZQqB0nwQ,Do you think these questions stay the same even if you’re interviewing internally? Or would they be different
fweZQqB0nwQ,nice one alex.
fweZQqB0nwQ,"So my current status is I went to college for Stats degree (learned statistics, some analysis, R, and Java) but still feel a bit underprepared. I want to become a data analyst as soon as possible. The problem is the interview. I studied certain questions but I wanna know how to get to a point where I always know what the interviewer is talking about and can give a decent answer. I'll keep studying SAS and SQL but I hear there are a lot of aspects of a data analysis project I am unfamiliar with, so what is the best route I can take to get me to a point where I almost always know what they are talking about?"
fweZQqB0nwQ,Audio is too low
fweZQqB0nwQ,I am a dentist and want to switch to data analytics. I am looking for a online course which is credible. How do I start this journey. Can you guide me?
fweZQqB0nwQ,This video is low and I can’t hear anything
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Alex , would you mind to make a video about how to write a prober report  for example after making a good dashboard on Power BI or tableau , how can i make a good report ? What is the points i should cover ? Thanks in advance"
fweZQqB0nwQ,if i get rejected in the technical interview can I try again in the future when i have improved my skills?
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Appreciate your effort, but not happy with the content in this particular video. These are just behavioural questions. Real time, like tell me about your last project,"
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Great work Alex. Thank you so much for these questions. I also think some of the questions may change on the basis of region like people in US definitely would be asking some where different questions compared to people in India.
One of the recruiter asked me questions on various use cases.
Also I have been rejected with some lame excuse too even though my answers were correct. 
Also I felt your voice is low in this video"
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Hii Alex, Its very useful, Please make a video on python too"
fweZQqB0nwQ,definitely gonna watch this before interview
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Alex, this is excellent information. Would you  interview a person for a  junior data analyst position the same way you would for a senior data analyst position? If not I’d appreciate questions you would ask a prospective jr analyst. 😎"
fweZQqB0nwQ,Can you make a video for Entry level jobs Interview Questions in Data Analytics?
fweZQqB0nwQ,I am in general a perfectionist. It’s definitely my drawback. Why am i not supposed to say this? Pls let me know
fweZQqB0nwQ,What if someone starting new doesn't have much domain knowledge. How to handle such questions then?
fweZQqB0nwQ,Why can't we just be honest?
fweZQqB0nwQ,Behavorial questions
fweZQqB0nwQ,Thanks for the questions! I’ll definitely prepare myself with them
fweZQqB0nwQ,I'm so happy that I found your channel. It really helped me to gain essential information about Data analysis market. Thanks 💟
fweZQqB0nwQ,can you please make python interview questions vedio?
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Hey Alex, your content is so informative.
Btw, I’m an admin assistant working in Saudi Arabia dealing with dashboards and reports every single day.
I’m planning to do a career change to data analytics.
I was a Bachelor of Science in Applied Statistics graduate and got a reasonable knowledge in SPSS and MS Excel for dashboards.
I have also a little bit of knowledge about Python.
Your advice with my career change plan will be highly appreciated.
I’m your new subscriber.
😊"
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Hey, I just finished my sophomore year in college. I love watching your videos and will definitely use your advice when I apply to data analyst intern roles next year."
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Hi Alex,
First of all, thanks for your content. Your videos are very informative and helpful for my research to becoming a data analyst. I am currently an accountant and have recently started looking at becoming an analyst. I did not have a computer science or statistics, or programming background but I know my excel and small amounts of SQL and your videos have encouraged me to start the transition. 


I'm currently using Khan Academy for basic SQL, Stat, and looking at Coursera or Udemy for SQL and Python. I am also considering starting my road to get a certificate in Big Data from my local respected community college in my area. I was wondering if you could put out a video about which resources you used when you were self-teaching yourself some of the technical skills. I've also found that not a ton of jobs respect many of these boot camps that are popping up left and right, any opinion on that? Because bootcamps are over promising obviously to learning many items in just 12 weeks.

Again, thanks for the great honest and informative content and you're very encouraging on the career path switch.
-AD"
fweZQqB0nwQ,I saw your post on reddit. Very informative and to the point. I'm looking forward to the next video. Thanks.
fweZQqB0nwQ,"Thanks again Dr alex, please make a video about what we need to know about statistics .
my greetings"
fweZQqB0nwQ,Can u do a video on technical questions (SQL questions) asked in the interview?
fweZQqB0nwQ,Looking forward to this series
oXAwKZWfbW0,"What I didn't show you: Watching Moana 3 times per day...


Everyone stay safe and healthy at home! Thanks for watching!"
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Alex, thank you for this video and for showing the realistic life of a data analyst. You're the best!"
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Alex! Can we get a updated day in life, great content!"
oXAwKZWfbW0,How many hours do u work a day generally?
oXAwKZWfbW0,Looks like beans from even Steven's taking the snack from the table edge 😅
oXAwKZWfbW0,Alex With nail paints on 😂
oXAwKZWfbW0,If you don’t mind me asking what is pay for your type of work? What’s your job title? Is google Certs any good that you recommend?
oXAwKZWfbW0,I LOVE the Lex Fridman podcast @5:11
oXAwKZWfbW0,Interesting. You don't get much sleep then.
oXAwKZWfbW0,Hey Alex! I wanna clarify a doubt with u. Could u let me know which course to pick in college for data science and should I go for BSc or MSC integrated.
oXAwKZWfbW0,"haha, that outfit in the meeting"
oXAwKZWfbW0,"OMG You listen to Lex's Podcast and are also a degenerate on 9GAG! 

Now I'm starting to know why I like your vibe that much haha."
oXAwKZWfbW0,LOL Even working to 1:30am I'm finding the work-life balance hard to believe. LOL
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Alex, In this video I see that you're using Databricks. What would a analyst use that tool for and if you're a entry-level analyst looking to work for a company that uses Azure, would that be something to learn at the start. Your videos are wonderful and insightful!"
oXAwKZWfbW0,Do you ever get tired of your work and feel like you're almost doing the same thing day in day out?
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Good day Alex,
I am looking to dive into university and follow through with a career as a data analyst. May I know what laptops would be benefit me in the long term. Don't mind me asking but what laptops are you using on a daily basis for work?"
oXAwKZWfbW0,Random Q: Do you think looking at screens and sitting for so many hours a day causes any physical issues?
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Hi, i have questions. Plz could you please tell me 
How much math do data analytics use per day.
I am doing data science with python, but not sure about this field bcz i feel scary when i see mathematics."
oXAwKZWfbW0,Wow you're a trooper. What an interesting schedule haha
oXAwKZWfbW0,What laptop did you get issued?
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Hey Alex, thanks for showing us what a data analyst does during the quarantine. Your content is great! (Your cute kids are a bonus). I'm hoping to become a data analyst after college and am doing a data analyst internship now and your videos help me a lot. 

Kudos to you for placing family as a priority without compromising work quality (through the late nights). All the best to you for balancing work and family!"
oXAwKZWfbW0,baby is adorable. but you letting him paint your toenails explains EVERYTHIGN ABOUT you
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Alex you are providing good content, because I do find that ultimately whatever career people choose they want to see a day in the life of that career and see if they are a good fit. So Kudos to you on your success and happiness"
oXAwKZWfbW0,Thanks for sharing in r/sql. Props to you and your wife for making it work! Great video. I'm an Operations Specialist in Seattle looking to make the jump to Data Analyst sometime in the future so looking forward to picking up some pointers from your videos. Take care! 👋
oXAwKZWfbW0,I'm looking to transition from a desktop support role to data analyst. I'll be taking some data science courses at Collin College. Can you suggest what to put on a resume for those who have taken data science courses but no actual work experience?
oXAwKZWfbW0,"Ur kids r cute  , What's their name's? 😍😅"
bhnrIforc7s,"wow siêu đỉnh, siêu dễ hiểu luôn ạ!
wow you're such an amazing teacher, the video is extremely easy to understand. thank you so much.
sending respect from Vietnam hihi"
bhnrIforc7s,Toby again😂
bhnrIforc7s,THANKS FOR THE EXPLANATORY VIDEOS. PLEASE HOW DO I DELETE ONE OUT OF TWO DUPLICATED ROWS IN A TABLE
bhnrIforc7s,Random employee ID 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bhnrIforc7s,"Hi Alex,

Thank you for these fantastic videos! I’m learning a lot. Great job! Just one thing:

If I want to update several rows at the same time,  I mean, imagine all Employee IDs are set to 1012, and you want to update each employee to their correct Employee ID (e.g., 1001, 1002, 1003, etc.). how would I do that?"
bhnrIforc7s,LOL deleting Toby was not random at all!
bhnrIforc7s,"if for example i insert something twice with same info , how can i delete only one of them , and can we delete or update more than one column at once"
bhnrIforc7s,"""I appreciate your proactive approach to problem-solving. Your initiative has saved us time and effort."""
bhnrIforc7s,👌👌👌
bhnrIforc7s,"If you want to hire Toby back (which I don't recommend) just execute this:

INSERT INTO SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics VALUES
(1005, 'Toby', 'Flanderson', 32, 'Male')"
bhnrIforc7s,How to add a new column (with data obtained from sql select statements) in existing table?
bhnrIforc7s,mr alex my ssms is not working and i have been using the server link but its stil not working
bhnrIforc7s,"1. BEGIN TRAN is your friend...
2. If deleting any data out of a table, any related records in other tables will need to be deleted as well."
bhnrIforc7s,BEGIN TRAN is your friend...
bhnrIforc7s,How to delete a primary key column??🙄

bhnrIforc7s,How can one delete duplicate rows with similar info without deleting both
bhnrIforc7s,BUT WHY DO YOU HATE tOBY SO MUCH? :C WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU
bhnrIforc7s,"i have a question how do i change the column name? Example in my table its EmployeeID but i wanna change the column to Employee_ID

Edit: Never mind i watched lear sql i used EXEC sp_rename '#Temp_Employee.EmployeeID', 'Employee_ID'
is this the best method to rename it? also i got a message Caution: Changing any part of an object name could break scripts and stored procedure. and it kinda spooked me"
bhnrIforc7s,"hey Alix can you please guide me how to delete duplicate rows(As I execute the table 2 times so all the entries are repeated)
Thanks]"
bhnrIforc7s,how to update multiple rows at once?
bhnrIforc7s,Mehn.... Thank you for making all this so easy
bhnrIforc7s,Very helpful tips about the delete statement! Thanks Alex.
bhnrIforc7s,"Hey guys, Maybe anyone can help me, We deleted row number 1005, how you put it back?

thank you so much for the tutorial in advance mate!!! Very accurate"
bhnrIforc7s,"Wonderful job you are doing Alex, thank you.
Please i like to ask, how will the Aliasing Function be updated on my database so that i can subsequently write my queries with these aliases?"
bhnrIforc7s,deleting toby... nice ;D
bhnrIforc7s,Thank you Alex for the valuable key before deleting any information!
bhnrIforc7s,HR had it coming since the low salary increase.
bhnrIforc7s,Love how you deleted Toby LOL

bhnrIforc7s,"Goodbye, Toby!"
bhnrIforc7s,"Thanks , Alex You are a  amazing good teacher 👌👌🥇🥇💡💡"
bhnrIforc7s,Completely random row ID. Picks Toby XD
bhnrIforc7s,"As I am following from the previous video(Having Clause), When I run the code, I can just see below..... I cannot see after 1009. Am I the only one that is having this problem? Also, even if I use (FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographic, I can see 1009 max) Orr This is just a different table format?
(SELECT *

FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.employeeSalary)
1001	Salesman	45000
1002	Receptionist	36000

bhnrIforc7s,How do i delete duplicate rows? if the WHERE clause will always choose all of the observations/rows?
bhnrIforc7s,Alex thank you so much. You’ve been of great help.
bhnrIforc7s,Who else saw it coming Toby would be the one to get deleted? 😂 thank you so much for these videos BTW! they're super easy to follow.
bhnrIforc7s,"""I'm going to just pick a random ID"".... proceeds to delete Toby lol. Michael would be proud!"
bhnrIforc7s,thanks
bhnrIforc7s,"Another good trick to safeguard Delete Statement, is to run it in a Transaction, so if stuff go wrong, you jusy roll back, otherwise, commit 😊"
bhnrIforc7s,once again...... Poor Toby :(
bhnrIforc7s,Begin transaction and rollback statements helps you to undo your deleted row /truncated/dropped table .
bhnrIforc7s,completely random employee number to delete... 🤣🤣🤣 So many good Office jokes. I love it!
bhnrIforc7s,"That Deleted Row wasn't random at all, nobody likes Toby!"
bhnrIforc7s,Is there a trick for deleting duplicates?
bhnrIforc7s,This wasn't a random ID this was by design XD
bhnrIforc7s,WHERE'S KELLY  😆
bhnrIforc7s,Chooses an ID at random to delete....oh it's Toby
bhnrIforc7s,Thank you Alex
bhnrIforc7s,CAN you add how can  we delete if there is duplicate data
bhnrIforc7s,"When does the deletion actually happen? Does it run like a Select and return a table and then delete that, or at least what that's pointing to? Do we ever need to worry that during a complicated delete the data we're comparing to in that statement gets deleted during the process and we end up trying to access something that no longer exists? It's not always clear to me what's going on just behind the scenes."
bhnrIforc7s,"Deleting Toby's record wasn't ""Completely Random"" at all"

bhnrIforc7s,Shade on Toby on those is incredible😂. I am amazed that it doesn't get enough appreciation
bhnrIforc7s,"Thank you so much Alex, no matter how lazy i am, the length of your videos gives me the courage to learn at least one new thing a day"
bhnrIforc7s,what if you want to update multiple rows in this case add gender column and want add male and female to employers
bhnrIforc7s,Very Insightful
bhnrIforc7s,Day 2 of the bootcamp for me. Learning a lot!
bhnrIforc7s,"Thank you so much Alex for the wonderful work, you made the lessons so easy and very educative.

A very nice trick on the DELETE using the SELECT statement. please can you explain how to use the DELETE statement when you have duplicated rows? The SELECT statement trick actually saved me from messing up my data!

Thank you once again for the great job you're doing."
bhnrIforc7s,Done
bhnrIforc7s,"Thank you free SQL training videos I am watching them all one by one. Very informative and easy to understand but I didn't subscribe to your channel yet, do I need to?"

bhnrIforc7s,Thank you Sir
bhnrIforc7s,"Thank you, Alex. Short, easy and clear.
I wish there was a way to refer to a record apart from the content of the fields (like a unique key) though. One use case I can think of is where the unique key is missing and you need to update or delete the record.
I will keep learning."
bhnrIforc7s,"With delete, will we get more information on how to delete duplicated rows? TIA!"
bhnrIforc7s,"deletes ""Completely Random employeeid""

bhnrIforc7s,"Hi Alex, thank you for your videos. they are very informative ,short and right on point. I completed SQL tutorial series. feeling much confident now . waiting for python series from basics"
bhnrIforc7s,"Hi, Alex! THANK YOU for your time, I really enjoy your lessons, but I've reached an impasse. I don't understand why the ""UPDATE"" data doesn't work for me.

P.S.: I don't know if this really matters, but I noticed that in your top left corner you have ""SQL Tutorial"" and I've got ""SQL Learning"" and when I have to write FROM what table I select or what table I want to UPDATE, I don't have to write all the ""SQLTutorial.dbo...."""
bhnrIforc7s,How often do you need to update and delete data as a data analyst compared to querying data with select statements?
bhnrIforc7s,Sooo were going to just delete a employee at random… TOBY FLENDERSON. 😂
bhnrIforc7s,"Every time you execute,is it automatically saving your progress? What if I mess up trying something and it didn't go according to plan?"
bhnrIforc7s,"Hi Alex, really loved the idea of safeguarding through Select statement"
bhnrIforc7s,good tip to SELECT before DELETE
bhnrIforc7s,"Hello Alex.Why did you use two criteriums in 1:26?XD Where can i find good and simple tutorial about using github in a way you explain this?XD are you gonna make tutorials about python like you did for sql, tableau and excel? Please."
bhnrIforc7s,this is good stuff bro!
bhnrIforc7s,"3:13 ""Let's delete a completely random employee"" Come on Alex! Everyone knew it was Toby haha!"
bhnrIforc7s,Completely randomly Toby got deleted. Everybody hates him.

bhnrIforc7s,Awesome video
bhnrIforc7s,Employee ID 1005... we were all rooting for that to happen 😌😂

tYBOMw7Ob8E,Thank you sir! :)
tYBOMw7Ob8E,data for populating the tables?
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Good example.
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Thanks fooo
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"@AlexTheAnalyst When i am running the same query at 3:09 I m getting HR too along with other two shown in video with avg(salary) $50000....m I missing something or you updated DB before creating the video...btw great videos I really like the series. I am doing SQL course from your videos. Its great content for revision, explaining just the core things.
HR	                                50000
Salesman	                52000
Regional Manager	65000"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Wow a YouTube video that just gives you the information you need to the point. What is this 2005?? Thanks!!
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"From Chat GPT: 
WHERE Clause
Purpose:

The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before any groupings are made. It filters records based on specified conditions.
Usage: Applied to individual rows in a table.
It cannot be used with aggregate functions (like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc.).
When to Use: Use the WHERE clause to filter records before aggregation or grouping.

Example:
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;

HAVING Clause
Purpose: The HAVING clause is used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause has been applied. It filters records based on aggregate conditions.
Usage: Applied to groups of rows created by the GROUP BY clause.
Can be used with aggregate functions.
When to Use: Use the HAVING clause to filter aggregated data or groups of data.

Example:
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

Key Differences
Order of Execution:
WHERE: Filters rows before grouping and aggregation.
HAVING: Filters groups after grouping and aggregation.
Scope:
WHERE: Filters individual rows.
HAVING: Filters aggregated data (groups of rows).
Aggregate Functions:
WHERE: Cannot be used with aggregate functions.
HAVING: Can be used with aggregate functions.

Combined Use of WHERE and HAVING
In a single query, both WHERE and HAVING clauses can be used together to filter data at different stages of the query:
Filter rows before aggregation with WHERE.
Filter groups after aggregation with HAVING.

Example:
SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE JobTitle = 'Engineer'
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 70000;"

tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Thank you so much, so clear!"

tYBOMw7Ob8E,"This is a great series, and the examples go over why some SQL does and does not work which is very helpful."
tYBOMw7Ob8E,I'm curious; why wasn't 'HR' included in the average salary output at 3:11?
tYBOMw7Ob8E,THANK YOU😊
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Not sure what happened to the HR job titles in your last example.  Mine returned HR with and AVG salary of $50,000"

tYBOMw7Ob8E,It’s almost like you don’t like Toby as much as Micheal
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Commenting for traction as I continue learning, thanks as always for the videos!"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Hi Alex,
Thanks for the great explaination.
When I run this :
select 
	jobTitle,
	avg(Salary) as avg_salary
from 
	EmployeeSalary 
group by 1
having avg(Salary) > 42000;
I get error ""Each GROUP BY expression must contain at least one column that is not an outer reference.""

But this works fine
select 
	jobTitle,
	avg(Salary) as avg_salary
from 
	EmployeeSalary 
group by JobTitle
having avg(Salary) > 42000;

Do you know why ""group by 1"" doesnt work here."
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Thank you Alex!
tYBOMw7Ob8E,realy amasing i love it
tYBOMw7Ob8E,why should the having clause come above the order by claus in the average salary case
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Alex, you're the real deal. Much love. Posterity willl definitely remember you"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"very well explained the topic as I have gone through several videos of SQL queries however this video has explained everything in depth ,appreciated #Alex The Analyst for your efforts, thanks for these videos"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,I’m getting HR as well with 50K average salary with the last query. Anybody else?
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"1) Thanks! 
2) Who wrote GROUP BY function & why is it ALWAYS such a PITA?

tYBOMw7Ob8E,Thank you Alex!
tYBOMw7Ob8E,brilliant sir
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"I just have a question, can't we do HAVING count(JobTitle)  even though we group by salary, isnt that possible? thank you"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Yo! What did Michael do to Toby in this video?
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Helpful and really good explanation
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Can someone explain to me why

FROM EmployeeDemographics
JOIN EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
GROUP BY JobTitle
HAVING avgsalary > 45000
ORDER BY avgsalary


is not working and I have to change the HAVING avgsalary > 45000 to  HAVING AVG(Salary) > 45000?
I just wanted to try other methods if I could use HAVING clause with the column names and not the (Argument)"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Great job! Thanks
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"So the Having has to come immediately after the Group by, but where comes before group by"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Here again. Keep Learning
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Done
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Such a good teacher. Thanks.
tYBOMw7Ob8E,I have bee trying to understand the having statement and I can say that these short series videos do not overwhelm at all. And yes! I now get the having clause.
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Thanks Alex, Awesome Video!"

tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Thank you so much Alex, clear and simple explanations!"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Beautiful
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Noticed that I got HR added in at the end there and it's not exactly like your solution.

I have the syntax exactly like yours too.

	ON [EmployeeDemographics].[EmployeeID] = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
GROUP BY JobTitle
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 45000

tYBOMw7Ob8E,thank you Alex for the great tutorials. in this video i couldn't understand the difference between WHERE and HAVING
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Do you think your tutorials are enough to get an entry level job? I just applied at 7 places (2 local, 5 remote) this week, but wondering if maybe I'm in over my head not knowing enough? I'm trying to just use SQL + Tableau to get an entry level job around $70k."
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Thanks for the Videos Alex! Really clear and simple explanations! For everyone following along, I think he deleted HR entry from the EmployeeDemographics table. It be really funny if he pops up in the videos moving forward."
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Simple and clear explanation.... thanks
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Hello Alex thankyou so much for the great series i've finished basics and came here and i'm going straight forward to the advanced one i really appreciate your great effort
and i got a question please: is it possible to have an AVG for a specific amount of values for ex i got 4 different jobs with 4 different salaries is it possible to calculate the avg of just 2"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,3:10 wtf
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Recently I'm learning SQL and these videos are really helpful. Thank you Alex!
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Thanks Alex!
tYBOMw7Ob8E,what's the difference between having and where
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Excellent videos, subscribed!"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Or how my college instructor would say ""WHERE can't math"" to explain using HAVING for Aggregate functions"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,Truly enjoyed this series thus far! Thanks so much Alex!
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"I would have thought the Having Clause would still be considered beginner level. When you start combining sub-queries with joins along with case statements in the same query, then I'd be comfortable saying I'm at a solid intermediate level. I would not know where to begin to be considered advanced!"
tYBOMw7Ob8E,"Good explanation, subscribed!"

Twusw__OzA8,spill the tea on the HR team brother
Twusw__OzA8,I see your love for HR!!!!
Twusw__OzA8,"Poor Toby! 😂  Great video, Thanks!!"
Twusw__OzA8,Truth must be told... Just started my career path in Data Analytics and following your boot camp till now has been easily educative.. Thank you😊
Twusw__OzA8,"I loved your class, especially the table :)"
Twusw__OzA8,How would you display the new salary value to 2 decimal places?
Twusw__OzA8,"Would you be able to round the 'SalaryAfterRaise' Column? If so, how would you write that query?"
Twusw__OzA8,Jim is older than Dwight??
Twusw__OzA8,"Alex, you’re THE MAN!!"
Twusw__OzA8,I feel personally attacked because I'm 31 and work in HR
Twusw__OzA8,"Well, Initially I used to take SQL as another house chore, which means skipping it. But not anymore, Thanks Alex for bringing 'The Office' staff here for our smooth learning. Also, Toby Flenderson - Fired."
Twusw__OzA8,toby doesn't deserve a raise :D that got me
Twusw__OzA8,"@AlexTheAnalyst I don't know what I did wrong, I followed your instructions on the last case statement but my results was Arithmetic Overflow Error Converting Varchar To Data Type Numeric. I'm using MSSQl too. I don't know what I missed, Please help me. Thank you"
Twusw__OzA8,5:55 HR ☠☠☠
Twusw__OzA8,So the case statement is under the select statement?
Twusw__OzA8,5 cents for HR🤣🤣🤣Seems generous. What an amazing way to teach complex topics.
Twusw__OzA8,5:50 that felt personal...
Twusw__OzA8,you are even worse then michael. give toby some more raise 🤣
Twusw__OzA8,"Why you got to do my boy toby like that , i know everyone hates the HR, but that's just cruel :(
Great video btw!"
Twusw__OzA8,best series ever for the data analaytic beginner
Twusw__OzA8,"love your contents
keep bringing video on analytics skills"
Twusw__OzA8,"Would this BootCamp be enough to obtain an Entry level data analyst job (No Experience, NoTechDegree) ?"
Twusw__OzA8,Must have a grudge on that HR!
Twusw__OzA8,"Im not a baby, but stilll good tutorial haha"
Twusw__OzA8,30 is NOT OLD…. 😂😂😂
Twusw__OzA8,"whenever I put the case statement in, it gives me an error saying that the column names are invalid but without the case statement, the query runs perfectly. has anyone else encountered this?"
Twusw__OzA8,"May I ask, I have a dataset that I am using for my portfolio project and I was given country names  and I used the CASE function to analyze the data by continents, I then created a TEMP table so that I can include the continents in a column and be able to use them, but after doing that I cannot use the SUM function of my TEMP table as I want to SUM some values on the TEMP table and GROUP them by continent, why is that? Everything on the TEMP table checks out just fine."
Twusw__OzA8,"I do not know why but after I put in the values on Salary raises. It says 

Salary' is not a recognized built-in function name."

lYKkro6rKm0,hello alex thanks to ur data analyst boot camp it have helped me so well in my DA journey i used it not just as a starting point into my DA journey but also as a guide as to the important things i need to learn even when i watch other tutorials u did so well on how u explain things and make it easier for anyone to understand. thank u for what u do may God bless u
lYKkro6rKm0,Amazing work! Can't believe I am actually enjoying learning this
lYKkro6rKm0,may i ask what a practical use of the union would be in cases where tables don't have the same column structures / input as in the example on this lecture.
lYKkro6rKm0,PLEASE EXPALIN THE CONTENTS OF WAREHOUSEEMPLYEEDEMOGRAPHICS AND HOW AND WHY YOU MADE IT YOU DIDNT EXPLAIN THAT IN THE PREVIOUS VIDEO AT ALL . THANKY YOU
lYKkro6rKm0,you really need to edit sound of your videos. im so annoyed of your basses and sizzles
lYKkro6rKm0,hi u did not show creating warehouse table and inserting rows.. so what data should we insert ?
lYKkro6rKm0,"Hiiii, first of all thank you so kuch for all the information. I created the 3rd table and it apperas under sqltutorial but when i try to insert the code after From sqltutorial.dbo.(tablename), it doesnt show the table and giving me error. What should i do to avoid this."
lYKkro6rKm0,where the fuck the ware house data base came from ?

Your videos are very easy to understand and so much engaging. Hope to be able to finish this all in just a few months and then I will take the certification with Google to complete my adventure to being a Data Analyst. Keep up the great work and videos and here's to hoping you will post more as the trend nowadays about technology are fast. Thank you!"

lYKkro6rKm0,I certainly love the way you are presenting SQL. I do not remember creating data warehousing in the beginning. Did I miss something? LOL
lYKkro6rKm0,Awesome. I am growing bit by bit
lYKkro6rKm0,Thank you
lYKkro6rKm0,"Hi Alex, in video 8 how did you come up with the warehouse employee demographics table. Thanks"
lYKkro6rKm0,"I also learned that when using UNION and UNION ALL, There has to be an exact pairing of the columns for each table.

It will produce an error if you try to use UNION and SELECT different columns for each table."
lYKkro6rKm0,"So, I experimented with what would happen even if the number of tables is the same but the column name is different. It doesn't work when the value types are different. lol"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Had to watch this like 3 times 😅 but yeah! Join = merge columns, Union = merge Rows"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Thanks Alex, this is indeed great. 
You made join so easy to understand, gracias man!"
lYKkro6rKm0,Still making progress.
lYKkro6rKm0,Done
lYKkro6rKm0,"Awesome vide. Why in your join the employee ID column is duplicated ? I mean in the beginning of the video, after you joined them , you should only see one column for employee ID, thats the purpose of join to create one table. Is this presentation unique to SQL server? because i dont have this with MySQL. Thanks"
lYKkro6rKm0,"(You have to use the SQLTutorial Database)

If i am attempting to clean data that I unioned and I want to keep for data visualiziation later, how do I save that union as a new table ? TIA :)"
lYKkro6rKm0,The WarehouseEmployeeDemographic came from?
lYKkro6rKm0,3:36 But how do you identify based on the result of the query which employees belong to warehouse employee table and which employees belong to employeedemographics table? Assuming you have hundreds of data in the real scenario? In excel it is easy to identify.🤔🤔
lYKkro6rKm0,When I tried the UNION (not UNION All) Darryl showed up twice for me. Does anyone know what might have caused this?
lYKkro6rKm0,Hello Alex thanks for the WareHouseEmployeeDemographics. How did you set that up. Thanks
lYKkro6rKm0,Hey @Alex The Analyst. Very good tutorials. Any idea when you would able to upload some more intermediate and advanced tutorials for SQL. Thanks buddy! 👊🏾
lYKkro6rKm0,Thank you Sir
lYKkro6rKm0,"Good stuff as always, Alex!  Do you have a rule of thumb to avoid UNIONS if you can get the result you need with JOINS?  I've always considered connecting data based on a clear relationship / keys in the data as the best way to go. In any case, cheers and thanks!"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Hi! Thanks for the videos!

When I create new tables, then when writing, the system does not suggest them like it does with previous tables, what what could be happening? (The query works well anyway..)"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Msg 205, Level 16, State 1, Line 5
All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists."
lYKkro6rKm0,"So wouldn't you just use unions and where the columns contain the same data joiner (say employee id) make that the filtering attribute?

It seems to me that unions are far more flexible but you still be careful to qualify it otherwise a union will just jam disparate data elements together

Physician, know thy data 😀"
lYKkro6rKm0,"So ultimately, unions do not need a common table to combine the data?"
lYKkro6rKm0,"THANKS, ALEX!"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Hey Alex, i just wanted to say thank you so much!!
Your way of explaining concepts is actually amazing."
lYKkro6rKm0,You are really not boring. I could watch your tutorials for hours without resting LOL. Keep up the good work Alex.
lYKkro6rKm0,"2:22 You might think like ""Where that the 1st row came from?""

Explanation: At 2:01, you do not see the all rows from the first query; only 10 rows of that are shown."
lYKkro6rKm0,"tldr: join = concat columns, union = concat rows"
lYKkro6rKm0,Thanks!
lYKkro6rKm0,Thanks.
lYKkro6rKm0,can you make a video on semi joins and anti joins please?
lYKkro6rKm0,"Hi Alex, Just stopping by making a break from watching your videos in a row, to say thank you not only for the great and prompt explanatory videos but also keeping the  eagerness on learning more about SQL and waiting for every next video to learn more. Having left SQL memories back to my IT college years because of following slightly different direction , but now after many years that i decided to refresh my knowledge i feel like i've been taught SQL so smoothly! We are definetely lucky to have inspiring people like you!"

lYKkro6rKm0,"hi Alex i love your content it's very helpful for me to spawn my SQL technique, just wonder if I have two columns n each column nothing's similar and  don't have an equal number of expression. what's code should I use? i tried to use union it didn't work same as join either. thanks in advance"
lYKkro6rKm0,"This is very similar to a concat/append when working with python pandas data frames. 
Very cool"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Loving this great series. Is there an advanced series?

Only seen the beginner and intermediate.
I am however very grateful for these Alex"
lYKkro6rKm0,"Hi Alex 🙋‍♀️ Thanks for making these good videos. I want to add - the order of datatype in selected columns should be same. Like in our case: int, varchar, int for both select queries. If this is not same in both (or more) select queries, then union fails."

9URM1_2S0ho,"Great video, Alex!  Super helpful in my data analyst learning.

Quick heads-up: in the example where we calculate the average salary of Salesmen, the INNER JOIN you use:

SELECT JobTitle, AVG(Salary)  
FROM EmployeeDemographics  
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary  
  ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID  
WHERE JobTitle = 'Salesman'  
GROUP BY JobTitle

gives 52000 but excludes this row due to a NULL ID:

(NULL, 'Salesman', 43000)

The accurate avg is 49750, which we get if we query EmployeeSalary directly. Just wanted to share for clarity — still loving the series! 🙏"

First of all, thank you for these tutorials. They're very helpful.
For the second use case, I suggest you may use FULL OUTER JOIN instead of INNER JOIN because there's a data from the table EmployeeSalary which is missing in your results (a salesman who has a salary = 43000).
Thank you."
9URM1_2S0ho,"Hi Alex, thank you for this bootcamp. I'm an accountant transitioning into Data Analytics and i can say your bootcamp has simplified each step for me.

9URM1_2S0ho,I was learning very well until you came up the tables that have 'NULL' in them without explanation of how you got there. If you explained that part the intermediate level would have been REALLY easy.

9URM1_2S0ho,"I think over the years things have changed a bit, FULL OUTER JOIN is just not working and keep getting errors.

9URM1_2S0ho,poor dwight
9URM1_2S0ho,"SOME TROUBLESHOOTING INFO, maybe for someone it will be helpful.  Hi Alex! Thank you very much for the courses. The beginners course is great. When I moved on to intermediate I understood that Im stucked a bit. In MySQL for instance FULL OUTER JOIN doesn't work, only  LEFT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Then I got that in this course you use SQL Server Management Studio. For such beginners as me It could be nice to get the information in the beginning, that you use a slightly different version. I managed to install the SQL Server MS. But sadly I can't download the database Parks_and_Recreation into the SQL Server MS. it shows different errors, so there is no posibility to try all commands you use in your video. Maybe you read this comment to help others. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING! YOU ARE A GREAT MAN!!!"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Thank you! I am not an English speaker and I studied SQL during university, but I understood everything until now from you! Thank you Alex for this effort and for providing this content  for free! I hope to use what I am learning in this Bootcamp in my career as a Data Analyst inshallah. And I loved how you gave Dwight a higher salary than The boss Michael. He would be happy if he knew that🤣 شكرًا أليكس"
9URM1_2S0ho,hi sorry for a dumb question but have you made this database available? I remember on the beginners' course being able to use the Parks and Rec db just great. Thanks!

9URM1_2S0ho,"I learned joins from the Google DA course through Coursera.  This video is FAR better explaining it.  However, Google's course touched on joins using different fields if you wanted to join 2 tables.  Example:  Lego Dataset, Star Wars builder sets table and parts table.  Neither had the same column for an easy join like your employee demographics and employee salary example.  Can you make a video explaining how to join tables with SIMILAR fields but not the same field?  Thank you for all the videos you have put out!!"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Understanding Joins in SQL has really been a challenge for me and I can say with this video, Its a solution. So exemplifying. Thanks Alex."
9URM1_2S0ho,"good content, too bad the example are toward cutting the pay of an employee"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Hey Alex, I would like to know how create these tables with null values so that I can query them myself and understand better."
9URM1_2S0ho,"Thanks for your tutorial Alex, but i have a question under Full outer join 4:15 when i tried mine it gave me an Error code: 1064, it highlight the outer in red colour, even after updating the tables values you dropped in the comment sections, i still get this error msg, but the other joins are working. I use MySQL Workbench on MacOS."
9URM1_2S0ho,Thanks for ur clearcut explanation
9URM1_2S0ho,"hi im getting an error message here! can someone help me please and thank you!

this is what i inputted
SELECT*
FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
Inner Join SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID

and this is the error message:

Msg 208, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
Invalid object name 'SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics'."
9URM1_2S0ho,"@ https://youtu.be/9URM1_2S0ho?t=521 (That time loop), my pc cannot execute that command, yet I have followed the procedure.😥😥"
9URM1_2S0ho,"is there any community or forum or even reddit of the people that all learn together the data analyst playlist that u put out? i have some questions regarding and would be nice to have someone to discuss together with, im really stuck here alone :("
9URM1_2S0ho,01.26.24 done
9URM1_2S0ho,"Thank you for this Alex! I had one question though.

Doesn't LEFT OUTER JOIN simply show the complete left table? Since the overlapping elements are already in the table, isn't it easier to say that the Left Join displays all the first table's contents?
If that's not the case, then can I get an example for the same?"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Great video, as a beginner it was actually easy to understand the concept behind each join"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Can someone help me, I don't understand why I'm getting 153 rows under table EmployeeSalary. My data seems to be duplicated"
9URM1_2S0ho,"How do you highlight, cut, paste so quickly? It looks like you're just clicking through your demos. It would be helpful to work more efficiently, ""smarter not harder"". Thank you for all your amazing, very accessible, and comprehensive work!"
9URM1_2S0ho,for the last part of the video i think we dont need inner join since we already have all the column we need (salary and job title) on employeeSalary table CMIIW
9URM1_2S0ho,"6:40 the left and right joins are only for datas which has null In it correct? if not, then when can we use it

because we have the row emplyeeID for both, if the employeeID for the first table doesnt match the employeeID in the next table, we put that as NULL please correct me if i am wrong"
9URM1_2S0ho,"I tried many ways to understand the joins in a comprehensive way, but Alex was the only one that was properly explain it.
Thanks Alex!!"
9URM1_2S0ho,any resources where we can start practicing the sql question??
9URM1_2S0ho,Love the way you use office characters
9URM1_2S0ho,"Alex the data ANALYST ""HERO"""
9URM1_2S0ho,Would someone be able to help me? My rows keep increasing each time I execute a join with Alex. So I end up having more rows in my output than his. What can I do?
9URM1_2S0ho,"I'm not sure but for the last exemple you show for the AVG Salary, you don't actually need to make a JOIN at all, isn't it?"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Thank you so much for giving us this! We are eternally grateful for all you do.  However, I have followed and replicated what you did from playlist 1 to 7 but when I got to the Full Outer Join, my query returned only 9 results as against 14 results. I replicated each task as shown in the videos. Could there be any problem because I am sure I didn't skip any part of the video?
SELECT *
FROM SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
Full Outer Join SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Hi Alex. I have a question. If i want to join multiple tables, lets say 4 tables. Which one will be used for right outer joins?"
9URM1_2S0ho,thanks alex.
9URM1_2S0ho,Thank you alex.
9URM1_2S0ho,Super confusing. joins
9URM1_2S0ho,"Hi Alex, I'm going fully at it to become a entry data analyst by next year. In this video I'm lost from 4:51, because I don't see more names popping up than what I coded into it at the whole beginning of this course."
9URM1_2S0ho,WHERE DID WAREHOUSEEMPLOYEEDEMOGRAPIC COME FROM IM PRETTY LOST RIGHT NOW I DONT KNOW WHERE TO EVEN START
9URM1_2S0ho,"@AlexTheAnalyst Can I update the values in a column with values from another table all at once or would I need to do it one at a time? For context, I learned some SQL a while ago but was using your videos for some much-needed review by completing a pet project cataloguing all the books in my house. The books have a unique ID but I belatedly decided to alter the table and add a foreign key (seriesID) since a lot of my books are part of a series. I have a series table with the series ID, title, author, and number of books already populated. It's about 400 books, 53 series. I don't want to update table 53 times for the different series if there's an easier way. I understand that I can query using GROUP BY or DISTINCT; I just want to know if this is possible. Please and thank you!"
9URM1_2S0ho,the 1st use case is something michael scott could do
9URM1_2S0ho,very well explained
9URM1_2S0ho,"alex, pls can you help me out , i am using azure data studio, and instead of sqltutorial.dbo, i am using master.dbo, but its not executing . pls help"
9URM1_2S0ho,"I am very sorry but I got redundancy in both table. How can I remove the duplicate record?

Ryan, Holly and Darryl"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Excuse me, I am not quite understand the available databases. In the video, I found that the available databases changed from SQLTutorial to master. May I know why it changed? Is it because we want to use two table in the meantime (EmployeeDemographics and EmployeeSalary) or is there any reason? Thanks in advance."
9URM1_2S0ho,"I have a question that probably has an easy answer, but I'm having trouble with. When doing a Left Join, how do I know which table I want to to be the left table? (and same for when I do a Right Join)."
9URM1_2S0ho,"Where and how do I download all the programs you are using, for a mac?"
9URM1_2S0ho,After struggling to understand joins today I came across this video and   it was so simple and straight to the point . Shukran!
9URM1_2S0ho,"@AlexTheAnalyst I think in 1st use case, We shouldn't have done ""INNER JOIN"". Look at the last person in EmployeeSalary Table, which is a salesman and doesn't have employee ID. If this person would have had the highest salary besides Michael, our logic for identifying the individual would prove incorrect."
9URM1_2S0ho,"Very good explanation of joints. Finally I understand it. It will take some practice to get it under the skin but hardest part of understanding it is finally over. I never understood it completely from other sources. Alex, the link for joins image is not working. Thanks"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Hello Alex. Thank you so much for your SQL tutorials, they are really consistent, explained in a really great pace, the best material I've found on YT to learn SQL. Just a quick question. Do you have any Intermediate Level SQL videos on Creating Views, GETDATE and Primary Key vs Foreign Key on your channel? Unfortunately, I was not able to find those ones."
9URM1_2S0ho,i think for the second case it's better to use Right Outer join because there is a salesman without an id in en the employeesalary table. thank's a lot for your teachings you are awesome.
9URM1_2S0ho,13:42  how to add one more name ?
9URM1_2S0ho,I cannot thank you enough for this simple explanation. I nearly exhausted my resources for JOINs and nobody ever explained well enough for me to understand.
9URM1_2S0ho,How do you know which table is the right table and which table is the left table?
9URM1_2S0ho,when i insert the new values in getting duplicates HELP
9URM1_2S0ho,"""Michael comes up with the genius idea of deducting 1000$ from the highest paid employee after him"" 
Why does that sound so like Michael though haha?"
9URM1_2S0ho,you used the office's character's name funny 😂😂😂
9URM1_2S0ho,Thank you for this video awesome explanation
9URM1_2S0ho,Really love your style with these videos. Using the office as a template for looking at these problems and techniques is such a fantastic way of going about it.
9URM1_2S0ho,Doesn't the average salesman salary you found at the end exclude the salesman that makes $43k? wouldn't it be easier to find the average without a join and just looking at the EmployeeSalary table?
9URM1_2S0ho,"my FULL OUTER JOIN stops at row 9, it just did not return the NULL rows, I don't know why that happened"
9URM1_2S0ho,"Hi Alex! I am really fortunate to have passed by a tiktok video that promoted your channel as one that offers learning guides in topics relating to data analytics. Being a person who would like to transition to data analytics at 32 years old, I still have doubts with regards to the unknown particularly on the things that still needs to be learnt. I have already finished your Power BI for Beginners and now into SQL. Though I have already finished the Khan Academy lessons on SQL, I found that there are difference in the codes used in SQLServer compared to I think SQLlite in Khan Academy. Like there we used ""TEXT"" instead of ""varchar(50)"" and also we use double-quotations instead of single quotations. Your explanation helped me a lot in understanding the concepts of LEFT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, RIGHT-OUTER JOIN AND INNER JOIN. There's one thing I am not sure of though. Why was INNER JOIN used on the last example? IS it because we are performing some sort of data cleaning and did not use salary data which does not have an Employee Demographic? Kudos and more power on your channel."
9URM1_2S0ho,Nice job Alex!
9URM1_2S0ho,I was part of a paid bootcamp but I learned and understood the concepts a lot better from your free bootcamp than that paid one.  Thanks a lot Alex. Highly appreciate your work.
9URM1_2S0ho,Great Job Alex

qzZU6LAtIig,So....you don't work.
qzZU6LAtIig,Do you write code

qzZU6LAtIig,I will like to politely point out that the video lasts 4:20.
qzZU6LAtIig,Looking to transition careers from the medical field. Are there any new data analysts that would be willing to provide any insight on what the job looks like or what the work schedule flexibility is like?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hello, could you make a video or tell me about the minimum knowledge and skills necessary to be a data analyst? In my case it is something that I like, I see many specializations for example in coursera, many courses, many videos on the internet but I left my high school years ago and I would like to improve my skills and employability. I would like to know more about specializing in data analysis what knowledge, for example, mathematics and skills are necessary."
qzZU6LAtIig,How many times have you used stackoverflow? 😅
qzZU6LAtIig,Thanks for that! I feel like there is a lot of work-life balance in this career.
qzZU6LAtIig,When do you take the time to learn new stuff Alex?
qzZU6LAtIig,damn those miles
qzZU6LAtIig,Nice Watchcollection :D .. thats data analyst money well spend ^^
qzZU6LAtIig,My kind of lifestyle though. Currently studying master’s in IS and Business Analytics
qzZU6LAtIig,"good to see there is no 8 hours of coding :x Im done with become data analyst and getting soon a job. But im still scared what is expected from a junior analyst. I love meetings (: how long would you say from 8 hours do you really spend in coding like:  prepare data, eda, sda, visualisation etc ?"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hello sir.  I  am a computer science graduate (fresher). I love to do summarization of data and analysis of data. I know excel, tableau and r programming. Should I go for data analyst? Please suggest me some advice?"
qzZU6LAtIig,I didn't see anything related to data in this video. Really a lot of nothing.
qzZU6LAtIig,I’m here because I don’t know what to do with my life after graduating in business administration
qzZU6LAtIig,Did I miss the work part?

qzZU6LAtIig,"Everyone wakes up in the morning
Everyone has breakfast
Everyone drive to work
zzzzzzZZZZZZZ....Get to the point. What do you do as a Data Analyst? For example, Do you write queries, Data Modelling, Report Building? Do you use DAX formulas? How much of Power BI or Tableau do you use? These are the kind of stuff people want to know. Show us those videos."
qzZU6LAtIig,Great video but honestly the baby got my like lol It's crazy to think that I used to drive somewhere just to sit at someone else's desk all day and do work and then drive back. I honestly think I was MADE for work from home lol also great watch collection!

qzZU6LAtIig,How much do you earn 🙄
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hey Alex, I recently found your channel and its been a gift. I do the data and quality for non profit organization and the job its pretty simple. I've been looking to get certificate in anything data related, and finaly found the Google Data Analyst Certification. I started on thursday, march 25, and i'm already on week 3. So far its easy, hopefully it continues like that. My goal is to learn as much as i can about data to become data analyst and work for a big company. Little steps."
qzZU6LAtIig,"LOL It's comically sad to see these videos now knowing what changed just a few weeks afterwards. (Going to check out the ""Quarantine Edition"" next. LOL)"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Basically it seems like you do maybe 3 hours of actual work work, and the rest of the time is on meetings and emails. Is the learning curve hard for this job? I'm thinking of doing the google cert and training on coursera?"
qzZU6LAtIig,"It's like you have done nothing during the day 🤣😂😂😂

That's why I don't like remote working"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hey!
What type of reports did you prepare? Did you use any specific programs or languages. Thanks"

qzZU6LAtIig,Hi brother! Please can you give me your phone number I want to ask you about some questions related to this field!! Thanka
qzZU6LAtIig,I just started getting interested in this field what should I do in college if I want to be a data analyst for a sports team? Any Advice?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Well, I sure know how to drive, play ping pong, and have lunch. Not sure if it's different for a data analyst. It was a nice video but I was actually expecting what kind of work you do as a data analyst on a daily basis"
qzZU6LAtIig,Do days ever drag or does it feel like time goes by quickly at work?
qzZU6LAtIig,Little man is adorable😍
qzZU6LAtIig,"Incredible video Alex! It was a great snapshot of a life as a Analyst! I have 2 questions:

I have a BS in Finance, 14yrs of Banking experience, 16yrs of Restaurant Mgmt. and because of Covid I was let go and I have decided to pursue the IT Path. After applying for a random good online IT school back in April 2020, I am set to finish school end of Jan 2021. However i am seeing that all these certifications I am retrieving are basically just pushing me into the Tech/help desk areas. I want to do Data Analyst as of last month. I found a online school that will BOOT CAMP me for 4 months with them (part of their payment structure ) will find me a job but take a % from my 1st month salary.
1) How do you feel about IT Boot Camp Schools in general and with those strategies ?
2) Do I just hustle myself with learning the SQL, Python, etc all the basics, scrub the resume and hit the normal traffic of job hunting?

I appreciate any feedback. Thanks"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi Alex. I work in an engineering field with a manufacturing company as a sales guy. With 10 yrs of experience. I do some basic stuff in excel as part of sales analysis. Looking to get into data analytics, I did PostgreSQL & Tableau courses in the pandemic lockdown time. I am now very confident after learning this backend & frontend tools. Some of my friends still recommend learning ETL tools like Informatica. And I find ETL tools are not open source and hence not able to work hands-on. So haven't started learning it yet.
What's your advice for me and do you have any ETL course on offer?
Thank you & Best wishes from India."
qzZU6LAtIig,I love your video! You help me get more motivation in choosing Data analyst as my main subject to study in college.
qzZU6LAtIig,Forgive my ignorance but whats the difference between a Team Standup to Team Meeting?  Cheers
qzZU6LAtIig,Good to see you're putting in your hours but heading out 'on time'. More to life than work
qzZU6LAtIig,Living a dream dude. Congrats for the success
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi, Alex thank you for your video. I have a one question.
Is a data analyst a common job these days? What I mean is most of different companies has the data analyst position?
And if you want to change into different area such as a biomedical cooperate as a data analyst, is it easier? or you need to have some domain knowledge about biology?"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Being a Data Analyst, do you spend most of your day in your cubicle? How often do you get to collaborate with coworkers and talk to other people? Do you feel like you just do the same thing everyday, or is there more variety than it seems?"
qzZU6LAtIig,Are you in Texas? This looks familiar
qzZU6LAtIig,Typical Fortune 500 company and uses Skype.  Why not Zoom which is much better.  I always have problems with Skype.
qzZU6LAtIig,What exactly do you analyze?
qzZU6LAtIig,How many years does it take to become a data analyst
qzZU6LAtIig,Are you based in Texas or North Carolina?
qzZU6LAtIig,I did master in math..
qzZU6LAtIig,Sir? Have you any job or work for me in your end?
qzZU6LAtIig,Do you like your job? Is it stressful? Is it boring? Would you recommend it?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Which industry do you work in as a DA? Different industry have different salary, right?"
qzZU6LAtIig,"We have data Analyst in my office ... when I saw your tag I was like “cool he’s in Texas!” Then I saw your office and was like .. “That looks familiar”.... then I saw you said your team meets up at the beginning of shift and was like “wait do we work together” 😂😂😂 your building has similar carpet and everything, weird haha . Seems pretty chill :)"
qzZU6LAtIig,Do you get to socialize/ network as well and take breaks or that doesn’t work in this kind of job style?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hey Alex! Great video man, and you’re kid is absolutely adorable 😩. I majored in political science, would you recommend taking an online course on data analytics to get an entry level position in the field?"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Please keep posting videos , i hope someday you get the recognition you deserve . Great content ! Take care Alex."
qzZU6LAtIig,"can u just stop playing bgm....I mean content is good , y cover that with some music, atleast decrease the sound"
qzZU6LAtIig,That's one BAAAAAAD Dude
qzZU6LAtIig,Thank you for this!
qzZU6LAtIig,"Have been working to be a data analysis, it not easy. Pls where can i start as a learner, python , power bi or tablaeu?"
qzZU6LAtIig,I used to work there lol. Small world.
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi Alex, I am a Psychology graduate. Do you think I would ever make it as a Data Analyst?"
qzZU6LAtIig,I have that same Orient mako!
qzZU6LAtIig,Sir can i land a data analyst internship in 2 months?
qzZU6LAtIig,"So it seemed (at least to me) that you actually spent a lot of time in meetings as opposed to time actually compiling and reporting data. Is that typical? I am looking into going to school for cloud computing, while I simultaneously hit a data analysis course at a local uni. I have only manual labor experience, so I am hoping this gets me out of the rain and into an office seat. I'd honestly be happy with an entry level job making 40-45k. Do you think that's realistic for someone with no office experience, fresh out of school, in a metro area? Thanks for the video by the way! This is appreciated!!"
qzZU6LAtIig,Love the content! After everything that has been going on with the pandemic I'm trying to get myself back into the habit of mastering sql and completing my udemy courses. I  want you to know your channel is helping me get that inspiration going.

what should i develop more and what kind of project should i do"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Nice video, this is definitely my dream job ! But im wonder if a degree in MIS will help me in this career..."
qzZU6LAtIig,Do i need bachelor degree!??
qzZU6LAtIig,You have such a positive vibe to your day. I started fallowing you to better structure my Data Analysis self learning and it's really helped my enjoy the process. Thank you.

qzZU6LAtIig,Great video!
qzZU6LAtIig,"Nice video ,im a student of business analyst ,so i like learn more about data analytics also,and im having a doubt,
What is most useful for data analyst ,is it learning about power bi or learning about machine learning (include python program )which is more useful to become a data analytics and for the business analyst ??????"
qzZU6LAtIig,Is business analyst a dying career?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hello ,i just graduated high school and This is a field I am beginning to get interested in ,but I’m on the fence because I hear this job very math related.i don’t mind math but it can get very confusing at times ,so I just wanted to know how frequently you use math and the difficulty at which you use it ."
qzZU6LAtIig,Love the videos!!! What earbuds are you using?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi! Nice video! I'm an ecologist and I have a good knowledge of R and Python. I also have a Master and a Ph.D. in ecology, but I want to change careers and work as a data analyst. Do you think it's possible? Even if I don't have a degree in Computer Science?"
qzZU6LAtIig,Do data analyst include programming language? I really wanna Pursue this field and I've basic knowledge of programming! Can I pursue?
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi Alex, first of all; nice video! I currently study International relations but would rather do data analysis after I graduate, therefore I am learning MySQL + Tableau (already know excel) and later maybe Python. My question would be if you need to know statistics? I know for Data Science you have to know statistics very well, but is it the same for Data analysis? Thanks in advance !"
qzZU6LAtIig,"Hi sir, im a fresh IT graduate and offered a data analyst job but i turn it down somehow because im scared that i cant make this job. And i think my major degree does not fit in the job. Can you give me some advice sir?"

I think it will be very great if you drop an assignment for people to practice anything they learn from the tutorial after finishing learning one step in this journey. For example, I just finished watching all of your basic tutorials for SQL, so maybe you can give me one case on the final video's description for me to work with, using all the components I've learned before. But all is great, Thank You so Much for all of these tutorials!!!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Wonderful Video! I just wanted to ask where I can go to get more practice for the SQL basics. Is there any free websites that can help me?!

LXwfzIRD-Ds,Just Great
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"LISTENING TO your lecture is like looking at my crush and say ""how lucky am I to live here"""
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"very useful , though i got kind of confused in the group count thing"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you for the simplest explanation.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,is the a discord or something for questions? Why no semi-colon to close queries? thanks!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Bitesize videos are awesome! Thanks Alex
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"To practice these basic concepts, where can I go to get free tables of data for me to practice on? I'm thinking sports stats ect,"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you so much alex❤️
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you very much for the knowledge. I am learning a lot from you Guru.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Day 2 of studying Data Analytics and I stop at this video for now, I'm gonna continue tomorrow with the next one and comment bellow the video I do at last that day"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,The thank you should be from us ❤
LXwfzIRD-Ds,I'm having a hard time trying to install SSMS & SQL Express. Is it beccause I'm on a MAC? In the mean time I'll work on your excel videos.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,I have told all of my classmates about your channel. I love all of your training! I'm an aspiring DS! Thanks for everything!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,What do you mean there's ONLY 2 genders?! 😂 Error Code 404 lol
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Thank you so much Alex.. it has been 3 days since I tried to change my way of learning to become a data analyst because it was just so boring and stressful before, and your channel really help me a lot! Can't thank you enough. Will visit your intermediate and advanced topics as well 🙌🏻"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you sir..!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Great classes makes me remember how much I like SQL. maybe should just do SQL. Thank you
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Done
LXwfzIRD-Ds,ربنا يباركلك يا بني
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks for the assistance as always!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"It is always difficult to listen to people for a long time and I always use fast forward except here with you, It is amazing how you are not boring to listen to! probably because you just say the point! Glad to find you :)"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks for the content.  How do we actually find and import data sets into SQL to practise on as you suggest doing at the end of this video?
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks man
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"It's good content in general. For the sake of education I'd suggest going the extra mile and always showing as much as you reasonably can. For example, when you're showing how the WHERE clause can still be utilized it would be nice to see a second query (and both sets of results simultaneously) where you also include the AGE column so we can see the results in a different form. It's not necessary but for beginners, visuals can be really useful."
LXwfzIRD-Ds,SQL at a very simplified level. Thank you Alex
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"On my journey through the boot camp...

I just realized that I could have resolved multiple issues before by simply using Group By. Thank you!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you so much sir for making such a wonderful tutorial.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks Alex!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,I am unable to connect to SQL server post downloading the SQL studio as suggested by you. How do I get this sorted? Need help.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Hey Alex, really appreciate you for doing this, you're an amazing person for taking the time to teach in such an easily-digestible manner. Quick question though, can you give some examples of how I can practice these basics? I'm having trouble coming up with ideas for things to make tables out of that I can then query. ChatGPT recommended making tables for library books or student courses, but I wasn't sure how to handle date inputs."
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"I've been following your channel and content for a while now. I completed the Google Data Analytics Certification from coursera and even though I really enjoyed it, the SQL part of that course wasn't as good as I expected. It took A LOT of time to get to this stage of the learning and you totally nailed it in just a couple of videos, which makes it perfect because you go straight to the point. I will continue this SQL tutorials to get a deeper understanding of the tool and to finally get projects to showcase this new skill.

Thanks alex!!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Got an entry level data analyst job (still haven’t started) but I’m watching these to learn the basics and be prepared. Thank you a lot!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,If i get a data analyst and change my actual life.. <3
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Here 3 years later. Thank you for these. I learn better from don't, so having an easy to follow tutorial is more effective than just reading and answering questions 😫"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Can anyone tell me how we can insert data in table. It's  not shown in the videos
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"thank God i bumped into your tutorials, you are the best"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Using The Office characters was ingenious. You’re a great teacher.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you Alex. I just finish basic part and that was amazing literally.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Great videos man! Where can i find some excercizes to better impress everything in my mind? thank youuu
LXwfzIRD-Ds,THANKS SO MUCH ALEX
LXwfzIRD-Ds,GOD BLESS YOU MORE ALEXTHEANALIST
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Alex, you are exceptionally good. I love the learning process, very easy to understand"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Currently going through coursera’s  google data analytics professional certificate and these tutorials are really helping me stay on top of my game with SQL. You make it so easy to understand!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Alex great video but I'd like you to create another video on this eloborating it further. Thanks bro
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Thanks Alex! You indeed saved my money. I am about to enroll an online course and have pay a big amount. boopps!!! But then I found your bootcamp. Im still in 6th video but I learned already a lot. Hoping to learn more :) I am actually don't have any background on this as I am commerce graduate.  :) Thank you sooo much for  sparing ample time for this bootcamp, I know this aint easy. God bless!!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Thank you Alex! 
Completed on Day 2, March 26 2023"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Hey Alex thanks for making this im really happy that someone is willing to offer knowledge transfer so willingly and not gatekeep. My question is I have completed Series 1. But now what? Obviously i can transition over into the intermediate series sure. But I definitely do not have the basics down. Unless I missed this somewhere i do not see any hands on experience besides following along. I tried Khan academy, but idk if its a glitch in their software but they dont actually explain if your doing right or wrong. You just move along. So how or where do we practice. Ill admit the easiest option is to just make things up and play around, but ill admit until im comfortable with the basics i dont know what i dont know so its hard to be creative when your still so new. (its like someone saying learn excel, or google sheets but if you have no idea what can even be accomplished or know what can be done your just learning a function.) I guess my only request is i wish there was more practice offered, or even references of where to practice that will help learn the basics and become more comfortable. Either way this is all great work!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you ☺️
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Hey Alex, Hope you are doing good. Just a query, can we not put column number in group by clause?"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,I m here again !
LXwfzIRD-Ds,2:16 one male who is female ? 😂
LXwfzIRD-Ds,🙂
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you so much
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Order By using Column Number this conecpt is new to me 
Thanks AA !"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,I’m on a roll!!! Time to go practical before the next tutorials
LXwfzIRD-Ds,I have done SQL Basics
LXwfzIRD-Ds,thank you ! well spoken
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"This is the most resourceful video on SQL I""ve seen so far."
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"You're a lifesaver, I took the Google data analytics course but still don't feel like I learned a lot or got enough practice. I've been binging your videos to help me create my portfolio."
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"When you highlight and turn it green, what is that button as I don't have that on my SQL?"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Done
LXwfzIRD-Ds,This is absolutely amazingly put simple. Thank you
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Oh my can't believe I just found out about your videos now! I've been struggling to move forward after finishing my Coursera certificate and wanted to improve my technical skills more and I must say the way you teach here is so enlightening. Your format is even better than that of Google's! More power to you my friend.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Thanks Alex! I'm a recent Google Data Analytics Cert grad, and after checking out your last video, I'm definitely motivated here watching your SQL vids and learning more!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thanks ! I completed the SQL. Basics series
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Hi guys, 
Firstly, thanks Alex for the great video! 

Does anyone know any websites with scripts like Alex provided for tables that we can practice with? 

Thanks!"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,tks appreciate all the videos and Im just starting with sql
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Omg what is distinct ... why not stick to rock bottom commands and just explain group by and sort
LXwfzIRD-Ds,So helpful. I found your page on accident. These basics were a great help. Thank you for your content.
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Alex, thank you! I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Cert that I thought was full of so much fluff and took too much time to get to the useful tactical information. Very much like a bachelors degree! In addition, it was such a broad overview of 20,000 topics. When I finished the entire cert I still felt like I couldn't do anything on my own. And it was all taught, of course, in Google-owned platforms. So THANK YOU for cutting right to the chase in your videos and using non-Google platforms! You are definitely helping me improve my working knowledge and feel more confident. -From a DPT trying to grow beyond patient care :)"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Thanks, sir"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"Thank you Alex, you've really helped in making SQL basics easy to learn and practice.
Q: Kindly assist clarify if using CAPS for the statements (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, e.t.c) compulsory? 
I used small cases and it seem to work perfectly"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you so much Sir
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Another well taught video than explained everything extremely well Alex!!!!!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,"i thought i knew about order by atleast, but didnt know we could use the column number too. you basically blew my mind right there.
Thank you. 🌺I'm going to binge watch all your videos now.😂"
LXwfzIRD-Ds,Thank you so much for this course! It's really clear and helpful!
LXwfzIRD-Ds,please for the tutorial where did you get your file from with the whole information
LXwfzIRD-Ds,thanks
A9TOuDZTPDU,Great Tutorial! A massive Thank you!
A9TOuDZTPDU,Why LIKE is not case-sensitive? I think something is going wrong 🤨
A9TOuDZTPDU,God is using you 🇺🇸❤️ thank you for the amazing content!!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Great video, i have wasted my time looking for a tutorial for long but this one is so clear to understand and the bite size videos helps to refresh and digest the topics easily!! Thanks Alex"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Can’t get the CQL download in my PC
A9TOuDZTPDU,ccc cút
A9TOuDZTPDU,Done unto the nexttt
A9TOuDZTPDU,Do caps matter when you're typing your queries?
A9TOuDZTPDU,another done of the coursee 20.01.24
A9TOuDZTPDU,Loving the tutorials
A9TOuDZTPDU,I thought I would not be able to find a mentor in this industry but I was proved wrong. You man are blessed and a blessing. Sincerest thanks from myself and my family for the ability for me to do a career change.
A9TOuDZTPDU,thank you
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Thank you for the great content, Alex! It would be useful to use a RDMS (for demonstration/practice purposes) that is compatible with Mac."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hi Alex
successfully installed and going through next videos"
A9TOuDZTPDU,6:56 I tried typing it but the names didn’t show at the bottom. I think I missed something. Help 😅
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Useful, thank you!"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"6:58 could it be ""Where FirstName = 'Jim' OR FirstName = 'Scott'""?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Finally🎉 I found  the right channel  for data analytics. 
Thanks Alex  for your  valuable information and  time"
A9TOuDZTPDU,The basics are very useful. Thanks Alex!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hello, first of all thank you!!!! I am learning with these videos (0 experience).  I noticed that on minute 7 when you were giving the example for 'IN' you accidentally mentioned ""AND"" however the 'IN' is used for 'OR'. If you state ""first name Jim and first name michael"" it will not give you a line because (in my mind...and since SQL did not return anything) there are no entries with both first names....OMG I can't believe I just wrote that!!!!"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Thank you very much!
It's an amazing lessons..
I've never thought programming is so beautiful , it was my problem during collage study!"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"concise and clear, thank you Alex."
A9TOuDZTPDU,I am starting my journey now. WHo wants to walk with me?
A9TOuDZTPDU,so glad I found your channel! Thank you
A9TOuDZTPDU,1:40 including Toby was a grave mistake
A9TOuDZTPDU,"This courses are perfect, but i was wandering, where can i ""train"" myself after studying them, i like to follow a video and then trying something by myself, there's a way to test me? btw, thank you !!! ill follow every video !"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Question: is <> same as !=?
A9TOuDZTPDU,We can use != instead of <> also right?
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Not sure if anyone is still active on these but when I try to use a SELECT* FROM with a WHERE query, it doubles all my values. On the original table all values are single but it returns doubles when I search and I’m not sure why? Appreciate any help! 👏🏼"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR Statements. 

In the example Alex writes,
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName = “Jim” AND FirstName=“Michael”; then explains we can use IN instead of multiple AND Operators.

In above mentioned query, we are looking for someone with both Jim and Michael as their firstname.

Instead, we are looking for rows where FirstName is either Jim or Michael.

We can achieve this by simply using OR operator instead of AND operator.

SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName = “Jim” OR FirstName=“Michael”;

Rather than writing multiple OR operator like above, we can use IN.
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName IN (“Jim” , “Michael”)"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"I was recommended your channel by a data analyst on tiktok. These videos are incredible easy to follow and, as somebody that is working on changing career paths, they give me hope. Thank you so much for making this playlist!"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"I am a pharmacist, kind of dont like my job, and want to learn this at my freetime i just started watching your videos and I am motivated to get a hold of tech things. I am 24 determined to become a CEO"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Couldn't you also, instead of a [Where FirstName='Jim' ] use [Distinct FirstName ('Jim')]? Just asking to see if I'm synthesizing the information correctly."
A9TOuDZTPDU,And this is why I'm doing this boot camp first and then doing the Coursea Google Data Analytics cert.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
A9TOuDZTPDU,And this is why I'm doing this boot camp first and then doing the Coursea Google Data Analytics cert.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Took me a few minutes to figure out that you were highlighting/selecting only the select & from statement and not including where. Knowing this selection option before running a query would have been very helpful in not getting an error every time I tried to run the query. Might I suggest your ""Bootcamp"" include in the beginning, an understanding of the structure and how SQL and the SQL interface works vs. jumping into commands and queries."
A9TOuDZTPDU,my problem is finding where the characteristics are in the keyboard.
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Great video! One thing to note, the IN statement isn't equivalent to Name = 'Jim' AND Name = 'Kevin'. It's equivalent to the OR (Name = 'Jim' OR Name = 'Kevin').

Nice job."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hi Alex, I love your videos and you have shared me tremendous knowledge. I wish you all the success to you and your family member. Your classes inspire me to learn everyday. I also would like to request you add do some Videos on Databases, snowflake, data modeling projects using SQL> It will  help me alot."
A9TOuDZTPDU,Done
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Starting my bootcamp journey today. So far really enjoying the videos, simple and easy to follow - thanks Alex!"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Thank you for helping me understand the LIKE statement!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"SO it's probably my fault but I want to understand why......when I typed the query stated in minute 6:58 the columns came out empty.
WHERE FirstName = 'jim' AND FirstName = 'michael'
 AND order is supposed to add specifics to the data selected so the row has to contain both names under first name column for it to be realized. am I missing something??"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"7:10 You can use ""NOT IN"" to generate the opposite"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Thank you so much Alex
You are simply the best"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"You are a wonderful Trainer Alex! Thanks for helping us learn SQL, Keep up the good work."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"On my journey through the boot camp...

I finally learned what is the use of IN statement. Thank you."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"You have a mistake in 6:52
(WHERE FirstName IN ('Jim', 'Michael')) is not the same as (WHERE FirstName = 'Jim' AND FirstName = 'Michael'), however it's same as (WHERE FirstName = 'Jim' OR FirstName = 'Michael')"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Hello Alex. You are a great teacher. Your simplified the tutorials
A9TOuDZTPDU,Micheal Scott!!! I see what you did there
A9TOuDZTPDU,"The things you learn when you go back to basics!

Had no idea about <> being not equals

does it depend on the rdms used? like this is in microsft sql but not oracle sql?

after a little research: most of the popular database models do allow != so that they are more consistent with other non database languages."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"6:44
If you wanted to include multiple entries based on first name, wouldn't you use OR and not AND?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,The whole content is amazing and very helpful but the cherry on top is 'The Office' references!
A9TOuDZTPDU,06:49 OR instead of AND
A9TOuDZTPDU,Super cool!Thanks for your work!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"When I finish the videos is not saving it as completed. I wonder why. I am going over them slowly, following the course. I hope it will be recognized at the end for the certificate of completion..."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Completed on Day 1, March 21 2023"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Easy piece of cake great explanation !
A9TOuDZTPDU,perfect
A9TOuDZTPDU,Hey Alex i want to congratulate you because this is really handy. i have a question with this SQL Application in particular. Is there any way to import tables from Excel to SQL? I just don’t understand why would you do tables on SQL when Excel is geared and already ready to have cells filled with information and much more friendly looking 🤔
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Wow! I am really enjoying this course. Alex, God bless you..."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Thanks Alex I am Surprised how you try to help people like me, I just started to follow your boot camp. Please wish me luck to find an entry level job as a Data Analyst."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Done, not sure how I missed this earlier"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"at 6:48, I believe you meant to write OR instead of AND"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"I just realized that the names are from the cast of the office! Great easter egg, Alex 😂"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Very helpful, thank you! Just glanced ahead at your intermediate and advanced playlists, that looks incredibly helpful."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hi Alex , How do you add all datas in SQL ?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"These tutorial videos are so clear. You have a talent for teaching – thank you, Alex The Analyst!"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"""...EQUAL for multiple things"" Oh Alex, how you simplify these things in such an easy-to-remember manner."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Thank you, Alex."
A9TOuDZTPDU,Thank you so much Sir
A9TOuDZTPDU,Thank you! The tutorials are great
A9TOuDZTPDU,Legend says he's still not back..
A9TOuDZTPDU,I really like how you are using the office characters' names😅
A9TOuDZTPDU,you can also use != for does not equal
A9TOuDZTPDU,"How to search a value in SQL, where start or ending of word will be different?
Alexa - it shouldnot be shown as starting and ending are same
Alex- it should be shown as starting and ending are different

similarly 
101- should not be shown
102 - should be shown

any idea for the syntax???"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"select *
from empolyeedemografphics 
where firstname <> 'toby' 
/* that is mikes order 😂😂😂😂*/"
A9TOuDZTPDU,great videos. Its not lost on me that the data set is the Scranton office staff of Dunder Mifflin paper company lol
A9TOuDZTPDU,Day 1 - 3rd Video completed ✔️
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hello guys , where can i pratice  these questions?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Learning more from these tutorials than I have in 3 separate courses😂👌🏻 Thank you Alex!!!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"I love that you used names from ""The Office""."
A9TOuDZTPDU,"On mine, when I try to execute for those times where the is nothing listed after the WHERE, I get an Incorrect syntax near 'WHERE'.  Everything else seems to match up, and work just fine.  Anyone else?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hallo I'm using mysql and the all the code seems to be working till now , is there anything wrong with this? Should I only just use ssms ?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Nice The Office reference there ;)
A9TOuDZTPDU,"@6:54 would not work if you used 'and', it would need to be 'or'"
A9TOuDZTPDU,please whats your twitter handle?
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Thank you for these set of videos on excel, and  SQL. Can you please do some on Tableau ?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,I love how bite size these videos are. Not overwhelming at all. Thanks man.. you really are putting my anxiety at ease!!
A9TOuDZTPDU,I just started my SQL journey with your videos Alex. You're an inspiration to me to change my career to being a DA soon. Hope this works out 😖🙏
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Forgive me for being pedantic, but I think you made a small mistake at 6:54

When trying it out at my end i found 'OR' to return both JIm and Michael's entries. 

WHERE FirstName = 'Jim' AND FirstName = 'Michael' -> returns nothing."
A9TOuDZTPDU,Amazing work sir ! These videos are damn helpful !!
A9TOuDZTPDU,Thank you!!!!
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hello, Alex.
Hoping you are doing good.
I'm from Bangladesh. I'm a student finishing my BSc on Statistics, R-programmer, and freelancer at fiverr where I do statistical analysis, visualization related work for clients.
I'm really interested in Data Analyst jobs. I found your YouTube channel from a video of Data Professor YouTube channel. And then I regularly watched many of your videos, and I found them really helpful and currently learning sql.

Now, my question is, you suggested python for different kind of data analysis work and other stuffs but if I could do those same works and stuffs using R, is it necessary for me to learn python? Are most of the companies in USA looks for python programmer or enthusiasts rather than R programmers?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,Excellent !!! Thanks
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Hi Alex, nice tutorials on SQL basics, please suggest if a string contains ""%"" then how to filter it using LIKE operator? Example abc%xyz?"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Dear Alex, 

I followed your video from last week. Learning from you. It’s been really helpful till now. But I have something to tell you. I know its bit funny, but in this video 6:56 min, you are using wrong command. 😀 
I tried to execute with AND Command but it suppose to be OR command(while explaining IN command)

Bdw your videos are really helpful. Keep doing it. 😊👍🏻"
A9TOuDZTPDU,"Now i just love playing with SQL!!❤
Alex u r great❤"
A9TOuDZTPDU,this is super great man :D thanks!

PyYgERKq25I,"Hi everyone. I need some help please. Why can I use all statements in the video except ""Top 5""? 
I am able to execute all statements in the video but once I write ""top 5"" there will be red zig-zag line below it and it say, ""Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'From'""."
PyYgERKq25I,your teaching is easy to follow i appreciate but how you got to the selection part is still confusing

PyYgERKq25I,Your tutorial is a blessing. You're the best data analytics tutor online that I came across with
PyYgERKq25I,"Why do sometimes you use parenthesis (or spaces, or capitalizations, etc.) and sometimes not? This is the type of information a beginner needs to know. I can follow along well enough but I am not learning much, only memorizing some commands. Appreciate your videos just not sure they are fitting for my ignorant beginner learning objectives."

PyYgERKq25I,"On my journey through the boot camp...

I got stuck with my database name with spaces. I learned that there must be [ ]  when you right FROM statement if your database name has spaces. But I guess it is not a good practice."
PyYgERKq25I,"Hi all - Looking to make a shift in my career and would love to complete this bootcamp. I am challenged with the download process because I am not sure what to select during the download process. If someone could provide some help, I would greatly appreciate it."

PyYgERKq25I,"I can't thank you enough, Alex! I went through a year-long bootcamp (absolutely wonderful experience) for web development and scored a software engineering role right before graduation. Shoot forward five months and I was let go as they were looking for someone with more experience (admittedly, I was slow but -hey- uber beginner). My husband is a BI developer and loves it and I always had such a love for SQL and its no-nonsense answers lol Hopefully, I'll be on my way to becoming a data analyst in the next year or two (I'm currently pregnant so not looking to beg for some measly time off). Thank you so much for putting so much work into these courses and giving them to the public for free!"

9o9loJpG-t4,I'm late to the party but got hired at 85k starting with zero experience and zero colleges.
9o9loJpG-t4,i was new zero knowledge about data analyst can you teach me as a beginner im not tech savy i want to learn this programming code how long it will take to learn into expert any link or suggest zero to expert
9o9loJpG-t4,"It sounds like she is saying ""median"" and not medium/average. And as data analyst we know what that means ;-)"
9o9loJpG-t4,Alex is a 9gager!!!!!
9o9loJpG-t4,Much respect to you Alex! Thank you for being as truthful as possible.
9o9loJpG-t4,Why are you upset
9o9loJpG-t4,I just got an offer for an entry level data analyst and it’s for $55k plus bonuses so I think 85k is high

9o9loJpG-t4,"Good day, I don’t know of any school in the US that would give me admission for a masters program in Data analysis because I don’t a Bsc in any computer related field or mathematics or statistics.

9o9loJpG-t4,"I'm a 2021 grad and ime it's bimodal. For remote jobs, non-tech companies pay 45-65k while tech companies pay 90-120k tc."
9o9loJpG-t4,"Fresh out of college with an analytics degree, have interviewed with a few places that quoted me at 60-70 (I'm in Southern California). Accepted an offer at 69k for an associate analyst role with responsibilities of utilizing Power BI, Excel, SQL. Perhaps later on after I've developed more hard skills in Python, ML, etc. I could find more lucrative positions but I think this is a realistic offer that is more representative of what's out there for entry level."
9o9loJpG-t4,Thanks
9o9loJpG-t4,"Alex, I have also watched this video like months back and this made me put wrong expectations in mind. Allah sent you as a whistle blower. Saved from stress.
Thanks.Respect❤️"

9o9loJpG-t4,"In India, for Entry level jobs companies are paying 8k$ p.a  and still they expect 2-3 years of work experience"
9o9loJpG-t4,Maybe she's talking about freelance Data Analysts? Maybe freelancers make more than W-2 employee analysts?
9o9loJpG-t4,"95k starting salary with 3 months of internship experience from the same company in San Francisco, ca"
9o9loJpG-t4,I appreciate this so much. Thank you.
9o9loJpG-t4,A data analyst who misreads numbers doesn't sound like a good data analyst.
9o9loJpG-t4,Doesn’t Median mean the point between highest and lowest? Average would be the Mean. Based on your previous video on salary and the definition of “median” I think she’s not necessarily wrong.
9o9loJpG-t4,California probably pays that.
9o9loJpG-t4,"I am 31 from UK, looking to change careers and have been looking at the career as a new pathway. Your videos are helpful and enjoy watching"
9o9loJpG-t4,"keep it real, Alex. i like this fact check things. good stuff!"
9o9loJpG-t4,I did my masters in data analytics at the national college of Ireland and I have more than 3 years of experience before my masters and I even not getting a job yet in Ireland. it's really difficult to find a job these days. And you guys are toking about 84k salary..oh man...yesterday I saw a job post on Linkedin and the company want to hire a candidate who has more than 15 years of experience for the entry-level..haha.
9o9loJpG-t4,I’m about to enter the field in a few months via promotion. I’d be happy to make 55k a year. I’m just happy to be a work from home data geek :)
9o9loJpG-t4,"Recruiters are happy by setting salaries ways up so they get higher commissions no matter how bad they do in people's moral, in businesses and the emlployment market."
9o9loJpG-t4,"I absolutely agree with what you quoted I feel she shall be talking of a domain specific analyst like Marketing Analyst or Financial Analyst or something like that 
Can You share the PDF that she shared?"
9o9loJpG-t4,I m an accountant running my own practice. I was wondering if I should learn “Google data analytics” certificate? I m looking for side hustle I m not sure learning google certification will help me land a side hustle. Can someone please guide me? FYI I m in Australia
9o9loJpG-t4,"Please don't come to my channel and fact check me! 🤣 

But on a serious note, thanks for this Alex!  Oh and I agree with you!"
9o9loJpG-t4,Robert Half is a big job placement firm in NY
9o9loJpG-t4,Can I get data analyst job  or guide me about data analyst
9o9loJpG-t4,"Alex, thank you for correcting the false advertising. She is probably looking wrong data. We truly appreciate your work. Keep it up creating more videos."
9o9loJpG-t4,"There is 2 dislikes..

One is : Her


That second one is : also her"
9o9loJpG-t4,I feel like there is an important difference between financial analysts and data analysts.  They function different.
9o9loJpG-t4,Yeah - anything outside of the Bay Area and NY is really tough salary wise. But it all coincides with cost of living.
9o9loJpG-t4,"I know plenty people here in San Francisco and NY, who are making 80-100k out of college. it really depends on your tool set and how many languages you know that can benefit the company. But outside of ny and sf area, salaries will definitely drop. the median pay in the bay is 80-100k. I think NY is significantly lower."
9o9loJpG-t4,How is the demand and future for data analysts Alex? as I am planning to enter into this field
9o9loJpG-t4,She has good video titles but I find the content to be *extremely* boring.
9o9loJpG-t4,I appreciate your rant. Her information was extremely misleading. I appreciate that you looked it up and provided us with accurate information!
9o9loJpG-t4,The fact that she says it's the *median* salary is important. She didn't say it was the mean. Something to consider.
9o9loJpG-t4,"I would disagree with her 85k is way too much for starting. I've had conversations with many of my analytics professors and they say on average entry level is between 55-65k given you have a decent understanding of Excel SQL, Python/R. I've also been applying/interviewing for entry level jobs and I would say it's been around 60k but I'm located in Massachusetts. Salaries may be slightly higher. Love your videos!"
9o9loJpG-t4,"Anecdotal Pay for people curious:

My Entry Level Analyst Pay: $48k | Regional AVG: $40k
My Mid-Level Analyst Pay: $68k | Regional AVG: $62k
My SR-Level Analyst Pay: $86k | Regional AVG: $76k

Region: Florida - Central FL
Years of Exp: Entry: 1, Mid: 3, Senior: 5
Education: AA Degree
No Certs
EXP none relevant until Entry Level position
Skills: SQL, Excel, PowerBI (by Senior started working in stats & R)

I could've made more money if I'd negotiated or moved more jobs but I got to make my schedule at each job and live a full life."
9o9loJpG-t4,I'm making 100k after 5 years of experience.
9o9loJpG-t4,"Thank you man, your videos are super informative! What do you think about data analyst course offered by udacity?"
9o9loJpG-t4,Thanks bro bro
9o9loJpG-t4,She deletes bad comments lol
9o9loJpG-t4,"Dude, yes. Love your content and respect you’re setting real-world expectations. 

My first data analyst role was 72k <1 year of professional experience but required high level excel, stats, sql, and basic understanding of Python. 

It’s a complicated industry where titles are mixed around vaguely describing responsibilities. A lot of the lower paying data analyst roles may be leaning more on the reporting responsibilities of a business analyst.

Edit: I’d expect 80-85k entry level for a data scientist who is familiar with creating algorithms from scratch and stuff."
9o9loJpG-t4,How did I find this channel so late? You are amazing ❤
9o9loJpG-t4,"Holy Smoke! I just found both your channels!

Now, I'm confused."
9o9loJpG-t4,Lol i saw that video and totally didnt believe it and had to fact check it too!
9o9loJpG-t4,Entry for me was 70k but I live in the ny tri-state area which  has a high cost of living.
9o9loJpG-t4,"Late to the party but I just recently found your channel (Loving it). I think perception through average overall gives people a skewed view of salary because wealth distributed across the world is skewed. I think using the median helps paint a better perspective because that shows what will the actual middle man get paid. Suppose the lowest end would be like 10 dollars mid would be 100 and the 100th percentile would be 1000, average salary would yield a much higher value than the median. So people go in thinking they would get paid a lot more, but in reality it is just because people on top makes a significantly larger salary than those in the middle and the bottom."
9o9loJpG-t4,Wow. Thank you so much for making this video. I actually watch her videos as research on data analytics. I completely believed her when I watched this video. This is exactly why independent research is so important and not taking what anyone says on youtube as gospel.
9o9loJpG-t4,"I think most of these salary guides are bullshit tbh. It's just such a one dimensional view of the employment market. For a start, any data analyst will tell you that you need a better idea of the distribution, whether that be a box plot, the IQR, something like that and the majority of salary guides only have the median. This seems one of the few cases that has some extra details. And then they don't appear to define the job titles correctly eg: miss out roles which logically should be there."
9o9loJpG-t4,"Thank you for this video. I'm 12 years into my IT career and make 80k as a Sr Systems Engineer. I am road mapping my path to six figures and have been focusing on data analytics, because I was under the impression it pays in the 100 - 120 range as standard. I'm learning R and Python and was planning on SQL and Statistics next. I have a degree in mathematics, so I do have some experience there. 

I live in the Midwest and there seems to be an incredible amount of wealthy people around, and I have to wonder what they all do to make so much. I am doing well but am still paying off student loans. I don't live extravagantly by any stretch. 

Now, I should also qualify, I made way less for most of my career, having graduated after the housing crash in 08. It was a VERY slow climb to get to this point, and I was making lower than average for every title I'd had, until last year. 

I am not certain exactly what to do; maybe I should pursue an MBA. Maybe become a software developer. I want more for myself and am willing to work for it. The path just doesn't seem clear."
9o9loJpG-t4,"I had a 10 year career ending making 60k, took a 13 year career break, and now i'm on contract . . at 32.25/hour.  I was hoping to make 70k coming back in, but hopefully this contract is a good stepping off point for me."
9o9loJpG-t4,"Alex, it is true, depending on the industry, i work in oil company and they pay min 80k year just knowing excel basics and some power bi, if you know python, ML, power bi and dax you can scale it up to even 90 to 100k year between junior and middle level"
9o9loJpG-t4,"Ok so here's my official mildly researched take: First of all you are probably looking at a different source than what she looked at. This is the 2019 Robert Half Accounting and Finance Salary guide. it forecasts salaries for 2019. The Job you are looking at seems to be specifically for Data Analysts in Corporate Accounting. Robert Half has other salary guides such as the Technology Salary guide. I think She probably looked at the tech guide for 2020. I saw your comment saying it doesn't look like the 2020 version is out yet, but it was definitely out at the time this video was created. I found an article from August 2019 discussing the release of the 2020 Guides. According to the Technology guide, In the tech industry A ""Data Analyst/Report Writer"" Makes $84,750 at the 25th percentile and $100,250 at the 50th percentile (which should be at least approximately the median, I think). These sound a lot like her numbers, she may have taken the 25th percentile and reported it as an entry level salary statistic, which while not entirely honest, is probably not too far off for this particular set of jobs since your entry levels are generally going to be the ones around that 25th percentile mark (i think). Now I'm still not confident we should take the rest at face value. first of all I don't know what proportion of Data Analyst jobs fit into ""Tech"" as opposed to other fields like finance. second, Robert Half is an HR consulting Firm. Their numbers are based on their own placement, and I'm sure that could skew the data, I just don't know how. Also worth considering that She seems to have a very specific idea in her head when she talks about data analysts, different than what most people might think based on job titles. She clearly thinks a lot of ""Data Analyst"" jobs are Not real Data Analysts despite being labeled as such. Maybe this is misleading on her part, but she seems to bring it up constantly so idk. for example: I've seen your video about becoming a Data Analyst with no experience. Based on the way you describe your first data job making 47k I'd imagine she'd say that's more of a ""Data Reporting Analyst"" type job, which she frequently distinguishes from ""Data Analyst"" when she talks about Salaries (not to mention the fact that you got the job seemingly without a particularly relevant degree. I don't think you said, but I imagined something like Psychology or Social Work based on your first two jobs. She usually talks about Math degrees as common for data analyst). And personally, as an aspiring Data Analyst and Aspiring Data Scientist who has spent time around echo chambers like the r/datascience subreddit, I probably Wouldn't think ""Data Analyst"" when I hear that job description. When I think data analyst I expect more statistical tools being involved. For example I'm Working thru a fairly popular textbook called ""Introduction to Statistical Learning with R"" which covers the basics of applied statistical techniques like Regression and Support Vector Machines. I've been under the impression that This is the kind of stuff associated with the term Data Analyst (Along with data queries, and cleaning and stuff)"
9o9loJpG-t4,"84k did sound high to me. but ~40k also sounds low to me. When I did job searches in my area (which is a city) I saw a lot of entry level stuff from like 55-75k. Entry level stuff past that was usually labeled ""entry level data scientist"" or something like that. Also, I might be wrong but it seems like higher salaries would make sense based on the kinds of degrees these jobs seem to ask for. I almost always see them asking for at least a bachelors in a ""Quantitative field"" which usually includes Math/Stat, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Computer Science, or engineering. And I could be terribly mistaken as a student with no work experience but I was under the impression those degrees had a tendency to command higher salaries (especially Compsci and Enee). that's what I always hear at least. And I also sometimes see that a masters degree is preferred. I certainly hope people aren't taking on loans for a masters degree to make just 40k. But idk, maybe I've been Naïve and I have a rude awakening coming up after graduation."
9o9loJpG-t4,"45k is correct, this is where i am as an entry lvl analyst and we doing just sql server and excel work."
9o9loJpG-t4,"So while I definitely don't agree the numbers are that high, I did find that on Robert Half's 2020 Technology Salary guide, Data Analyst/Report writer did have the numbers she was stating."
9o9loJpG-t4,My son got 63 k entry level in1920.
9o9loJpG-t4,"well , Now we know she a horrible data or business analyst LOL"
9o9loJpG-t4,"Its so funny you reviewed her I watch half of one of her videos and definatly felt her content wasn't quality and way to stiff. I found you soon after, your information and types of videos  are more relatable to  my demographic (  Female, 30s, city life,  persueing new career prospects due to quarantine pandemic, Museum Masters - most museum are long term closed).
 You are clearer, positively engaged and connect with other research I've done reviewing the feild. Keep up the great content. I appreciate the videos you share with everyone."
9o9loJpG-t4,"thank you im only 12 but this video rely helped me learn since ive been trying to find the salary 
I already know that i want to be an data anylist"
9o9loJpG-t4,You came with receipts Alex! 😂
9o9loJpG-t4,Also how does she have a bunch of videos about being a data analyst yet SHE CAN'T EVEN INTERPRET DATA IN THE MOST BASIC OF WAYS?!?!?!?!?!
9o9loJpG-t4,"She said median, not mean - so the population/sample referenced is skewed somehow. Or maybe she doesn't know what the median is."
9o9loJpG-t4,"You are spot on! For someone who is fresh from college this is spot on. 
Where it gets grey, is someone with a wealth of industry specific knowledge that is making a career change. When you really understand what drives the data, the corner cases that can only be learned from experience, understanding the landscape (cx, executives, partners, psychology) and having rock solid relationships. Will get you quickly into this range. However, you'll also be more of a senior equivalency but with entry tech skills."
9o9loJpG-t4,"Hello Alex I appreciate your videos. I have watched the lady in your video on YouTube and I think I might be making a mistake. I am looking to get into the data analytics field. I am starting from scratch, just learning Excel. But I contacted her and she is charging me $250 for 1 hour of coaching to get started in this Field. Is this a bad move and a waste of my money?"
9o9loJpG-t4,"""Average salary "" seems so broad. Aren't people really more concerned what is the ""average salary"" based on where I live? Why would someone care what the total average salary for all 50 states is versus knowing the ""average salary"" for a data analyst in Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex for instance ? Hope this helps. Is there a way to just narrow it to the area you live, that is what most people want to know anyways."
9o9loJpG-t4,"I dont get why shes making it up, even a 45k starting salary is pretty dam impressive"
9o9loJpG-t4,"well, you did well by researching but i would have suggested you discuss it with her and let her make the corrections herself instead of coming out here to denigrate her reputation....besides, you even said yourself that she made a mistake...who is above mistakes by the way?"
9o9loJpG-t4,She is such a troll. I have been looking for information regarding DA/BA roles for a bit now and I realized that her videos provide absolutely no value whatsoever. I have learned more from your resume review video alone than all her videos combined. Thanks for providing honest information and ACTUALLY help people. (Just imagine having to work with her ehhhh)

If I was a recruiter I would find these % increased revenue statements on a cv, very pompous and taken out of the air. Very, very bad trend."

3. Can you able to tell me which type of job i can apply? (without Experience)

N8f7NtDpbxA,Thanks
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Hi Alex, I am from completely different background (Mechanical engineering) and I just got my first job as a Business Analyst!!! Ton of thanks to your channel!!!"
N8f7NtDpbxA,Hello Alex.. love the videos I have learned a lot since watching your videos. I am trying to find a job as junior or entey level data analyst can you suggest (or anyone in the comments) any online recruiters?
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Hi Alex, thanks for producing amazing content. I'm trying to break into data analytics/business analytics and I'm wondering at what point do you decide to work with a recruiter to find you a data analyst job? Would you say that I should finish the portfolio projects first and then start looking for jobs? Or would you say that I could contact recruiters while working on my skills? Thanks."
N8f7NtDpbxA,new insight. thank you alex.
N8f7NtDpbxA,"thank you for actually giving advice on how to network. all my friends are like ""just network and you'll find a job!"" and i'm just like ""ok how do I do that...."""
N8f7NtDpbxA,I cannot find where you can say you are applying for jobs on LinkedIn
N8f7NtDpbxA,Thank you so much sir ... Your videos are highly motivating. I think this strategy was for me actually 🤠 ... Will try it for sure n hope this time I will have success.
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Great information Alex, I've been following your videos on becoming a Data Analyst.  I am working on my Google Data Analyst Certification now. Do you have any suggestions on internships once completed.  I'm concerned with my lack of experience in the field but need to get working. Thank you and keep putting out great content!!"
N8f7NtDpbxA,"How can I hide the fact that I'm applying for other jobs on LinkedIn?

Some of my coworkers are connected to me on LinkedIn..."
N8f7NtDpbxA,Do companies in the US or Europe hire remote data analysts employee from other countries or this role is basicly  exclusive to the local people and they must be presented to the work place?
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Very unique and highly valuable video here!  A couple of questions.  Can you recommend any recruiters for data analysts that place people in remote jobs?  If not, besides LinkedIn are there other places to look?  I am guessing Google.  At what point would I be ready to start accepting recruiters offers....A good website portfolio with a handful of projects on github, strong understanding of Pandas, relevant packages and MySQL? I am very curious to your response.  GREAT CONTENT!!!  Please keep it up!!!"
N8f7NtDpbxA,"What a useful video! It has just popped up in my youtube flow. I just want to say a BIG THANK YOU for your awesome and informative videos. Keep up the good work!
And a small story:
I had no idea what to do with my life. I wanted to learn something which suits me. It was very very very difficult to find it, almost impossible. I got lot of inspirational stuffs here in youtube such as motivational video from Arnold Schwarzenegger. He said, the first rule: Have a vision! Now I know what to learn and what would I work. Without your videos it wouldn't be possible!
I have vision. (Learn data analysis)
I have career goals. (Be a data analyst)
I have dream. (To be one of the best data analyst)
THANKS!
God bless you Alex!"
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Thanks Alex, it good to have a recruiter. I will find a good, experienced recruiter in an effort to be in my desire position as a business analyst or data analyst."
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Hi Alex, how did James comissioned  after getting you the job? Did you pay him or the company that hires you does it?"
N8f7NtDpbxA,But what I felt after job hunting for several months now that recruiters are not after helping you out rather they are helping out their clients finding the right candidates. They presents lot of candidates for one job. Then how can you say they are motivated to find you a job?????
N8f7NtDpbxA,"Hi Alex, can you please share the name of the recruiting company that helped you? Thank you very much!"
N8f7NtDpbxA,Thanks Alex! I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to land a job at a law firm. Looking forward to it!

wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi i just discovered your channel. Thanks for the helpful content. I want to break into the data analyst field but I have some reservations. I’ve never had a professional job. Just a few customer service call center jobs. I currently work in the public sector in a clerical LA County position. I want to break into the data analytics field but I am discouraged. I only have an associates degree and some university units towards a sociology degree. I have considered data analytics bootcamps. But I think it’ll be a waste of time if I still have no degree. Is it difficult to break into the industry with no bachelors?

wcKzdRVsMOw,How did u loose your hair
wcKzdRVsMOw,Thanks
wcKzdRVsMOw,I can relate so much to everything you said!!
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hey man! Great videos. One question though which course to start from? Is google data analytics course on coursera good to start from?
wcKzdRVsMOw,What is the difference between data analyst and big data?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex, Thanks for guiding us through the video and giving insight into the same. Can you Please your LinkedIn profile or can we connect through LinkedIn? I want to have some basics discussions regarding the transition as a data analyst. My Linkedin Profile - linkedin.com/in/rishabh-agarwal-038b74123"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"maaaan, if only  was that easy, to learn a skill + putting it in your cv and apply to job and being visible to recruiters. I have applied to nearly 80 internships and only got 4 interviews with 0 rate of success since they mainly look for engineers or technical studies"
wcKzdRVsMOw,We look very much alike AND you live in Dallas too? If I take this career path it’ll be interesting if I get hired at the same place and see my doppleganger there lol
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, I have been following your channel for quite sometime and you are doing an amazing job 😊. I am from India and I have 6+ years of experience in data analytics(sas, sql and a little of tableau). I have been trying to get a job in europe but I dont get call backs. Can you help please."
wcKzdRVsMOw,Jalapeños!!!! Thank you Alex! Your video is very inspiring.
wcKzdRVsMOw,good stuff!
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, if you think getting the first Data analyst job is very hard, then I think I have no chance.  Should I save the heart ache, but I am already proficient in Python, SQL and Tableau, and 25% completing 'Google Data analytics Professional Certification'. My family does not rely on my income, work becomes hobby, so the pressure is off.  Maybe you should set up a DA career coaching club.  cheers, Judy from Melbourne, Home to Australian Open Tennis"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hey Alex.  What was your first video in your channel so I can try to watch in order?  I am curious about Data Analyst and I actually like SQL but not brushed up proficient yet.  I am also the weirdo that likes Excel and refreshing skills in that for starters before jumping into say a Tableau or Power BI.  I know the struggler will be real with Statistics but I am willing to push through with it (LOL).  Any help is appreciated.
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Thanks for the video!

I hold a B.S. in applied/pure mathematics and have 14 years worth of experience in the chemical industry, but I feel the need to change and do something more fulfilling.

How did you decide between data science and data analyst? I have been accepted into a university data science masters program which will take me 3.5 years due to having some programming prerequisite classes, but it seems that if I acquire the skills, I may be able to break into data analytics sooner with my degree and some certs/programming experience under my belt.

Any thoughts and opinions would be appreciated and valued, thanks!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I've been watching your videos lately, since I'm interested in changing carrers, any advice for when you don't feel smart enough and Impostor Syndrome is trying to eat you? LOL"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Do you know the software MicroStrategy ? Is it data visualization? In my current job I got access to it where I can pull data and use it to analyze . Maybe this might help me transition to a data analyst role as I’m currently an engineering analyst role
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, I have been following you since long time I really like your videos and you content helps. I have been trying to switch my career to data analyst for more than 1 year now I have reached on very low moral of only I am not going to make it. I have learn SQL, Tableau power BI basics of python.. Still while applying for jobs I feels skills are less and that lower my confidence. Please help and guide"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello, I recently graduated with a major in finance and a minor in accounting and I’m wondering what steps I should take to become a data analyst? Thank you."
wcKzdRVsMOw,i can tell you are a great guy...i subscribed. i am a math teacher. should i consider data analysis or software development?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex, How connect with OR follow you through linkedin?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Greetings Alex, I'm 33 and I have passion to shif my career to data analyst. I have bachelor degree in nutrition and food technology and I'm not interested anymore, so kindly advice would it work... 😞"
wcKzdRVsMOw,I am a graduate from EEE.Is it gud for me to apply for data analyst for masters?
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi Alex - I’m a medical coder and am curious if you anything about what kind of background I’d need to become an Epic EMR analyst. I’ve applied to tons of these positions and keep getting turned down. I have  a bachelors in Health Information management and an AS in Health IT. Any suggestions?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I have great reservations about promoting this field of ""data analyst"". Industries recruit from professionals from within their industries. In healthcare, you find nurses working as data analysts. In real estate, it is agents. In finance, you have bankers or finance majors. They mostly preen by putting analytic software on the resume. Insider contacts is key. Except in a few areas of the country like Texas. Oops. You live in Texas. Why did it take 4 months to get one of these jobs. This sounds like a bad career move."
wcKzdRVsMOw,Really good video! Im trying to Switch from nursing to healthcare analytics so I'm hoping for the best.
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey man really glad I found your videos, I just graduated college last month with an information systems major and have been applying to a bunch of junior data analyst positions, I haven't had an internship or any experience in the field so sometimes i feel under qualified. Would you have any advice you have for a recent graduate trying to find a job?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I'm also going to subscribe you. I have also interested in Data analysis. I'm working in E-commerce domain as an Application Engineer. Before that, i was working for Healthcare domain upto 5 years and during that period i was able to understand data analysis. And it turns out to be my passion. So really want to connect you. Thank you for motivated us."
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi Alex i have completed my bachelors degree on nursing science but i am really interested to work as data analyst in future.. can you please suggest me any pathway from where i can start learning...
wcKzdRVsMOw,"What should I learn to start my career as a data analyst...
What is the basic requirements for this"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"What is the odds of me getting work/contracts without a degree?

Just considering heading down this path now... Am coming from hospitality, (was self-employed up until the outbreak. Am business minded) so my background won’t do me any favours either.

Thanks for your thoughts"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi Alex. Looking to get into this field. I am coming from the hotel/hospitality sector and wondering if Data analytics is worth the career change?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex,, i graduate from college back in 1998. however i have never worked on same field , I have been working in Retail store for last 2 decades, recently i took class of Sql and BI, i am just not sure about how to land a job and have a good Resume ,, if you can help i will really appreciate it 
thanks"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex
I am working in telecom company as network engineer. How should I manipulate or get the recruiters attention towards my resume? If I do get interview opportunity then should I mention about my last domain or should mention something like using excel,SQL in my last company?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Is graduation required in computer field for applying data analytics course?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi, TQ for this video. Really it gave lot of inputs for similar kind of profiles....can share anything abt. certifications for data analyst jobs....."
wcKzdRVsMOw,Hi Alex. I wanna switch to become a Data Analyst. Would you advise against getting a diploma got it vs being self taught. Does not having the certificate/diploma/degree for it hamper your chances?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi, i have been working as Business Analyst now i am looking for transition in Data analyst. I have applied in quite a few companies but didn't getting any calls. I am learning SQL, Python , EDA visualization. Can you help me with resume building"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex, would it be a good idea for a person who is over 41 years old to change his career to data analyst?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex, I recently graduated in the career Industrial Engineering and Management in Mexico, I’m really interested in data analytics, so what’s your opinion about this area in Mexico? and what can I do to be a data analytics?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, what are some sites to practice sql and python for data analytics and  what are some projects a beginner can do?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Thanks for the video Alex. Just a quick question, I'm 30 years old now, do I still have a chance to change my career and be a data analyst?  I mean, are the IT companies welcoming the idea of  junior / entry level data analysts at my age? 

Thanks in advance!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex. I'm currently transitioning into becoming a Data Analyst. But I'm working in a different field. I have completed my degree in Business Administration. However, I have huge gap in my studies because of personal reasons and so I'm trying to study via the resources provided by you and fill the gap and for which I'm really grateful to you. But I still don't feel confident in what I have learnt and seeing other people with better degrees/knowledge makes me wonder do I need to go for a full time degree in order to get a proper job?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex. Thanks a lot for sharing. Here in China the competition is really fierce. For most of the time companies just look for someone who is single, better not to be woman and 100% bg fit is required. I am thirty now. I graduated with my software degree and have eight years experience dealing with business and data in telecommunications, e-commerce and fintech. I used SQL and power BI in my previous project,   I also learn machine learning by practicing in python. I gained my certificate in quan, and I also have three months work experience in one of the biggest internet companies. My previous job is not analyst in title, i worked as consultant and internal auditors. it feels so suffocating, i got none interview during the past. One of the job hunters told me they prefer some one will possibly not take maternity leave, someone who worked in internet all the time. This is weird that people would get married and give birth to a baby at any time, not only a 30 year old woman but could also be a 25, 40 woman. It seems like there not to do but to leave the work. I This makes even want to leave my country, sorry for saying that. China is a great to live and not a good place to work in. so disappointing."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"i have a dream... i want to be a Data Analyst in malaysia ( i'm from Algeria). i'm working really hard to achieve that dream, i'm learning programming with python, C#, i'm learning descriptive and analytical statistics using RStudio, i hope that i'm going to succeed , and your videos are really helpfull :D thank you so much :D"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I'm currently transitioning into becoming a Data Analyst.  I was already doing a lot of analyst work through Excel.   Last month I put in my resignation but offered part-time so I could study more to get those certifications and learn SQL.  My company offered me a part-time role in my current position the last month and starting today a part-time role starting today as a Data Analyst that will transition to full-time in January.   I passed the DA-100 and  the 70-778/779 last month.  I have a lot of industry knowledge with my company including the processes of multiple departments, but I don't feel confident yet in my SQL and Python abilities (still learning those for sure).  About how long did it take you to feel more confident in your skillset?  I study for about 6-10 hours a day on days I work and 12 hours on weekends.  I feel incredibly lucky and don't want to mess up this great opportunity."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, what do you do about letting people know on LinkedIn you’re seeking a data analyst job if you’re already employed and your company doesn’t know you’re looking to leave?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"This might not be an important question,  how many jobs did you apply to land the first job?
I’ve applied few but I feel like I should apply more"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello alex!
I am currently a last economics student and started taking an introductory course after my university opened a minor in data analytics. Starting learning python online, what do you recommend me doing to make my resume more attractive when starting to search for jobs?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,I'm currently studying economics and accounting at university. How could i get into data analysis?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"You got me, I subscribe.  
I have seen some of your videos, and I am now in a transition stage, in my current job I have had to analyze a large amount of data, polish and clean it, and I realy loved it but it is not one of my functions, the company was recently in the need to generate a large amount of data related to machines (I am a process engineer), but thanks to that and also while talking with a friend who is a web developer I discover about Data Science and Data Analitycs. Your videos are realy useful, and thanks for sharing you experience."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex!
Hope you're dowing well 
I'm a student at human Genetics and I'm very passionate about learning and getting into DS and DA, but all i have basic knowledge of R and python
What can i do to become and expert in this field?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I come from healthcare too, EMT, and currently live in NYC..scared that there isn't going to be any jobs available by the time I learn basic data analyst roles. My goal is to develop apps and programs and to be a software engineer, and thinking data analyst would be a great stepping stone, do you have any opinions on that? Haha thank you!!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Alex new subscriber. I have a question. So I am 38. I went to school for graphic design years ago. But I am currently a painter at a school I just started and after a year I will get free tuition to any 12 state schools here in MD. I really want to be a full stack developer but heard that it is much easier to get your foot in the door thru data. So I guess I am asking for any advice. I want to take advantage of free college a year from now. But I am slowly teaching myself to code now. I was learning HTML and CSS but just recently switched to SQL. So yea any advice??
wcKzdRVsMOw,I'm a computer systems engineering student and I'm ready to be a data analyst intern however I cant find any intern position as of now. I can only find internships for software developement. Do you think that if I take the software developement internship it could be easy for me to transition to data analysis? I've seen a lot of similarities in the requirements for both positions
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Wow, thank you for this video! I did a bachelor's of science and then did more specialized training in naturopathy, but it was more of a passion than what I saw for myself as a career. Throughout school I worked in fitness, clerical, and teaching. Currently working as a Data administrator and thinking about what my next steps are to achieve my career and lifestyle goals. At this stage of my life I'm considering things I hadn't thought about in my 20's, like salary projections, career outlook and demand,  level of challenge, and portability.  So far I was considering doing a Diploma in Health Information Management or Business Administration, yet a school I spoke with suggested looking into Data Analytics. And here your channel is. I'm so excited to watch and learn from you, thank you!!!!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex,
I need your suggestion to switch my career into data science. I'm a Python developer with 2 years of experience, basically into health care domain. I'm more interested in data analysis. Could you help me out with suggestion how to change my career? Should I have to apply for Entry level data analyst?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"it might be hard for the employers to make a solid assessment of the candidates when it come to data analytics skills during the interview,  and if candidate claimed that he has all or the majority of the technical skills needed, employer would feel doubtful about it."
wcKzdRVsMOw,So you just learned sql? What resources did you use ?
wcKzdRVsMOw,Thanks for the Info. I have done btech in mechanical engineering and i am planning to do masters in maths next. With some sql grip would i be able to land a job at data analytics?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex,

I have experience in Mainframes Technology and I had worked in a few projects where SQL was used, but now I have 5 years of gap in my career due to some personal problem and I am exploring the new tech which I can learn to start my career again. Here is my question, I am not good in programming so it is fine to make career in Data Analyst? And how long does it take to learn all the required skills to crack interviews to get the job?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, 

I did my engineering in Electronics and then pursued my MBA in Marketing, and have been working in an Indian MNC as a Team Manager, now the job that I do is redundant and straight-off boring as there are no technical skills involved, except for a bit of Excel! Also, the money is really less.

Anyhow,  I have decided to switch over to Analytics as my career path because of my recent affinity towards numbers/data/Statistics, now because I have Zero knowledge in programming at the moment, I am focusing heavily on brushing up my Statistical knowledge post which  I will be taking courses to learn SQL, Python, Tableau etc. to land a job as a Junior Data/Marketing Analyst, and then progress slowly in the coming years towards becoming a Data Scientist, obviously that's a little far-fetched for now.

So, what would be your suggestion for me to secure my career transition? Any advice would be highly appreciated, 

Thanks in advance, Alex!

God bless you and your family,
Much love and support from India."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex!


I think that I really needed to see this channel, because actually I feel stock in what I'm doing right now, I've been working as a facilities manager for so long time and just tired of it :(

I came to this channel to convince myself to search new knowledge and opportunities and I want to believe that analytics might be the way"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I just found your channel & started to binge watch. These video are amazing!  I'm currently a nurse, and want to put in the work to switch careers for data analyst. I just don't know how to look attractive to employers without a Bachelor's in CS, and only a AAS in Nursing.  I plan on getting a SQL cert, and making a website showcasing future projects like you suggested in the comments to someone else. Not gonna lie though, it's very discouraging not having that piece of paper."
wcKzdRVsMOw,How long did it take to get the grasp on SQL?
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Great video Alex, loved hearing you describe the interview process, and that it can take a long time. Very realistic, but also reassuring.

When you said you studied lots online to pick SQL skills, what did you eventually put on your resume?

Did you do any projects that you could use to show your actual skills?
How did you decide that you had learned 'enough' SQL to start applying for jobs?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex,
I am trying to change my career into this field by self-learn.But on ground level I have been struggling with it for past two years,till now, I have struggled a lot to get proper SQL with data analysis tutorial. I am currently into database programming mainly with SQL but with Analytical SQL , it is different .
 I can learn the basics of analytical SQL but I am finding it quite hard to get HANDS-ON with Analytic SQL like windows func,etc. 
There is this one course in UDEMY where I have found the best course for SQL along with business Real use case for a data analyst - ""Advanced SQL + MySQL for Analytics and Business Intelligence"" 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ENOUGH TO USE OTHER FEATURES OF ANALYTICAL SQL IN TERMS OF BUSINESS USE CASE.
Hope, you feel free to give me some insight on this.
Thank you very much!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex I am Gulshan I finished 6 months data analytics course from Springboard.Worked on some projects using python ,SQL, Excel ,power bi and now I am looking to get job.I domain is marketing.and looking for entry level job in data analytics.please help me what should I do because I lost my job in this pandemic"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey, Alex. I'd like to ask how much time did it actually take you to prep for becoming a Data Analyst? Did you have to leave your previous job? If yes, were the recruiters apprehensive about the break in your employment?

Full disclosure, I'm a CS graduate who finished college last year and was working for one year as a junior tech writer. I had to leave this job due to complications caused by COVID and now find myself at an impasse at my career. While I have started working as sports writer just to get an income, I am really looking to get into the Data Analyst profile but I'm worried about having little to no experience, and even though I've started to read up on the latest technologies in the said field, I realise that I'll need a few months to get the hang of it before I actually feel like I can work as an analyst in a corporate environment. So it's making me really anxious as to how badly the lack of work ex would affect me. 

So effectively, how many months can I give myself here before I make things complicated for myself? Any response you could provide would be very, very helpful for me.

Please and thank you."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Holy shit you're in Dallas!? I'm in Fort Worth! Currently taking an IBM data science course .. had previously taken a course on Google sheets and fell in love with it so I thought I'd take a shot at being a data analyst as I'm between jobs right now.. I'm also an artist, and was thinking the domain knowledge would make me a good fit for something in entertainment... Any advice on how to land something like that out here?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey Alex, I cannot believe I found your videos on YouTube!!! I was having such a hard time finding some real and relevant information on this subject as most of the people talk about data science. 

Since you've been enough to offer you expertise in helping data analyst newbies, I wanted to ask your opinion regarding my case. I have been my whole life a travel specialist (airfares and ticketing specialist) and have no other experience whatsoever in data analysis. Since the whole world changed during the past few months, I am now looking for a second career, and I have always wanted to work in this field, but since I don't any education (my bachelor degree is in philology) or experience I always hesitated to try. However, I have already started learning Python a month ago and will focus on SQL also.

Given your knowledge and experience in this field, do you think I have any chance of getting a job after taking all the learning steps you recommended? I have many communication and customer relations skills, as well as working with many software related to my job. 

Thanks a lot for proving all this extremely helpful information!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Thanks for your honesty 😊
wcKzdRVsMOw,Big question. Would working as a medical billing and coder be a good way to get my foot in the door in this career field? Can it lead anywhere into the data analytics field? I ask this because my VA VR&R counselor is trying to sway me to go this route since the medical billing and coding program that my counselor would hook me up with also helps with job placement. At least from here I figure I would be working and would have a budget to pursue a masters in data science.
wcKzdRVsMOw,"I can see that you have great experiences in your role, can I ask what the next step is for data analyst as people always want to climb up the ladder,  for example, a data analyst in sales team for analytics, how do they go to management,  what is the long term goal for them?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hey Alex. Thank you so much for all your crystal clear information. I have done the weirdest academic accomplishments. My Bachelors degree is in Geography. And I did MBA concentrated in MIS. And now I want to become a data analyst, so taking some online courses to get familiar with SQL and Pandas. 

I’m so sorry to ask you, but do you see any hope that a company find me as a good candidate of entry level data analyst. And I’m 34 years old..."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Great video on your experience to your career change! I was in your exact situation from transitioning to analytical roles. Prior to that I was an engineer. While the problem solving traits was an advantage, the key is really embracing the tools that analysts use from research and self-learning. Keep up the content!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex,  Thanks for the video. It was inspiring. Actually i also want to switch to data analyst profile from a different background. I already started learning SQL, python and has already done number of codes in both. But i don't understand how to start the demo projects for data analysis. Could you please guide me where to do the data analysis projects and what else do i need to practice before i start applying for data analyst jobs?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex, love your content! I'm in the web analytics side of things (Google Analytics, Tableau dashboards). What are some good skill sets you'd recommend I focus on? Thank you!"
wcKzdRVsMOw,How to contact you please
wcKzdRVsMOw,Great  video
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex , ty for sharing your knowledge and exprience, im without a degree and thinking about learning to be a data analyst , im 37 years old, i spend hours on the computer from home working customer service but im not great with computers but i getting better, would like your opinion about going into the data field in my age(37) and also is it possible to work from home as data analyst. thanks :)"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi there Alex. I'm PhD student focused on basic research on the biomedical field (rodent models). I'm used to process data about my research purposes and have a considerable knowledge about medicine(mainly epidemiology, pharmacology, statistics). I'm interested in the heath data field once it has many jobs opportunities. I'm starting to training my skills on SQL, and already i have a good bases of excel and data visualization. Do you think that my background as basic researcher is a considerable feature compared to someone that is starting from the beggining?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hi Alex,
What were you doing before you became a Data Analyst?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex, 

Thank you for this insightful video,  I am a pharmacist with some  experience in pharma sales and marketing. I started learning Python and SQL 4 months ago with Datacamp, udemy and youtube to become a data analyst. Am through with the Datacamp data analyst with python  course but I feel I am not job ready. This is because I don't have any major data analytics project in my portfolio and most job i see require an educational qualification in computer science, or statistics . Please what advise would you give me and can my previous pharma job experience play any role in getting my first data analyst job. Thank you for your anticipated response."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello Alex, I am an Engineer from Aviation industry (Singapore) and recently really interested to switch my career into Data Analyst. I have no basics of any analysis tool, or maybe only Excel for basic daily use. May I know what will be the first skill you suggest to develop in order to switch into this career path and get an entry/junior level Data Analyst job maybe in future few months time? Thanks for your video and it's truly inspiring and motivating me in doing this."
wcKzdRVsMOw,"Hello, Alex. I am Punit Pandit. I thinking of making a career switch from Electrical Engineer to Data Analyst. I have just started up by taking Pyhton for dummies book as a course. I greatly appreciate the online courses you shared in the description. So I am an Electrical Engineering major from the beginning with no professional work experience whatsoever and by seeing the requirements for Data Analyst jobs, I am getting a feeling that I do need to get enrolled in a Master in Data Science program. What do you suggest?"
wcKzdRVsMOw,Thank you for this video I am ang electronics engineer and starting a career shift to data analytics.

Is it good to put a degree you are currently pursuing (not completed) along with work on resume."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex, I've been a longtime follower of your channel. At the age of 27, I made the uneasy decision to switch to IT. I was always wondering what I had to do to land a new job, and your videos helped me a lot. I started working on projects and studied essential skills.

Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"you are my favorite youtuber regarding data analysis. you take everything from scratch and i understand even technical aspects so well. Moreover, you keep in mind the non-technical essentials like portfolio website and resume making. Hats off sir. Thank you for giving so much value."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,What about certifications?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,how about applying for roles that did not require viz tool or sql proficiency? am I making a mistake applying? it talks about kpi but not tools we will use.

Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Very nice video, all i can say is thank you."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex, thanks for insightful  videos on your channel. I am on my new career path into data analytics, I have a 3years of  experience in content writing domain; however no experience in data analytics domain. How can I present it in my resume? Please guide. Thanks in advance."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,no wonder why he don't have many followers. wasted 10 minutes
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hello Alex, thank you very much for your videos, they are useful and entertaining at the same time, gives me more motivation to learn :) Could you please update the link for the 3rd resume template, if you still have it? The link shows an error. Thank you :)"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thank you for doing another fantastic video. Super inspired !
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thank you so much Sir!
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,What would recommend placing in the objection section if you have no experience in Data Analytics
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex, thanks for all the informative videos you have done. When one is on a new career path, Is it necessary to include one's previous experiences in a CV especially when they're not relevant to data analysis? Thanks."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Is it still best to keep everything on one page?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex , what if those 3 sections only don’t fill the page ? I, for example , have only had one role as a data analyst and I’ve only been in it for a year. What do u advise I add to not make my resume look sparse ?"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thanks !!!
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,3:06
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,can someone share me a template of last resume name as patrick haloom
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Will make a resume now based on this
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Great video Alex thank you so much!
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Thank you so much, Alex!"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Being a automotive technician im having trouble building my resume for future applications. Im currently getting my associates in computer science but have zero work experience in anything data related.
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thanks
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT!
Honestlly, I cannot tell you how much I hate people who won't shut up about their soft skill.
""I am a good leader"",
""I am a hardworker"",
""I am a master communicator"".
Well, no shit, Sherlock. You are surely doing some master level of being a jackass.
Seriously, thank you. Soft skills are called soft skills for a reason. They are not something that can be shown. It is something that can only be by how you carry yourself throughout work day in, day out. Not some lame excuse of why I should give you this job when you can't even do a simple ""Hello world"" code."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex, thanks for your contents. In my experience, there is no universal rules, it depends on the country you live in. In Italy, for example, the personal picture is almost mandatory. The recruiters want your photo because they use it to remember you (this is what they say)."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Strongly recommend NOT using graphics such as charts to illustrate skill level. Its highly subjective to the reader since 25 year senior software engineer's '4/5' would be a 25/5 for a student.. and vice versa. Plain and simple is the key
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex, I am trying to download the third resume template but it seems it's no longer available. Can you please share an alternative link?"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Is data entry/ typing experience worth it to keep in resume for data analyst jobs?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Alex, I believe your link #3 under ""GOOD Resume Templates..."") above no longer works and must have changed on the hloom site.  You can Download This Template directly.  I found it on their site by navigating via the menu at hloom.com (Resume-->Resume Templates), then scrolling down to the ""Free Resume Templates"" section, clicking link ""Basic Resume Templates,"" and finding this template 3rd from the end of that collection.  I'm sure anyone could find it easily, like me, but thought I'd let you know."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,When somebody has non IT experience and looking for job as data analyst do u think we should put the past experience
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"A big caution with a lot of the resume templates in this video is they all have some form of columns in how they're formatted. While they may look great to a recruiter or hiring manager once you get an interview, most job applications are going to be submitted online and uploaded to an applicant tracking system (ATS). For those that utilize uploading an electronic document (Word or PDF), the ATS is going to have a hard time distinguishing different areas in columns. This may result in have to clean up or simply enter manually all the information the ATS is looking for like contact information, skills and work experience."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Thank you for such a good resume update Video. I just let my job recently now looking for job, this will be great help. 🙏"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex,

Pls suggest where should I put my IBM Data Analyst Certificate...in education or certification section?"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,I appreciate your videos. Not that I mind paying but we need to pay to get the resume from your top choice link. Just FYI
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,HI Alex am still at school.i wanted to ask is it possible to link java or python with google sheets?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"What if I do not have an experience. Each template has as experience section you showed.
Kindly guide me. I am going to apply for junior data scientist post. But I am confused about m resume."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi Alex, thanks for sharing this insightful information. Can you please help to review my RESUME?"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hi, The top recommended resume template is not available now. Can anyone help with that? Thanks in advance! :)"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Hi Alex. I have math and engineering degree but no related data analytics experience. It seems almost impossible to get a first job as a data analyst
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,How would this resume change if you were first trying to transition into a data analyst role? I'm a financial analyst with two years of experience looking to transition into  a data analyst role. How should I reflect that in my pitch and resume overall?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"""because then there would be another person more attractive than me in the office..""

Haha! Well played."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"What about for students who are just stating out?
As a fresher how should it be?"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Hey.. I like you videos and found you very motivational. Here in Germany, it's always good to include photo in resume."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,What should freshers with no relevant/substantial work experience do?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,Thanks for always creating relevant and helpful vids! Is it possible to get an updated link to your preferred resume?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"we would like to have a student version of this!
If you agree, like the comment!"
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"Thanks for the advice! Would it be possible for you to create a video showcasing how to build your project portfolio? I'm making the switch to the data analysis field and know absolutely nothing about building a portfolio, except that is a good way to showcase skills and experience. Thank you."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,amazing super useful videos 👍 what do you think about Microsoft certifications for SQL and Power BI (Power pack)? are they really necessary for finding the first job or might be a help?
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"I slightly disagree with the skill bar way of showing how proficient one is. I saw a video from Joshua Fluke where he argues that different people use different parameters to evaluate their skills. So what does a 75% filled bar mean? How different is it from a 80% filled one? How do you quantify this? Also, perhaps employers could look at a non-100% filled bar and say: ""if he is not even secure about his skill set, why should we hire them?"" or they might not see a 75% filled bar as enough, even though your intention was to show you have a good grasp, but still has some room to improve, for example. I don't know, just felt like noting this because I like the concept and how it looks in the resume, but I think the disadvantages of the interpretation behind it outweigh the advantages."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"According to on the resume expert, we are supposed to have three resumes for three different purpose. 1. For job boards: Resumes are selected by recruiters with help of ATS, scanners which uses frequency of keywords to select about top 'x' (i.e. 25) resumes. This means a resume with more keywords with high frequencies has higher probability to be one of those 'x' resumes. That means it could be 4 pages long.  2. For human: When recruiters or HR contacts you, send them a one page resume but very easy to read and follow. 3. For job interview: Take a single page resume, but designed as a marketing material as presentation with key achievements. I would appreciate your comments on them."
Ns-8Jsa3mEM,"I just completed online courses from Cornell to be certified in data analytics. Would you put this certification in education, experience, skills, or something else?"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thanks for watching! What is the weirdest thing you have (or used to have) on your resume? I think mine was the granola company...
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"If you have the Google data analytics certification, where would you include this in your resume?"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Dear Alex, 
Thank you for your valuable video. 

Can you please share the resume template link?"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thank you for this video.
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Question should I go to a university to become a data analyst or is their a cheaper option?
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex, about Waterfall and Agile SDLC methodologies, how do you need to understand them in order to claim that they are one of your skills? I kind of understand the basic concepts, but I'm not sure if I really understand it enough to put them on my resume... Do you have a good course recommended or this is something that relies more on experience? thank you!"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"your videos are so helpful.thank you for this amzing videos i had learned so much from them 
but i am b.com student from commerce background but i wanted to beocme a data analyst i love working with sql.would you pls share a resume to be prepared for b.com students"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Impressive😄
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hi I have a really important question is photo in resume good or bad?
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Hey Alex isn’t this too much for a resume? I was told one page maximum. Queries are brilliant idea for a resume!
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"I just finished the SQL tutorial for beginners all 4 videos and continuing to watch all your other videos as well. I Appreciate your information and ability to explain to someone who is making that transition in their career. For what its worth, thank you so much for helping others."
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hey Alex, so I’ve done SAS (in a core module from my degree) which has a lot of similarities with SQL. Do you reckon it would still be useful to send examples of my code even if they don’t ask for SAS as into many companies use it?"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hello Alex, do you think that sending a document with a script is better than giving a link to GitHub/Portfolio in the Resume? This is the first time I see someone sending actual code with the resume, it's cool, but if I would get something like that, my first question would be ""why the person doesn't just give a link to GitHub""..."
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thank you !!
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex, great video! I am taking the Google Data Analyst Cert.  to switch to data analysis, what's the best way to find a job?"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,The idea of simply sending some of your queries is genius. I’ll be using this in the future. Thanks for such a useful video!
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"This is a gem content, Alex! I didn't know showing the queries you know would be beneficial. Will try to add this in my next application. :) I wanted to ask if you also showed the result of the queries and/or was asked about the data that you used?"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Great video! I have a question though. I am from the humanities (currently working on a History PhD). Have you met analysts with PhDs in unrelated fields like mine (considering they have managed to learn the necessary skills for the job)? Thanks!
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex, im business data analyst from Argentina, and i love your videos. This is the best video on YouTube for data analyst workers. Thanks a lot!"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex, 
I was wondering your thoughts on including queries you wrote on your current companies database in your application? Is this exposing potentially sensitive information even if you do not show the query results (just the code)? Thanks"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"Hi Alex,
Very good video, I learnt a lot from this short video. I have been searching the web on Data analyst resume but did not see anything useful or I could relate to.

But this video says everything in under 8 minutes. Thank you so much.

Another thing is the resume is very simple, short and straight to the point."
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Great video. Thanks for posting.
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"wow ! thank you so much.this is really helpful. But i have a small doubt, I can only see the option of uploading resume on company's websites usually. How can i attach those extra files like SQL queries and all while applying online to showcase our work? please let me know. i would be so thankful."
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Thanks for the video. You might want to double check the most recent experience part where you mistakenly listed C+ as a language (I think you meant C++).
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"The video is really educating, but I am a fresher, so wanted to know if you are going to make a video about how people like me can do to get a break as a data scientist/analyst."
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"How do you feel about including online courses in your resume? I  have 2 Nanodegrees from Udacity, and does it hurt to put them in like a professional development section in your CV? I have a bachelor's and currently rounding up my Master's and looking to get a data analyst role. And I live in Germany, and resume of 2 pages is mostly recommended"
4rfr6A3lO-Y,i really wanna be an analyst can you make a video with what you need to be an analyst like what GPA you  need and what money you earn and how good it is
4rfr6A3lO-Y,This is the most useful video I've found on data analyst resume! Thank you very much for sharing all of this publicly
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Where is the template?
4rfr6A3lO-Y,"The code example was good. I include links to articles I've written on analytics + my github. I don't think anyone clicks on them. Having the code physically in their face as an appendix to the resume seems like a better idea. Issue I'm finding in getting data analyst jobs is companies want someone results-oriented, but the HR filter is hard to bypass when HR asks for a bunch of software / tool skills. I've solved million-dollar problems at companies via analytics, I have an MS in IS, but I don't have 5 yrs experience in SAS, R, etc.. so, don't get calls. It feels humiliating."
4rfr6A3lO-Y,Could you share the link to the template used?
OTq2NRy_AGs,"Would you rather work at a BIG Company or a Small Company?
Thanks for watching!"
OTq2NRy_AGs,How long to stay at the smaller company! I'm wearing 5 different hats everyday its madness
OTq2NRy_AGs,This is really interesting 🥰 I think I would love to start in a smaller company  because I am more interested in learning as much as I can at this stage. Money will come later
OTq2NRy_AGs,"You explain it well, I had same experience."
OTq2NRy_AGs,I would rather work at a BIG company!
OTq2NRy_AGs,"Hello, at the age of 35 after having experience of about 12 years in small and mid size organization, should I join big company for stability, pay and experience? Please advise"
OTq2NRy_AGs,I definitely am open to either but I can see the benefit of having more access so that you are more efficient. Working at a smaller company definitely gives you the chance to do every aspect of your role rather than it being divided by a larger team. Benefits to both!
OTq2NRy_AGs,"Had the same experience, I can endorse everything you said!"
OTq2NRy_AGs,"Literally I relate to everything you mentioned, I am also a Data Analyst and started my career in a small company as a Lead, now I am in a huge company as an Analyst and I get paid more and have more benefits, but my job status is lower :)"
OTq2NRy_AGs,Great advice.
OTq2NRy_AGs,I like your voice.
OTq2NRy_AGs,Thanks
OTq2NRy_AGs,"start from small company, will have so many exposures"
OTq2NRy_AGs,I think you hit the nail on the head with the differences. The great thing about small companies that I enjoy is exactly what you said - the opportunity to learn multiple skills that you are less likely to get to know in a big company.
OTq2NRy_AGs,"I currently work at a small company as a Data Analyst/QA for an out of the box EDI Processing system.

While my predominate role is data analysis/QA, I've seen myself wearing a few hats.
My first year, I was doing general support as well for the department, along with data analysis and QA.
My second year, I'm seeing myself doing internal/test case development and more escalated support as it was recently established I would no longer do general support tickets and only take stuff on occasion.

I personally like wearing a lot of hats as it helps me grow, but I'd like to work at a big company as well."
OTq2NRy_AGs,"Love it!  I worked at a medium-ish company which had been bought out by a larger company out of the country, but they werent very involved in the daily business yet when i was there.  I know EVERYTHING within a year - but was unable to get a promotion and eventually left for a family break.  now i'm a contractor at a very large company and i've been there almost 6 months and feel like I know nothing!  its also harder to get noticed for other roles because everyone is so overwhelmed all the time.  there's definitely more potential to learn more skills at the larger company but i do miss knowing people."
ya28cb3zFGE,"3:23

ya28cb3zFGE,"I am doing data analyst right now.which is going good untill now.i hope in future i get job also related to this too in canada 
Thank you for sharing 
I was little scarec before"
ya28cb3zFGE,Your route is so inspiring. I have a double major in Supply chain management and accounting and always enjoyed the analytics side of it. Using excel at the time. Now I am working to transition to a Data Analytics role. I am so happy to find you
ya28cb3zFGE,Here from the future
ya28cb3zFGE,"This is really inspiring. As this video was made more than two years ago judging from the dates on some of the comments, I want to believe that you are now making far more than $100K a year. Congrats for this channel, Alex! You give us belief."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Good day , please how I get a remote job from company ,am fro Nigeria and just concluded Google data analyst (Coursera) , please kindly help me"
ya28cb3zFGE,Video 3
ya28cb3zFGE,Did i heard it right?76k an hour??really how many hours did you work sir for a month?
ya28cb3zFGE,"What’s funny is I also currently work at behavioral health hospital doing a similar thing, and now going into  data analytics, but in Chicago lol"
ya28cb3zFGE,I have an interview for a fund data analyst. I'm not the biggest fan of excel but I know how to keep up if that makes sense. I have an interview coming up that is going to be for 90 minutes. any advice?
ya28cb3zFGE,Starting from the beginning again watching your videos as I complete my master's in data science. manifesting a data analyst job when I graduate in December. Hoping to comment that on your latest video then! thanks for being such an inspiration.
ya28cb3zFGE,"I started a bootcamp program last month, I previously worked healthcare aswell making 11/hr starting and at max got 13, however during that job, I was getting familiar with submitting reports and problems like patient numbers/disciplines and admits/discharges and whatnot. So i was kind of getting introduced to this world? Now I'm jobless but spending time focusing on my side gig and diving into data analysis fully... hopefully I can get to those big bucks."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Very good, Good people to do there best for there families. Keep up man. :)"
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hi, I am moving to canada in March 2022 and currently I have experience in banking and education sector ... I am already learning SQL power bi python and Google sheets ... Does this help to get a job as a data analyst in Ontario and can you please advice me what else I need to do to be secure a job as a data analyst"
ya28cb3zFGE,Are you still in the states? Nice story.
ya28cb3zFGE,Wow!  Thanks for your video!  This sounds like my journey.  I started as a mental health worker and trying to transition into a Program Analyst position at a hospital!  This was very encouraging!
ya28cb3zFGE,awesome content man! I’ve always wanted to go after this type of career but I always second guess or doubt myself! Hearing your story gives me inspiration
ya28cb3zFGE,"I took a Bootcamp program this March 2021, I learned 10 weeks of excel, SQL, and Tableau, and 3 months later, I found a job paying 75k + 10% bonus, it doubled my salary as I used to be a staff accountant. I think I'm extremely lucky that I'm able to find an entry-level job with such great compensation. I live on the west coast."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Would it be reasonable to say that as a current business analyst with 7 years experience, I can get a job as a data analyst quite easily? I currently make 90k a year and would only accept a job that offers the same or more."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Alex will you conduct data analyst course,"
ya28cb3zFGE,that's awesome man. Sounds like things worked out for you!
ya28cb3zFGE,How and when did you learn your minimum ti even get the first good IT job? I get the impression that you study IT stuff in college or maybe hi school.
ya28cb3zFGE,"Wait...so, you just jumped over from doing unskilled labor to doing data analysis for them? This was glossed over too quickly, as it reveals a huge truth about getting a job. It's more about WHO you know than WHAT you know.

I assume your data analysis skills at the time were less than one would expect for an entry-level person to normally get hired with, but you were able to break into the data analysis field because they already knew and liked you. And after that, having some actual data analysis work on your resume gave you a huge leg-up in applying to other jobs via more traditional methods.

I'm just not convinced the data analysis field is all that good of an opportunity for most people. It seems most data analysts either transition into the role in their current job, or go through an internship as they're wrapping up college. Meanwhile people like me trying to start a new career are a dime a dozen; people with just the basic skills and certifications, being ignored by potential employers, and drowning in a sea of competition.

Whenever an entry-level data analyst job opens up online, within mere hours there are hundreds of applications already submitted. It seems rather hopeless, unless one happens to have a connection already with the company. :/"
ya28cb3zFGE,I have seen one of your video where you have discussed Udemy Courses. I'm on my way there. Started with python 💪
ya28cb3zFGE,Are there any training programs that teach these skills?
ya28cb3zFGE,Do you need a college degree to become a jr data analyst?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Great information. Where did you get your data analytics training? College or self-taught? I'm interested in making this kind of career switch and am considering the Google course. Any suggestions are appreciated. BTW Did you go to college in NC? ECU in the house, lol. Thanks."
ya28cb3zFGE,Do you need to go to college in order to get into this career?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Very happy for you, thank you for passing on so much knowledge and inspiration too!"
ya28cb3zFGE,Is there any way to make a good amount of money as a data analyst out of college?
ya28cb3zFGE,Did you take any classes to learn how to be an analyst? I'm 3 years put of college and have been working customer service jobs. I recently finished the Google data analysts certificate and right now I am working on my portfolio and mastering R and python before I start applying to jobs. Thank you for telling your story. Such a motivation :)
ya28cb3zFGE,can we pursue a 2 year pg diploma in Data analyst after doing masters in Mathematics???...ND wat are the scope of it in canada 🇨🇦?
ya28cb3zFGE,What certifications would you recommend?
ya28cb3zFGE,Did you mean $76 per hour or 76k per hour?  Either way.... amazing!!
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hey Alex! You are reall inspiring. Can you be my mentor? If yes, please mail me at rokayaneeraj@gmail.com I would be extremely glad to hear your response."
ya28cb3zFGE,i thought you were studying to become a doctor.
ya28cb3zFGE,What is the difference between a Data Analyst and a Business Intelligence Data Analyst?
ya28cb3zFGE,What are the chances of getting a Data Analyst job with beginner level skills in programming languages such as Python and SQL?
ya28cb3zFGE,I’m from South Africa and 24. How can I apply or to which company can hire a data analyst from this side?
ya28cb3zFGE,"I have a non-IT degree and my work experience as well is totally not related to IT. Will you still recommend this to me? Planning to take a certification but unsure if this will require at least a knowledge to coding, IT or programming. I just want to make sure that my time and effort in taking Data Analytics will be fruitful."
ya28cb3zFGE,Hi Alex! Thanks for your story. Could you tell where you learned data analysis
ya28cb3zFGE,"Your videos are truly inspiring. I'm 37 and have decided to make a career change. Now I'm graduating with a bachelor's in business analytics and have been working pt with my employer in an analyst role working with SQL and excel. I am also working a pt gig as an intern at a fortune 500 company too, in IT working with big data. I want to get in a full-time junior data analytics, but man the job market seems soooo right now. In worried I won't have anything by the time I graduate"
ya28cb3zFGE,Alex I need your help. I am an accountant in Australia. Do you think I should do new Google data analyst certificate? If I want a side hustle in data analyst.
ya28cb3zFGE,im in nc too can you help me get a data analyst job?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Your video title mentions no experience? And, that sounds like a lot of years (and therefore, experience) before you got to $100k??"
ya28cb3zFGE,"I am 20 and I am also learning data analytics from udacity. Except the little bit of stats, everything seems extremely fun to me. I will try to look for internship after the course completion. I am kinda afraid about it's scope in India. How it is for freshers. I hope i will get some money figures too here. Can you give me some precious and essential tips ? Thank you and btw good channel."
ya28cb3zFGE,"So the insurance company didn't have a problem hiring you as a data analyst despite that you didn't know SQL or other software except for Excel? I wonder if you have any tips on how to interview in this situation. All the data analyst positions I've checked require so many technical skills: data warehousing, advanced SQL etc."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hi Alex,that was a great one of your videos and I am thankful for this kinda informations.I have just wondered these salaries net or brut?"
ya28cb3zFGE,"I complete a bachelor degree in business and I have already some basic knowledge in SQL, Power BI, Tableau and Excel. I want to increase my knowledge should I do a master degree in statestic or in programming field to become The best Data Analyst ever? 😆 Thank you for your videos you are very helpful."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Congrats to you! Amazing job! Thanks for creating this video to inspire people like me. 
I just got hired today for my first data analyst job and hopefully I get to 6 figure salary in 3 years like you! #goals"
ya28cb3zFGE,Who see the cat ? Thumbs up for video
ya28cb3zFGE,"You really gave me motivation to learn more to become a data analyst , Thank you a lot <3"
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hey , can you please suggest me some  free source or you tube channel for learning excel for data analyst job ?"
ya28cb3zFGE,Hey Alex! Thanks for your video. What did you study in college??? Psychology??
ya28cb3zFGE,So Data science would be the next step ...Thanks
ya28cb3zFGE,"I love the way you recounted your path! It’s important especially for younger people who are really starting from the bottom, that this doesn’t happen overnight and it is possible regardless of where you’re currently at. It’s about keeping your eyes open for new opportunities and going for them! Best wishes to you and your family!"
ya28cb3zFGE,"What about having no experience, coming out of college, and wanting a job as a data analyst?"
ya28cb3zFGE,sir are data structure and algorithm asked in data science jobs?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hi Alex, thanks for sharing! Your story is similar to mine. I also have an undergrad degree in health. I ended up working for a healthcare startup where I worked as a junior analyst. This was where my SQL and Tableau skills accelerated because I had to learn as I go. Now I’m working for one of the largest consulting firms. I eventually went back to get a master in tech/ds while working full time. I felt the need to keep up with my other colleagues who have their undergrad degrees in cs."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Wow! This is an amazing video! I am  on a very similar track, as I work for a nonprofit now as a ""Life Sills Instructor."" I have 2 previous Associate degrees, one being in Radiologic Technology (never worked in the field).  I am 4 weeks out from a Bachelor's degree in Health Information Management! I want to transition to Health care data analytics...but looking for the right path to build solid experience.  Any advise?"
ya28cb3zFGE,76k hourly? Or yearly
ya28cb3zFGE,76k hourLy??? 😂😂😂
ya28cb3zFGE,"many Chinese companies offer 30-60k RMB*16month for data analytics. I worked as it/e-commerce/retail finance company with salary about 450k/year, but the salary is shrinking for audit in market and companies pay less value on it. That's why i want be a data analyst keep focusing on key things. But it's really hard to transit cuz they cares alot about previous titles."
ya28cb3zFGE,thank you for sharing your journey.  it gives me hope.  how would I create a portfolio with no job experience?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Alex, that is an amazing track. I am majoring in Data Science at the College of Charleston, so I appreciate you sharing your work history with everyone."
ya28cb3zFGE,Thanks Alex for making so much helpful videos. I recently transitioned from software engineer to data analyst. I felt I made the correct move but when I check the salary online its always showing 60-70k is average salary but I am getting paid more then that. Worried if I change companies will I be able to find a better opportunity with higher salary same as you. Also will my software engineering help in my path in any way? Future goal is to be Data Scientist or Salesforce Dev. Sorry for long question
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hi Alex
 Great inspirational video. 
Infact I also want to transition my career from digital marketing to data science. Please advise"
ya28cb3zFGE,So what was your major in college ?
ya28cb3zFGE,i was considering making a video about my salary too because ive seen so many of these now. But in germany it is not appropriate to talk about salaries and i think my contract(s) forbids me to talk about that with colleagues so im not sure about how that is regulated by law
ya28cb3zFGE,Alex. Your story is very similar to mine. I sent you a connect request on LinkedIn.
ya28cb3zFGE,You're so inspirational my brother. I salute you. Any ways we could link up for some one on one advice?
ya28cb3zFGE,This data analyst job seems like the hidden gem type career because it seems like the best job to transition to
ya28cb3zFGE,So Alex do u want to change your career from data analyst to data scientist ?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Dallas resident here also, love the content ! Inspiring story and I feel I can relate, what are some of your future goals?  Glad I stumbled across your channel."
ya28cb3zFGE,In my first job as a Data Analyst I was making 65k for a big company. Now I have another job as a Data Analyst after two years and I'm now making 50k for a smaller company. The salary is low though in my opinion and I live in North Carolina.
ya28cb3zFGE,You're such an inspiration.
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hey mate, neat videos! I'm an environmental engineer w/ masters in renewable energy wanting to career transition into Data Analysis. How long did it take you to land your first job as an analyst from when you decided to have a career change? How many hours a day did you train for?
-Cheers"
ya28cb3zFGE,"About my career progression. I went from insurance sales making 30k a year, for 2 years, to working at a call center sales for 5 years, to landing a data analyst role, unfortunately took a paycut for my first analyst role but I am making more money now that I have before. I've had 3 Data analyst positions the past 4 years with increasing salary with each one."
ya28cb3zFGE,That's pretty amazing. I'm doing well. I just got a new BI Data Analyst position where I'm learning more advanced SQL and I have a project using python. I am looking forward to eventually having a more senior role.
ya28cb3zFGE,What degree did you graduate with?
ya28cb3zFGE,How can data analyst work from home?
ya28cb3zFGE,"How Can i woork on project for improve my résumé ??
There is a good Sources to began??"
ya28cb3zFGE,"Your videos are always inspiring! I'm finishing my marketing degree and we haven't seen too many things related to data tbh, I'd love to become a data analyst by the time I'm 30 (I'm 21 right now), I think I'd have lots of great opportunities with a marketing degree! It's a tough path to self-learn data analysis, but it seems like it's definitely worth it :)"
ya28cb3zFGE,What is the difference between an entry level data analyst and a junior data analyst? Just graduated and I’ve been applying to data analyst positions. Thank you.
ya28cb3zFGE,"As they say, is it necessary to learn r code and work on tableau.....cz I'm thinking of a career in it."
ya28cb3zFGE,"Very similar to a path I'm attempting to achieve! I graduated with a master's degree in exercise science in 2017. Yes, a boneheaded move on my part. Why? Exercise science is considered a useless degree by many and I'm probably one of many that are living proof. I made 16k in 2018, and a whopping 18k in 2019!  I've had had seven jobs the past three years, with five of them paying at or near minimum wage. Another job was personal training. I could not sell my way out of a paper bag to make that gig work. I also had a part time teaching job at a community college but was not selected for rehire the following year. Now, I have been self-teaching myself the skills needed to get into data science for the past year. My goal is to gain an entry level data analyst job so I can build my skills more and put myself through college again to pursue a quantitative degree.  Gaining an entry level data analyst job where I make even 40k would be like winning the lottery! Earning 100k, I might probably feel like I died and went to heaven. Why? I will be able to pay off my 100k student loan debt and start living life!"
ya28cb3zFGE,Would you say getting sql certified as a recent college grad would help me get my foot in the door for a healthcare analyst job?
ya28cb3zFGE,"Awesome video, so happy for you that you had such a successful transition into data! I currently work as a PA, but I'm taking intro classes in R and data science in my spare time. I hope to move out of clinical medicine and into data science/analytics in the next 3 years, do you have any advice to help me get there?"
ya28cb3zFGE,What do you have a degree in?
ya28cb3zFGE,You really worked your way to the top! Amazing and inspiring!
ya28cb3zFGE,"Hi Alex. Stumbled across your video, thanks for the helpful info!"
ya28cb3zFGE,"Good vid . Been looking for a data analyst channel to follow for a while now 
Got that bell on"
ya28cb3zFGE,"thanks for the great video 
my mum and dad are both data analysts and I wanna be so your channel helps me a lot
even though I'm only 12 I'm still thinking about my life"
ya28cb3zFGE,"Loved the video, and an amazing transition into data analytics. Wish you all the best! Subscribed too!"
ya28cb3zFGE,"Where can I go to practice SQL - could you recommend sites with good exercises? I think I'm more of the 'learn by doing' type when it comes to learning programming, rather than go through 30 hour Udemy courses which I don't have patience for. I also like looking at others' finished/correct code for exercises and seeing what they did, and manipulate my code bit-by-bit until I get it right. Thanks!"
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,POV: your watching all his videos in order from oldest to most recent 😁😁
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Nice one
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Very helpful!
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,"Bro, you are spitting straight facts in this video. Overall, your videos have been extremely helpful as I begin my transition as well."
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,You look a bit like bill blurr 😂🤟
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Thanks
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Hi.. I wanna switch jobs. Already did google data analytic course in coursera. Have good knowledge in excel and SQL. Any advices for my next step? Thank you. 💙
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,I think it would sound good without music.
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Agreeeed!
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Thanks.  Agree
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,Where do you live?
Hsi2BG0SOiQ,"Can waiting around for other people to send you things in order to be able to do your job reflect negatively on your performance? 
Do your supervisors generally understand the situation and are fine with submitting the work last minute? 
Does it also make you feel stressed out that you won't be able to submit something on time because you waisted 3 days doing nothing and have everything left for the last few hours? 
Are there days where you are just looking at the clock waiting to go home because you don't have anything to do, or are you always working on multiple projects at the same time so there is always some deadline that you are focused on?"

6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex, thank you for providing such great content. It has been helpful in my pursuit of a Data Analyst career. Your suggestion of knowing SQL, Python, and Excel has helped me narrow down my focus on what to learn. One question, would you also recommend learning visualization tools such as Power BI/Tableau? Or would the 3 skills you recommended in this video be sufficient for pursuing an entry level Data Analyst role? Thanks again and keep up the great videos!"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Thank you for the great content, I'm a new subscriber and would like to ask you if should learn Microsoft SQL or Oracle SQL to increase my odds of getting hired? Thanks."
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex, thanks for making these insightful videos you make. I have question. I am thinking to switch my career I have 9 years experience in HR and I have master degree in HR management. Do you think I can switch to data analyst. I have been leaning SQL and python. But since I have no mathematics background, I am but skeptical if I can. Thanks again for your support."
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex,
I need a suggestion from you. I'm basically a Python developer , I know data visualization too. Do I have to learn Tableau as well?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,Thank you! Liked to help with the algorithm and because I really enjoyed the video!
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hey Alex,
for the past few days, I have been looking into data-driven courses.
what type of higher education can data analyst pursue like; masters or MBA."
6lQzbk6_OTw,This is a very great video! I know some basic sql skills. I am wondering what excel vba and python skills is needed for an entry level data analyst role?
6lQzbk6_OTw,Thank you!! for these most informative videos.

6lQzbk6_OTw,"Top 3 Data Analyst Hard Skills:
1. SQL - Creating statements and queries to clean data, exporting to excel for reports and visualizations, automation, creating reports, sending e-mails.
2. Python - Data visualization, automation
3. Excel - Makes communication convenient."
6lQzbk6_OTw,"I know SQL basics should I learn more like procedures and advance SQL 
And in python ...basics of it and seaborn numpy that's it or advance also required"
6lQzbk6_OTw,hi Alex i am willing to learn all it takes to be a data analyst but im scared i wont get a job as i lack experience ...what can i do?i would really appreciate an answer just anything that can push me right now please and thanks
6lQzbk6_OTw,Alex can you make a video that the skill path of a data analyst means which skill should I need to learn first iam totally confused . Can you please clarify with the doubt with a video ?
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Thanks Alex!!  I have a question about SQL. Which tools or platforms did you use when you first time study SQL. I’m using Gitbash terminal as I want to see how the statements work in command line environment, but there are some limitation when I try to visualize multiple tables. And so I just wanted to ask you if there are some effective tools that I can practice SQL statements as for real life project example."
6lQzbk6_OTw,"I was curious if at any of your positions if you had to do a lot of calculations and build sophisticated tables and such from the data?   I am transitioning to a data analytics position with my company and becoming an excel power user from a data manipulation standpoint inside excel seems to be the first big step.  Any advice on how to become an excel data analytics expert, and is this typical in the industry?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Where does math and statistics come in , and what area should one focus on? Please help answer this burning questions"
6lQzbk6_OTw,No need to be a code writer. Every DBMS has a visual query builder that you can use. All the automation can be done with Power Query using GUI. Advanced excel is nessesery of cours.
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hey Alex, would I be able to work remotely from home as a data analyst?!
As I from India could I work for any US company from here?! How do I get it?!"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex,
Is there any possiblity for a data analyst to become a data scientist ? And is ms in analytics good?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,Is there any particular order for learning these skills?
6lQzbk6_OTw,could R be another skill that is crucial and be replaced over python?
6lQzbk6_OTw,Thank you.
6lQzbk6_OTw,Another great video! I am currently working with SQL and will move onto Python next. When do you think it is a good time to transition from SQL and focus on Python?
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex,
it would be of much help if you could give the list of all skills required."
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hey Alex , I want to make a career in data analysis so I purchased a Udemy course of MySQL n I am done learning the basics..can u tell me where can I get real time projects to work on my skill ?? Also should I learn a visualisation tool like power bi, tableau or should I learn the part of excel used for data analytics ??"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex, I see many recruitments require SPSS as a skill of DA. Can I ask you does it really helpful for a DA ? Do you often use it ?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex,What do u mean by python .Python +pandas +matlplot  or just python . Actually Without pandas I don't think we can do analysis ?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Alex please don't stop making videos mate, these videos are really valuable"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex
I think your videos are interesting and very helpful. I’ve been studying on SQL and Python but I don’t know what is a useful way to practice this. Can you share your way when you learnt?
Thanks a lot & looking forward to your next video."
6lQzbk6_OTw,"hey Alex , i really enjoyed watching ur video and i am wondering if i need use Statistics when i analyze data ,, and what resources or books  do u recommend me learn from it ?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,Please make video on full skills for data analysis
6lQzbk6_OTw,"One thing to add is that there are many tools and if a person doesn’t know Python then Power BI, Tableau, DOMO, and Qlik are all great options for data visualizations. 

I see more data scientists using R and Python but isn’t a bad thing to learn. There are well over 60+ tools for data analysis and that’s what makes it fun or frustrating lol. Good vid!"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hey Alex. Thanks for reviewing my resume and great work with videos. I have both SQL and Python skills and some excel. How advanced of an Excel skill do you need? I can do regular stuff no problem but stuff like vlookup,etc? Also in regards to SQL, how advanced do you need to know? I use SQL daily so i can run queries no problem but I don't use Stored Procedures, Triggers, etc. Also did you find that you need to know SQL Database setup stuff as well? Thanks"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hey Alex, what do you think about COGNOS?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Hi Alex,
found your channel on Reddit and am grateful for your content.
I am currently working as an analyst while waiting for September to start with my masters. I am working in a start-up here in Germany and anything is so vague and open which is good as I have a lot of freedom in my work but on the other hand, there's a lot of pressure externally as well internally to do well and come up with great insights. Currently, I have been working on some projects by myself and sometimes I lack a little bit of creativity to come up with reasonable metrics and KPIs to measure. Do you have any tips for generating insights? How can I improve in that regard?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,"Great video, Alex! I definitely agree that Excel and SQL is top 3. But do you think companies prefer an applicant with knowledge in a data viz tool (Tableau, Power BI, or QlikView ) over Python?"
6lQzbk6_OTw,Your thoughts on Google Sheets compared to Excel?
